we have `an old saying`: “tian gao, huangdi yuan,” or, “the emperor is `as far away as the sky`.” We use it to `reassure` ourselves 
有句`老话`，叫“天高皇帝远”。我们用它来`宽慰`自己

a professor in international relations explained that Singapore was an `authoritarian state`, where the government `wielded tremendous control` over citizens’ daily lives.
一位国际关系教授解释说，新加坡是一个`专制国家`，政府对民众的日常生活`指手画脚`。

we could `follow the commentary` posted by `public intellectuals` there, so we `wouldn’t have to simply accept the government’s narrative`
可以在上面关注那些`公共知识分子`发表的评论，这样我们`就不用只接受政府的一面之词`

I `couldn’t wait to` go back home; I believed `it was poised to` become a place where idealists like me would `thrive`.
我`迫不及待地`想回家；我相信它会成为一个像我这样的理想主义者`如鱼得水的`地方

security checks `were instituted` in the subway system. We `grew used to` policemen checking people’s identity cards in interchange stations.
地铁系统`增加了`安检。慢慢地，我们`习惯了`警察在换乘站检查身份证。

a story that had `gone viral` in my WeChat `feeds overnight`: “A BBC reporter challenged China’s surveillance network — and it took only seven minutes to capture him!” I couldn’t tell which terrified me more: China’s `all-encompassing network of facial recognition` surveillance cameras, or that my `countrymen` were proudly cheering them on.
看到一篇`一夜走红的`报道：“BBC记者挑战中国天网工程，潜逃七分钟后被抓获！”我说不出哪个更让我害怕：是中国`无所不在的`人脸识别监控摄像头网络，还是我的同胞们在骄傲地为它喝彩。

Entering train stations felt like crossing border control at an international airport — my identity was not only confirmed by someone checking my documents, but also by one of the `ubiquitous facial recognition cameras`. 
进入火车站就像在国际机场通过边境管制一样——不仅有人检查我的文件并确认我的身份，`无处不在的面部识别摄像头`也在确认我的身份

Our `mind-set`, `long ago`, `was wired to` see safety and freedom as `an either-or choice`
`长久以来`，我们的`思维定势`是将安全和自由视为`非此即彼的选择`

As the United States and China `edge closer to` a trade agreement, the ability to reach a final deal is `coming down to` a central question: Will Beijing `live up to` its promises?
随着美国和中国距离一项贸易协议`越来越近`，最终达成协议将`取决于`一个核心问题：北京是否会`兑现`其承诺？

But it `remains unclear` which `provisions` of the trade deal will `be subject to enforcement` and how much power the United States will have to punish Beijing if it `reneges on` the agreement. The ability to `secure a firm commitment` from China to `hold up its end of the pact` or face repercussions will be a key determinant in whether President Trump’s trade deal is seen as a true win or a `capitulation`.
但目前`尚不清楚`贸易协议的哪些`条款`在这种执行的范围之内，以及如果北京`违反协议`，美国将拥有多大的惩罚权力。特朗普总统的贸易协议是被视为真正的胜利还是投降，关键决定因素将在于能否让中国`明确承诺`会`履行协议`，否则要面临报复。

China experts say enforcement is necessary `given that` the United States wants Beijing to `make significant structural changes` that will take time.
中国问题专家表示，`鉴于`美国希望北京做出的`重大结构改革`并非短时间内能完成，执行的机制是必要的

“I `remain very cautious on` this,” Mr. Allen said. “Will the Chinese really `renounce` the ability to `retaliate` at what they feel is an unfair trade action? I think it `defies` Chinese tradition.”
“我对此`仍然非常谨慎`，”艾伦说。“中国人真的会`放弃报复的能力`，哪怕看到他们认为不公平的贸易行为？我认为这`不符合中国的一贯方式`。”

Mr. Trump, who met with a Chinese delegation in the `Oval Office` last week, said negotiators might require four more weeks to finish `ironing out` the deal.
特朗普上周在椭圆形办公室会见了中国代表团，他表示谈判代表可能需要再过四周才能最终`敲定协议`。

I `remain confident` in the `prospects` of a deal, but I think we need to be `cleareyed` and understand that China could `walk away` from expected commitments in purchases, market access, intellectual property and other areas if they don’t get something out of this deal, and that’s `tariff relief`
我对交易的前景仍然`充满信心`，但我认为我们需要`保持清醒的头脑`，并且明白如果不能从协议中获得些什么，中国可能会放弃采购、市场准入、知识产权及其他方面预计会有的承诺，而他们想要的就是`关税减免`。

Far from `panicking` at his `misfortun`e, he used his five months of severance pay to `hang out` for a few weeks with friends and `ponder` other career options
他非但没有对自己的`厄运`感到`恐慌`，反而用他拿到的五个月的遣散费和朋友们潇洒了几周，`琢磨`其他的职业选择

Yet as the Ford layoffs show, `economic warning signs` are starting to `emerge` in China. Inflation has `gradually crept up`. Economic growth has slowly `eroded`.
然而，如福特的裁员所显示的那样，`经济预警信号`已开始在中国`出现`。通货膨胀率已`逐渐上升`。经济增长则在慢慢`减缓`。

A huge `pedestrian plaza` in the Guanyinqiao neighborhood `pulses with` lights and crowds even on weekday nights. The trees are `illuminated with bright lanterns`.
观音桥附近的一个`巨大的步行广场`灯火通明，即使在工作日的晚上也是人潮涌动。树上`挂着明亮的灯笼`。

Under the ground `burrows` an extensive subway system. The monorail and subway were almost `entirely` built in the last 15 years.
城市的地下有一个`巨大的`地铁系统。单轨和地铁几乎都是在过去15年里建起来的。

Mr. Bo `ended up` sentenced to life in prison for bribetaking, `embezzlement` and abuse of power.
最终因受贿、`贪污`和滥用职权被判处无期徒刑。

From the Altai Mountains to the Pacific Coast, `logging` is `ravaging` Russia’s vast forests, leaving behind `swathes of scarred` earth `studded with dying stumps`.
从阿尔泰山脉到太平洋沿岸，`砍伐`正在`毁坏`俄罗斯广袤的森林，之后留下的，是`伤痕累累的`土地上遍布着的`垂死树桩`。

Since China began restricting commercial logging in its own natural forests two decades ago, it has `increasingly` turned to Russia, importing huge amounts of wood in 2017 to satisfy the `voracious appetite` of its construction companies and furniture manufacturers.
自二十年前开始限制本国天然森林的商业采伐以来，中国已`日益`将矛头转向俄罗斯，2017年进口了巨量木材，以满足其建筑公司和家具制造商的`巨大需求`。

Environmentalists say China has simply shifted the harm of `unbridled` logging from home to abroad, even as it `reaps` the economic benefits. Some warn that the scale of logging today could `deplete` what `unspoiled` forests remain, `contributing to` global warming.
环保主义者称，中国只是把`肆无忌惮的`采伐的危害从国内转移到了海外，甚至从中`获得了`经济利益。一些人士警告称，今天的伐木规模可能会`耗尽未遭破坏的森林`，从而`加剧`全球变暖。

It is one thing for Chinese demand to `overwhelm` small, poor nations `desperate for cash`, but it is another for it to `drain the resources` of a far larger country, one that regards itself as a superpower and a strategic partner to China.
中国的需求令`急需现金的`穷困小国`无法招架`是一回事，`耗尽一个大国的资源`就是另一回事了，而这个国家还将自己视为超级大国，以及中国的战略伙伴。

What we are doing now in Siberia and the Far East is destroying what is left of the original `intact forest landscapes`
我们眼下在西伯利亚和远东所做的事情正在把仅存的`原始森林风景`毁掉

The total value of China’s `timber imports` — `rough logs, timber or wood pulp` — has increased more than 10 times since China began restricting logging at home in 1998
1998年中国开始限制国内伐木以来，中国的`木材进口`总价值—`粗原木、木材或木浆`—增长了10倍以上

In many `rural areas` of the Russian `Far East` and Siberia, there are few other ways to make money, or to make a living, than `stripping natural resources` of the vast surrounding forests
在俄罗斯`远东`和西伯利亚的`许多农村地区`，除了`剥夺`周围大片森林的自然资源，几乎没有其他赚钱或谋生的方式

When pressed, she `declined to` discuss her `concessions` in detail, but according to the company’s website, she had invested $20 million in Russia by 2015
在被追问时，她`拒绝`谈论自己的`特许权`的详情，但该公司网站显示，截至2015年，她已在俄罗斯投资了2000万美元

The business can be `quite profitable`, especially when Bitcoin prices are `soaring`, but the process requires `considerable amounts of electricity`.
这项业务`非常有利可图`，特别是在比特币价格`飙升`的时候，但这个过程需要`耗费大量电力`

At one point, China `accounted for roughly two-thirds` of all Bitcoin produced.
中国一度占到比特币`总算力的三分之二左右`。

But China `keeps a tight grip` over how much money flows in and out of its borders, and cryptocurrencies — which are traded on decentralized computer networks and allow people to make transactions anonymously — threatened to `undermine` those capital controls.
但中国`严格控制`资金的进出，而加密货币在分散的计算机网络上交易，并允许人们匿名交易，这就有可能`破坏`它对资本的管制。

The Chinese authorities began to `ratchet up pressure` on Bitcoin miners.
中国当局开始对比特币矿工`施压`

Just since 1990, the `mortality rate` for children under 5 has fallen in China by 83 percent — suggesting, by my calculations, that an additional 676,000 Chinese children survive each year who previously would have died.
自1990年以来，中国五岁以下儿童`死亡率`下降了83%——根据我的计算，这意味着中国每年新增67.6万名儿童存活下来，在此之前他们可能死亡。

I `used to believe` that China was best approached `with ambivalence`, but in the last few years the ambivalence has `faded into wariness`.
我`曾经认为`，与中国打交道最好是`带着点矛盾心理`，但在最近几年，这种矛盾已`逐渐演变成警惕`。

First, `to the extent possible`, we should try to `curb` Chinese high-technology firms’ access to Western markets. These businesses are a security threat, and the Trump administration `is right to be concerned`. If a company like Huawei is asked to cooperate with Chinese State Security spies, its executives simply can’t say no.
首先，我们应该`尽可能地``限制`中国高科技公司进入西方市场。这些企业是安全威胁，特朗普政府`有理由感到担忧`。如果像华为这样的公司被要求与中国国家安全间谍合作，它的高管们肯定不会说不。

China purchased a Boeing 767 in 2000 to be its presidential jet and it arrived `riddled with listening devices`. China `inevitably` will `try to do to us what we already did to it`.
2000年，中国购买了一架波音767飞机作为其领导人专机，飞机交付时`安装了许多监听设备`。中国将会`试图对我们做的事情，我们也做过`，这是`不可避免的`。

A few days ago, China announced that it would soon `ban all variants of` fentanyl, a welcome step that may `make a difference`. But China often promises cooperation that does not `materialize`, and everything will depend on `enforcement` over the country’s 160,000 chemical companies. Too many lives `hang in the balance` to take China at its word.
几天前，中国宣布将很快`禁止所有种类的`芬太尼，这是一个令人欣喜的举措，可能会`产生效果`。但中国承诺的合作经常得不到`实现`，一切将取决于对中国16万家化工企业的`执法`。这关系到太多生命，不能只听中国嘴上说说就当真。

Neighbors become `informants`. Children are `interrogated`. `Mosques` are monitored.
邻居成为`告密者`。儿童遭到`审问`。`清真寺`被监控。

Muslim minorities `line up, stone-faced, to swipe their official identity cards`. At big checkpoints, they `lift their chins` while a machine takes their photos, and wait to be notified if they can go on.
少数民族穆斯林`面无表情地排队刷身份证`。大型岗哨会有机器给他们拍照，他们`抬起下巴`，等待放行通知。

The extra money is not coming from Juilliard. The local government is `footing the bill`. And that could become a problem for officials `struggling with debt` after an epic `spending spree` to develop a new commercial center `from scratch`.
额外的钱不是由茱莉亚学院出资，而是由当地政府`埋单`。对已经在`大举花钱`从无到有建起一座商业中心的政府而言，这可能会成为问题。

Four-fifths of the office space `stands empty`. Construction on other buildings has stopped, leaving skeletons in the sky. A `sprawling mall` has few shoppers. 
其中五分之四的办公空间`是空的`。其他建筑物的建设已经停止，只留下高耸的骨架。一个`庞大的`购物中心几乎没有顾客。

Chinese local governments are `swimming in debt`. By official accounts, that debt totals $4.5 trillion. By unofficial estimates, it could be `as large as $10 trillion`. `No one knows for sure` because much of the borrowing for projects like the Tianjin Juilliard campus is `rarely disclosed`.
中国地方政府`债台高筑`。据官方统计，债务总额为4.5万亿美元。据非官方估计，这一数字可能`高达10万亿美元`。`没有人确切知道`，因为像天津茱莉亚音乐学院这种项目的贷款`很少被披露`。

But China is not growing `as fast as it used to`, and it is not clear that the “build it and they will come” model will save Yujiapu and other places with big debts. The national government now must find other ways to `spur growth` — without `making the debt problem worse`.
但中国的经济增长速度已不如从前，“只要盖好了，一切都会来”的模式能否拯救于家堡等债台高筑的地方，目前还不清楚。国家政府现在必须找到其他方法来`刺激经济增长`—同时不让债务问题`更加恶化`。

If Yujiapu really is the Manhattan of China, it has a way to go to `catch up to the real thing`. Its `avenues`, some nearly as wide as Broadway, are `eerily quiet`.
如果于家堡真是中国的曼哈顿，那它还有很长的路要走。它的`街道`有些几乎和百老汇一样宽，但是`出奇的安静`

If the `political will collapses` for the Binhai area, then the bank loans will begin to `dry up` and the whole area is in trouble
如果滨海新区的`政治意志崩溃`，那么银行贷款将开始`枯竭`，整个地区都会陷入困境

Many residents believe Yujiapu’s problems have been `overstated` and try to `cast its emptiness in a positive light`
许多居民认为于家堡的问题被`夸大`了，并试图`从正面看待空置现象`

“Now, there are `quite a lot of` internet companies, including some e-commerce platforms,” he said, `speculating` that these companies could move into his building in the future.
“现在你看互联网公司就比较多了，包括一些电商平台，”他说，他`猜测`这些公司将来会搬进他所在的大楼。

Just as he had on previous trips, Zhu Feng `bolted down` his lunch at the Los Angeles airport before `sprinting to catch` his Air China flight back to Beijing.
和前几次旅行时一样，朱峰在洛杉矶机场`匆匆吃完`午餐后，`跑去赶`中国国际航空公司的航班回北京。

They `flipped to` the well-used 10-year visa to the United States and `crossed out` the page with a black pen.
他们`翻到`已经用过多次的来美10年签证那页，用一支黑笔在上面`打了个大叉`。

Now, that door appears to be closing, with the two nations `ramping up their strategic rivalry` and each regarding academic visitors from the other with greater suspicion — of espionage, commercial theft and `political meddling`.
现在，这扇门似乎正在关闭，两国之间的`战略竞争日益加剧`，彼此都对对方的学术访问者有更大的怀疑，怀疑他们从事间谍活动、商业盗窃和`政治干预`。

“These people are among the most `sophisticated` in how the U.S. works and are some of the `strongest advocates` of good relations with the United States,”
We are `alienating` some of America’s best friends in China.”
“这些人中有些是`最了解`美国如何运作的人，也是`最强烈主张`与美国保持良好关系的人，我们正在`疏远`美国在中国的一些最好的朋友。”

`A driving rain lashed the hills` while the premier was there on Thursday.
在总理到访的周二，`山上下起了暴雨`。

The `reassuring language` was part of `a broader effort` to convince `increasingly skeptical` European nations that China comes in peace.
此种`安抚性的表述`属于`一项总体行动`的一部分，其目标是让`日益持怀疑态度的`欧洲国家确信，中国没有恶意。

The `thickening ranks` of China’s economic allies have left European officials `increasingly wary`. Last month, Italy formally signed on to China’s vast ‘‘One Belt, One Road’’ project, new Silk Road into Europe. On Friday, the summit meeting was `capped by Greece’s announcement` that it had joined, too.
中国经济盟友队伍的`扩大`使欧洲官员`越来越警惕`。上月，意大利正式加入中国庞大的“一带一路”项目，即进入欧洲的新丝绸之路。在周五的峰会上，希腊也宣布加入。

That does not mean that `all is roses` even between China and its newly `forged economic allies` in the group. But by `aggressively courting the nations` on Europe’s eastern and `southern flank`, Western officials worry that China is `stoking division` within the European Union.
这并不意味着`一团和气`，即便在中国和集团内的`新经济盟友`之间都谈不上。但是，如此`大举拉拢`欧洲东部和`南部侧翼`的国家，令西方官员担心中国正在`加剧欧盟内部的分裂`。

“I think that the fact that today we became `17 plus one` is the good news of the day,” Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tspiras said on Friday. “I look forward to working with all of you `in the framework of this initiative` in `full respect of the rules and procedures` of the European Union.”
“我认为，今天我们成为`17+1`这一事实是重大利好，”希腊总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯(Alexis Tspiras)周五表示。“我期待在`充分尊重欧盟规则和程序`的情况下，在这项`倡议的框架内`与大家合作。”

China’s presence is no longer `a novelty` in this part of Europe, where its track record is `decidedly more complicated` than it was when the `economic bloc` was formed.
在欧洲的这一区域，中国的存在已经不是`新鲜事`，但此时中国的过往表现`无疑`要比`经济集团`形成时更复杂。

Similarly, the Czech Republic, led by the `avowed Sinophile` President Milos Zeman, has traditionally been among Europe’s `most solicitous` nations. But calls by its cybersecurity agency to limit the use of Huawei as well as the tech giant ZTE in critical infrastructure have `infuriated` Beijing.
捷克共和国在`公开表示亲华的`总统米洛什·泽曼领导下，历来是对中国`最热情的`欧洲国家之一。但其网络安全机构同样要求限制华为和科技巨头中兴在关键基础设施中的使用，令北京`大为光火`。

In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban declared his China friendly ‘‘Opening to the East’’ policy in 2010, and has sought to `use the prospect of a flood of money` from China as leverage in his `ongoing battles` with Brussels over his government’s `authoritarian drift`. Yet there have been no major new Chinese investments for the past seven years.
在匈牙利，总理欧尔班·维克托(Viktor Orban)2010年宣布了对中国友好的“向东开放”政策，并在同欧盟就其政府的`威权主义倾向`展开的`持续斗争`中，`利用中国资金大量涌入的前景`为筹码。然而，在过去七年里，中国没有进行任何重大的新投资。

“Instead of `engaging endlessly` with China and `pleading for` it to change its ways,” said Francois Godement, a senior adviser for Asia at the Institut Montaigne in Paris, “the Commission suggests that Europe should change track and `adopt` a set of robust defensive policies, some of which will have an effect whatever China’s response may be.”
“与其`无休止地与中国接触`，`恳求`中国改变它的方式，”巴黎蒙田研究所的资深亚洲问题专家顾德明说，“欧盟委员会建议，欧洲应该改变方向，`采用`一套坚定的防御政策，其中一些无论中国作出什么反应都会起作用。”

Now, China has agreed to cut the price tag on the project by one-third to $11 billion, in a `tacit acknowledgment` that the economics of the original deal did not `make financial sense`.
现在，中国已同意将该项目的价格降低三分之一，减为110亿美元，默认了原来的协议在`经济上行不通`。

the program provided a way to use the country’s `economic clout` to build trade ties and win friends across Asia, Africa and Europe
该项目为利用中国的`经济影响力`建立贸易联系，在亚洲、非洲和欧洲广交朋友提供了一条途径。

As the new government began to `pare back the debt`, Mr. Mahathir announced that the administration would halt the East Coast Rail Link project and the gas pipeline deal, `citing the high costs`.
随着新政府开始`削减债务`，马哈蒂尔宣布，`由于成本高昂`，政府将暂停东海岸铁路线项目和天然气管道交易。

The `shaky` video clips of Julian Assange’s arrest `flashed around the world` Thursday, the white-bearded `prophet` of the age of leaks being `hauled` by `unsmiling` security officers to a gray van marked Police.
朱利安·阿桑奇(Julian Assange)周四被捕的场面被`晃动的`视频捕捉下来，`迅速在全球范围内传播`。这位蓄着白胡子的泄密时代`先知`，被`面无笑容的`安保人员`拖上`了一辆带有“警察”字样的灰色面包车。

It was also the latest — and surely not the last — `dramatic turn` in a career marked by both brilliant achievement and `dubious judgment`. Assange has long had `a knack for celebrity`, and as a `tech-savvy`, global, almost `stateless figure`, he captured the new influence the internet could give to individual citizens.
这也是他职业生涯中最新的—当然也不会是最后一次—`戏剧性转折`，这段生涯既有辉煌的成就，也有令人`起疑的判断`。长期以来，阿桑奇`深谙成名之道`。作为一个`精通技术`、四海为家、`几乎没有国籍的`人物，他抓住了互联网可能给个体民众带来的新影响力。

But Assange has always `elicited fervent reactions`: He has been `hailed as a hero` of free information, or `despised` as a treacherous criminal worthy of death by drone
但阿桑奇总是`引发强烈的反应`：他或者`被誉为`公开信息的英雄；或者被`鄙视为`一个变节的罪犯，应该被无人机处死

Assange, the world’s most famous `self-proclaimed` political refugee, lived there with his cat in a small corner room
作为世界上最著名的`自封`政治难民，阿桑奇和他的猫住在位于一个角落的小房间里

His words were a `harbinger` of the single charge of conspiracy to `commit computer intrusion` against Assange that the Justice Department unsealed Thursday.
他的话`预示了`美国司法部周四公布的一项对阿桑奇密谋`实施电脑入侵`的指控。

In some ways, Assange, 47, has never fully `shed` the rebellious, secretive ways of the `precocious` Australian teenager with a complicated family background who, with two `pals`, formed a hacking collective called the International Subversives.
在某些方面，现年47岁的阿桑奇从未完全摆脱那个`早熟的`澳大利亚少年叛逆、隐秘的生活方式。他有着复杂的家庭背景，少年时曾与两个`朋友`组成一个名为“国际颠覆者”(International Subversives)的黑客组织。

By 2006, when he founded WikiLeaks, Assange had adopted a `nomadic lifestyle`, `roaming the world` and pronouncing sometimes cryptic principles about secrecy and information
到2006年创建维基解密时，阿桑奇已经开始过着`四处流浪的生活`，`在世界各地漫游`，有时还宣布一些语焉不详的保密和信息原则。

`Bored and harboring doubts` about the war and American foreign policy, she began copying thousands of documents from a classified network onto CDs that she marked as Lady Gaga songs to avoid detection.
出于对战争和美国外交政策的`厌倦和疑虑`，她把一个机密网络中的数千份文件复制到光盘上，并将其标记为Lady Gaga的歌曲，以免被发现。

The War Logs, as they were called, were `published in coordination` with Le Monde, The Guardian and Der Spiegel, and they `shed new light on` civilian casualties, soldiers’ morale, the treatment of detainees and the use of contractors. 
这些被他们称为“战争日志”的文件是与《世界报》(Le Monde)、《卫报》(Guardian)和《明镜周刊》(Der Spiegel)`合作发布的`，让人们对平民伤亡、士兵士气、被拘押者的待遇以及承包商的使用有了`新的了解`。

An editor’s note explained that they provided “a real-time history of the war,” but also `struck an ambivalent chord` about their source, WikiLeaks, which the note said “was not involved in the news organizations’ research, reporting, analysis and writing.”
一份编辑手记解释说，它们提供了“战争的实时历史”；但同时对它们的来源维基解密`表示出矛盾心态`，该手记中写道，维基解密“没有参与新闻机构的研究、报道、分析和写作”。

When the diplomatic cables were published, The Times and other news organizations worked closely with WikiLeaks to `redact names` to protect vulnerable people — but later, in a dispute with a British editor, Assange decided simply to publish the `massive cable` collection without any edits.
公布外交电报时，时报和其他新闻机构曾与维基解密密切合作，`对人名进行涂黑`，以保护会面临危险的人——但后来在与一名英国编辑发生争执后，阿桑奇决定不做任何编辑，直接公布`大量电文`。

Meanwhile, WikiLeaks `was plagued with` infighting, often `touched off` by Assange’s `astringent style and ego`. Two women complained to Swedish authorities about Assange’s sexual conduct with them, `setting off a yearslong quest` of investigators to question him.
与此同时，维基解密被内斗`所困扰`，它们往往是由阿桑奇的`尖刻风格和自负引发的`。两名女性就阿桑奇与她们的性行为向瑞典当局报案，`引发了调查人员对他长达一年的问讯`。

In 2012, Ecuador’s foreign minister announced that Assange was at the embassy in London and had asked for `political asylum`. Small as they were, Assange’s quarters there did not `cramp his desire` to remain `in the limelight`. 
2012年，厄瓜多尔外交部长宣布阿桑奇在该国驻伦敦大使馆，并且申请了`政治庇护`。他在那里的住所很小，但这并没有打击他继续待在`风口浪尖`的愿望。

Eventually, Assange’s `isolation began to wear on him`, He was becoming `deeply depressed` and `wondered about simply walking out`, the friend said, `speaking on the condition of anonymity`. And relations with his hosts were becoming `deeply strained`, even `adversarial`, as diplomats `grew tired of` his behavior. Even Assange’s friends called him difficult, a narcissist with an `outsize view` of his importance and little interest in mundane matters like hygiene.
他终于开始感到孤立无援,这位`不愿透露姓名的`朋友说，他变得`非常沮丧`，想着要不要干脆`直接走出去`。随着外交官们对他的行为`日益厌倦`，他与收留他的人的关系变得`非常紧张`，甚至有`敌意`。连阿桑奇的朋友也称他很难相处，说他非常自恋，把自己`看得过于重要`，对清洁卫生等琐事没什么兴趣。

`Appearing in` the Westminster Magistrates’ Court, his silver hair `tied in a bun`, Assange looked composed in `a navy suit`. The `scene underscored` the obvious: that Assange will use his `legal predicament` as a new platform for his `defiance of authority` and his `crusade` for WikiLeaks.
将一头银发`盘成髻`的阿桑奇`出现在`威斯敏斯特地方法院，身着`深蓝色西装`，看上去泰然自若。`这一幕表明`，阿桑奇显然将利用他的`法律困境`作为一个新的平台，`挑战权威`，为维基解密而战。

A six-month investigation by The New York Times `covering three continents` and including more than 150 interviews has described how Mr. Murdoch and his `feuding sons` turned their `media outlets` into right-wing political influence machines that have `destabilized` democracy in North America, Europe and Australia.
进行了为期六个月的调查，`覆盖三大洲`、包括超过150次采访。透过调查可以看到，默多克与几个`长期不和的儿子`如何将他们的`媒体机构`转变为右翼政治影响力机器，并`破坏`北美、欧洲和澳大利亚的民主。

Here are some `key takeaways` from The Times’s investigation into the Murdoch family and its role in the `illiberal`, right-wing political wave `sweeping the globe`.
以下是对默多克家族调查中的`一些要点`，其中涉及该家族在`席卷全球的反自由主义`、右翼政治浪潮中发挥的作用。

Fox News has long `exerted a gravitational pull` on the Republican Party in the United States, where it most recently `amplified the nativist revolt` that has `fueled` the rise of the far right and the election of President Trump.
长期以来，福克斯新闻一直对美国共和党`施加压力`，后者近年`放大了本土主义的反抗`，进而`推动`极右翼势力的崛起和特朗普总统的当选。

Mr. Murdoch’s newspaper The Sun spent years `demonizing the European Union` to its readers in Britain, where it helped lead the Brexit campaign that persuaded `a slim majority` of voters in a 2016 `referendum` to endorse pulling out of the bloc. `Political havoc` has `reigned` in Britain `ever since`.
默多克手下的报纸《太阳报》(The Sun)多年来一直向英国读者呈现一个被`妖魔化的欧盟`，成为引领脱欧运动、在2016年`公投`中说服`超过半数`选民支持退出欧盟的势力之一。`自那以后`，英国一直深陷`政治混乱`。

At the center of this `upheaval sits` the Murdoch family, a `clan` whose dysfunction has both `shaped and mirrored` the `global tumult` of recent years.
默多克家族位于这一`动荡局面`的中心，这个`家族`本身的紊乱`塑造和映照`了近年来的`全球骚动`。

His two sons are very different people. James wanted the company to become more digitally focused and more `politically moderate`, while Lachlan wanted to `lean into the reactionary politics` of the moment.
他的两个儿子是截然不同的人。詹姆斯希望公司变得更加注重数字化、在`政治上更温和`，而拉克兰则希望能够`趋近当下的反动政治`。

James briefly quit the company in protest. But he was `lured` back by a `carefully crafted` compromise that put Lachlan in charge but allowed James to `save face` by maintaining the `public illusion` that he was the `heir`.
詹姆斯很快退出了公司以示抗议。但又被一个`精心设计的`妥协`诱引`回来，即让拉克兰掌权，但让詹姆斯对外保持他是`继承人`的`错觉`，以帮他`挽回面子`

But all of these `succession plans` — as well as the `lucrative` Disney deal — were `thrown into chaos` last year when Mr. Murdoch broke his spine and collapsed on a `yacht`.
但所有这些`继任计划`—以及`获利丰厚的`迪士尼交易—去年都`陷入了混乱`，当时默多克摔断了脊椎，瘫倒在了一艘`游艇`上。

The Murdoch empire has also `boldly flexed its muscles` in Australia, which was for many years Lachlan’s domain.
默多克帝国还在澳大利亚`大举展示自己的力量`，那里多年来是拉克兰的领地。

In Australia, Lachlan expressed `disdain` for efforts to fight climate change and once `rebuked` the staff at one of his family’s newspapers,
在澳大利亚，拉克兰表达了对抗击气候变化相关努力的`蔑视`，并曾因一则支持同性婚姻的社论，`斥责`过他的家族报纸的员工

They quickly introduced `a slate of` right-wing opinion shows that often focused on race, immigration and climate change.
他们迅速推介了`一系列`右翼观点节目，通常聚焦种族、移民和气候变化。

James wanted to `revamp` the network as a `less partisan` news outlet. He even `floated the idea` of hiring David Rhodes, a CBS executive.
当时，詹姆斯希望将福克斯新闻网`改造`成一个`党派色彩不那么浓厚的`新闻机构。他甚至`提出了`雇用CBS高管戴维·罗兹的想法。

His proposals `went nowhere`. Lachlan and Rupert opposed any change to what they saw as a `winning formula` and decided to stick with Fox’s `incendiary programming`.
他的提议`未能得到采纳`。拉克兰和鲁珀特不同意对他们心目中的`成功方案`做出任何改变，并决定坚持福克斯的`煽动性节目`。

But James believed he had seen `firsthand the damage` that outlets like Fox News were doing to the company.
但詹姆斯相信，他目睹了福克斯新闻等媒体对公司造成的损害。

When did leggings make the leap from `garment` to cultural `lightning rod`? For what are essentially stretchy footless tights in a `seemingly endless array of` patterns and colors, they have been an unexpected source of controversy.
从什么时候开始，紧身裤从一种`服装`变成了文化上的`众矢之的`？这种带有`无数`图案与颜色的弹力不连袜紧身裤成了意想不到的争议之源。

`As a result`, what the leggings `uproar` may have exposed is not so much anyone’s physique `per se`, but rather `a cultural fault line` that runs through generations. 
`因此`，紧身裤`风波`所暴露的，与其说是什么人的身材，还不如说是贯穿几代人的`文化断层`。

Sure, it’s possible that is `overstating the matter`. It’s possible they are just `stretchy footless tights` that are easy to wear.
当然，这有可能`夸大了事实`。它很可能仅仅是一种容易穿上身的`不连袜弹力紧身裤`。

But `judging by` Lululemon’s recent results, which saw net revenue rise 21 percent in the third quarter of 2018, and the fact that part of Levi’s `much-heralded` IPO `was attributed to` the “stretch” now included in jeans to cater to the `leggings market`, this “popular clothing choice” (as The Observer labeled them) is `not going away any time soon`. All this suggests that the Notre Dame `uproar` may not be a `fluke, but a harbinger`.
但`请看Lululemon近期的销售结果`，该品牌在2018年第三季度净营收增长21%；事实上，李维斯(Levi’s)新一轮`大肆宣传的`IPO部分是为`迎合紧身裤市场`而为牛仔裤加入的“拉伸”元素所带来的，因此这种“流行着装选择”（这是《观察者》为紧身裤打上的标签）在`短期内不会消失`。所有这些都表明，圣母大学的`喧嚣`可能不是一种`偶然`，而是`预示`着更多东西。

`Earlier in the day`, Mr. Gou `donned a baseball cap and sunglasses` and visited a temple in Taipei `dedicated to` a popular `Taoist and Buddhist` goddess, Mazu, who `is believed to` protect seafarers.
`当天早些时候`，郭台铭`戴着棒球帽`和太阳镜，前往台北一个`供奉道教和佛教`女神妈祖的寺庙参拜，妈祖`被认为`是航海者的保护神。

`Unlike his rivals`, he has no experience in government, but his personal wealth, estimated by Forbes to exceed $7 billion, will be an asset, `both in terms of prestige` and financing his campaign.
`不同于竞选对手`，他没有从政的经验，但他的个人财富—据《福布斯》(Forbes)估计超过70亿美元—无论是对他的`声望`，还是在提供竞选资金方面，都很有用。

Mr. Gou has `long toyed with the idea of a presidential run`, Mr. Gou’s business background will `set him apart from` candidates in both the parties.
郭台铭`早有竞选总统的念头`,郭台铭的商业背景将使他`有别于`民进党和国民党的其他候选人。

`Just days after` Mr. Trump `lavished praise on` him in Washington, Mr. Gou showed China’s premier, Li Keqiang, around a Foxconn manufacturing facility in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou.
就在特朗普在华盛顿对郭台铭`大加赞扬`的`几天后`，郭台铭带着中国总理李克强参观了富士康位于中国中部城市郑州的一个生产园区。

`Regardless` who emerges as the Kuomintang candidate, the race `promises to focus heavily` on Taiwan’s tricky relationship with China. 
`无论`谁在国民党初选中胜出，台湾与中国大陆的微妙关系都`将成为这次总统大选的重点`。

President Tsai is `facing a primary challenge within her party` from her former premier, William Lai, who is an `outspoken` supporter of independence for Taiwan, `in contrast to` Ms. Tsai’s `pragmatic approach`.
蔡英文总统在党内`面临`着来自前行政院长赖清德的主要挑战。赖清德`直言不讳`地支持台湾独立，这与蔡英文的`务实做法`形成`鲜明对比`。

TikTok, the Chinese video app whose growth has been `as viral as` one of its `lip-synced dance clips`, has `encountered a roadblock` in India.
TikTok的成长速度就像它上面某个`爆红的对口型跳舞视频`一样，现在这款来自中国的视频应用在印度`遇阻`。

The lower court, based in Tamil Nadu State, is `hearing a petition` seeking a `ban` on the app, `on the grounds that` it `spreads pornography` and threatens the `well-being` of children.
泰米尔纳德邦的下级法院正在就寻求`禁止`这款应用的`请愿书举行听证`，`理由是`它`散播`色情信息，危害儿童`健康`。

TikTok’s `lax controls` have also `incurred the wrath` of American regulators.
TikTok`管控上的松懈`也`招致`了美国监管机构的`愤怒`。

Internet companies in the United States `are supposed to seek such consent` before allowing children to use their services, but India has no such regulations. That has left communities `struggling to cope with` technology’s influence on their children.
在美国，互联网企业在允许儿童使用其服务前`要先征得父母同意`，但印度没有这类规定。这已导致众多社区`很难应对`科技对儿童的影响。

`More broadly`, India’s central government is `wrestling with` an `overhaul` of its rules governing online services. 
`更广泛地说`，印度中央政府正`全力以赴`，对其在线服务管理规则进行`全面改革`。

Some Indian officials suspect that China’s government is using popular Chinese apps to `scoop up private data` on Indians.
一些印度官员怀疑，中国政府正在利用这些热门中国应用`采集印度公民的私人信息`。

“Wow, that’s `quite an achievement`!” Quake wrote back. “Hopefully she will `carry to term` …”
“哇，这真是一个`了不起的成就`！”奎克回信说。“希望她能`坚持到分娩`……”

Quake’s interactions with He reflect issues that leading scientific institutions are now `grappling with`.
奎克与贺建奎的互动反映了领先的科研机构目前正在`努力解决`的问题。

Quake is an entrepreneur whose inventions include blood tests to detect Down syndrome in pregnancy and to `avoid organ transplant rejection`.
奎克是一名企业家，他的发明包括用于检测妊娠期唐氏综合症以及`避免器官移植排异`的血液检测。

“I said, ‘That’s a terrible idea. Why would you want to do that?’” Quake `recalled`. “He `kind of pushed back` and it was clear that he wasn’t listening to me.”
“我说，‘这是个糟糕的主意。你为什么要做这个呢？’”奎克`回忆`说。“他`有点反驳`的意思，显然他没听我的话。”

“I didn’t think it was something `he would seriously do`,” said Quake, adding that he assumed if He sought `ethical approval` and was `rebuffed`, “`presumably` he’d stop.”
“我当时没觉得他`会把这事当真`，”奎克说，他接着说他以为贺建奎寻求过`伦理审批`然后被`拒`了，“`很可能`他会罢休。”

“If in my interactions with JK I had any `hint of misconduct`, I would have handled it completely differently. And I think `I would have been very aggressive about telling` people about that.”
奎克在接受采访时表示。“如果在跟JK的互动中，我觉察到了任何`行为不端的迹象`，那么我的处理方式会完全不同。并且我会`非常积极地去通报`这件事。”

He’s response `unsettled` him, he said. “`The little corner-cutting thing came up` again: ‘Well, there were actually two hospitals involved and you know, we had approval from one and we did work at both hospitals.’ And I said, ‘Well you better make sure you `have that straightened out`.’”
他说，贺建奎的回答让他`感到不安`。“`投机取巧的小花招又出现了`：‘实际上有两家医院参与，你知道，我们得到了一家医院的批准，我们在两家医院都在做。’我说，‘你最好`把这个解决好`。’”

Quake `pushed back`: “It is `prudent` to let the peer review process `follow its course`.”
奎克`反驳`说：“让同行评审`按部就班`完成这个过程是`明智之举`。”

“He was `spinning up this huge press thing` around it,” Quake explained in the interview. “`It was going to go well or poorly`, I didn’t really know. But `it wasn’t something I was involved in` and I didn’t want my name on it.”
“他是在围绕这件事`大肆炒作`，”奎克在接受采访时解释说。“我真的`不知道结果是好还是坏`。`但这件事与我无关`，我不想让我的名字出现在上面。”

“What do you want to be when you grow up?”When I was a kid, I `dreaded` the question. 
“长大后你想做什么？”在我的孩提时代，我`害怕`这个问题。

My first `beef with the question` is that it forces kids to define themselves `in terms of` work. When you’re asked what you want to be when you grow up, it’s not `socially acceptable to say`, “A father,” or, “A mother,” let alone, “A person of integrity.” 
对于这个问题我的第一个`不满`是，它逼迫孩子们用一种工作来定义自己。当你被问到长大以后想做什么时，回答“一个父亲”、“一个母亲”在`社交意义上是不可接受的`，更不要说“一个正直的人”了。

Although `having a calling` can be a source of joy, research shows that searching for one leaves students feeling `lost and confused`. And even if you’re `lucky enough to stumble onto a calling`, it might not be a `viable career`.
尽管`拥有天职`会是一种欢乐之源，但研究显示，寻找天职会让学生们感到`迷茫和困惑`。而且即便你`足够幸运碰上了一样天职`，它也可能不是个`可行的职业`。

Maybe four of them could be anything they want to be. But the other 2,000 `had better learn` how to `weld`. He added: “Tell the kids the truth. You can be anything you’re good at — as long as they’re hiring.”
也许他们中有四人可能会成为任何他们想成为的人。但其他2000人`最好学会`怎么`焊接`。他接着说：“跟孩子说实话。你可以去做任何你擅长的事——前提是他们在招人。”

If you `manage to overcome` those `obstacles`, there is a third `hurdle`: Careers `rarely live up to` your childhood dreams.
如果你`能克服`这些`障碍`，还有第三道：职业`很少能达到`你童年梦想的期望。

In one study, looking for the ideal job left college seniors feeling more `anxious, stressed, overwhelmed and depressed` throughout the process — and less satisfied with the outcome. As Tim Urban writes, `happiness is reality minus expectations`. If you’re looking for `bliss`, you’re `bound to` be disappointed. 
在一项研究中，寻找理想工作让高年级大学生在整个过程中感到更加`焦虑、压抑、无力和沮丧`—并对结果更加不满。如蒂姆·厄本(Tim Urban)所写，`幸福等于现实状况减去期望值`。如果你寻找的是`狂喜`，那么你`注定`会失望。

The `upside` of low expectations is that they `erase the gap` between what we wanted and what we got. `Extensive evidence` shows that instead of `painting a rosy picture` of a job, `you’re better off going in` with a realistic preview of what it’s really like, `warts and all`.
低期望值的一个`好处`是，它们能`消弭`我们所想与所得之间的差距。`大量证据`表明，与其把一份工作想象得很美好，还不如在入职时贴合实际地预想一下它真实的样子，并且`毫无保留`。

I’m all for encouraging youngsters to `aim high and dream big`. 
我完全支持年轻人`力争上游、志存高远`。

Mr. Pillsbury said he took that to imply that his visa application had been `stymied` in `reprisal` for the new restrictions.
白邦瑞说，他把该官员的意思理解为，他的签证申请`受阻`是对这些新限制的`报复`。

He used a `Chinese idiom` to `characterize` the move: killing a chicken to scare the monkeys, which means sending a warning by making someone an example.
他用了一个`中国成语`来`形容`这种报复：杀鸡儆猴，意思是惩罚某人以警戒他人。

F.B.I. had `rescinded` or put on review the visas of as many as 30 Chinese scholars who visit the United States, reflecting `growing concern` about Chinese intelligence-gathering.
FBI`吊销`了或重新审查了多达30名来美国访问的中国学者的签证，反映出政府对中国情报收集活动的`担忧日益加剧`。

Some people in China have their own label for the `polarizing` American president: savior.
对于这位让公众意见`两极分化的`美国总统，中国一些人有自己的标签：救世主。

At dinner tables, in social media chats and in `discreet conversations`, some of the country’s `intellectual` and business elite are `half-jokingly, half-seriously` cheering on the leader
在餐桌上、在社交媒体聊天时、在`谨慎的交谈`中，中国一些`知识分子`和商界精英`半开玩笑半认真地`为这位领导人喝彩

The chances that Mr. Trump alone can change China's ways are `exceedingly slim`.
单凭特朗普一人改变中国行事方式的几率`极其渺茫`。

“There’s only `a pool of stagnant water`.”
“只有一潭死水。”

leadership has `embraced` some `modest liberalization`. The government has promised to cut taxes, `ease other burdens` on the private sector and give markets `a somewhat bigger role` in the economy.
领导层已经接受了某种`适度的自由化`。政府已承诺减税、减轻民营部门负担，并让市场在经济中发挥更大作用。

But there’s little evidence that the leadership is `easing its grip in a lasting way`. The few `business-friendly gestures` are `reactive rather than proactive`. 
但鲜有证据表明，中国的领导层正在`以持久的方式放松管控`。为数不多的企业友好表态是`应对之举，而不是主动求变`。

There is a `caveat`: The signs of improvement most likely do not `stem from` a sudden burst of confidence in the strength of the country’s economy among Chinese business leaders.
但需要`警告`的是：经济好转的迹象很可能并非`源自`中国商界领袖对中国经济实力的信心突然爆发。

Richard searched the taxi and then the park, `scouring around the gardens`, the playgrounds and `a bronze statue of Peter Pan`
理查德先在出租车里搜寻，然后进了公园，在花园、游乐场和彼得·潘的铜像周围寻找

Richard Chow `discovered his younger brother’s taxi abandoned outside` Carl Schurz Park, a 15-acre Manhattan `oasis overlooking the East River`. He `began to panic`
理查德·周发现弟弟的出租车被遗弃在俯瞰东河的15英亩曼哈顿绿洲——卡尔·舒尔茨公园外。他开始紧张起来

For months, he had watched his brother and fellow `cabdriver`, Kenny, `struggle under enormous debt`. Kenny had `grown distant and despondent`
几个月来，他眼睁睁地看着弟弟、出租车司机肯尼(Kenny)为巨额债务而挣扎。肯尼变得疏远和沮丧

Taxi industry leaders `artificially inflated medallion prices` and `channeled purchasers into exploitative loans` that they could not afford. 
出租车行业领导者人为地抬高了勋章的价格，并且引导购买者背上无力偿还的剥削性贷款

`The medallion bubble began to collapse` in late 2014. `Prices plummeted`. But the drivers `remained stuck with massive loans`
勋章泡沫在2014年底开始破裂，价格暴跌。但这些司机仍然背负着巨额贷款

Richard had `looked after` Kenny their entire lives. His first memory was of a soccer game when his brother `got into an argument` and he `intervened to` protect him from `getting beat up`
理查德毕生都在照顾肯尼。他最早的记忆是一场足球赛，当时弟弟卷入争吵，他上去干预，让弟弟免遭毒打

The brothers got jobs at the same factory, `dyeing wool for sweaters.`
兄弟俩进入同一家毛衣用羊毛印染厂工作 

They saved most of their earnings, but `occasionally they splurged on a trip to` the movies to see the latest American `action film`
他们把大部分收入存起来，不过偶尔也会挥霍一下，去看最新的美国动作片

They began as `restaurant deliverymen`, `fighting the rain and snow to` deliver Chinese food. Then they joined the jewelry business, as `diamond setters`
他们一开始给饭店当送餐员，冒着雨雪送中餐。然后他们进入珠宝行业，做钻石镶嵌

By then, medallion prices were `skyrocketing`. Large fleet owners like Freidman were `intentionally overpaying` for medallions to increase the value of their portfolios. 
那时，执照勋章价格飞涨。像弗莱德曼这样的大出租车公司老板为增加自己投资组合的价值，故意炒高勋章的价格

Lenders were `issuing reckless loans`, and as in the housing bubble, the easy money inflated prices more
放贷人不计后果地发放贷款，就像在房地产泡沫时一样，宽松的贷款使得价格进一步膨胀

The younger brother could not `secure a conventional loan`. But he later told friends that a broker helped him to `leverage the equity in his house for a down payment` to make it work.
无法获得常规贷款。但他后来告诉朋友，一位经纪人帮他做房产抵押贷款付了首期，解决了这个问题

After his loan `hit the four-year mark`, when he was supposed to `repay everything`
当贷款达到了四年期限，他应该偿还所有债务时

In the fall of 2017, the family `received another blow`. Doctors diagnosed Kenny’s wife with `Stage 4 colon cancer`
2017年秋天，这个家庭又遭受了一次打击。医生诊断肯尼的妻子患了4期结肠癌

But he `fell far behind on his mortgage` and other expenses. He also could no longer help pay his daughter’s `college tuition`, and she decided to `drop out` to help the family
但他难以支付抵押贷款和其他费用。他也无法再支付女儿的大学学费，于是女儿决定辍学帮助家庭

Richard `clung to hope`. He knew driving could be exhausting, so he thought his brother had `lain down and fallen into a deep slumber`. Or maybe he went on `a meditation retreat`, or on `a hunt for extra money`
理查德抱着一线希望。他知道开车很累，所以他以为弟弟只是躺下沉沉睡去了。或者去做冥想治疗了，又或者是去赚外快了

Someone `spotted a body` in the East River near the Brooklyn Bridge. At a vigil, Richard `could barely speak`
有人在布鲁克林大桥附近的东河边发现了一具尸体, 悼念仪式上的理查德几乎说不出话来

Because of the change listing Kenny’s wife as a co-debtor, she `inherited his loan` when he died. But it did not `torment her for long`. Their daughter, who did not `get entrapped in` the loan, has returned to college
由于合同变化，肯尼的妻子也被列为共同债务人，肯尼去世后，她继承了他的贷款。但这并没有令她痛苦很久。他们的女儿没有被这笔贷款所困，已经回到大学

It is impossible to know why anyone `takes his or her own life`. But friends believe Kenny `was overwhelmed by his loans` and by competition from `ride-hailing`. They do not think it was `a coincidence`
一个人自杀的原因可能永远无从得知。但朋友们认为，肯尼被贷款和网约车服务的竞争压垮了. 他们认为不是巧合

Taxi industry leaders `seized on the brothers’ story`. One group `tapped Richard to headline` an event
出租车行业的领导者们注意到这对兄弟的故事。一个组织让理查德在一个媒体活动中担任主角

We columnists imagine our articles `going viral, sweeping the world`, carried into `cabinet rooms`, changing history
我们专栏作家总是想象我们的文章能走红网络、席卷世界、被带进政府内阁、改变历史

This is my `annual list` of my columns that no one read. I’d say that they `bombed`, except that would `connote impact`. Let’s just call them `duds. Flops. Busts. Losers`
这里是我没人读的专栏的年度清单。我倒是想说这些文章是写砸了，但砸字还显得留下了点影响似的。权且称它们为废物,失策,水货,卢瑟

`Growing evidence` that hope is a critical factor in `overcoming poverty`
越来越多的证据表明，希望是战胜贫困的关键因素

`Invariably when` I give a talk at a university, someone will `lament` that more journalists don’t `cover humanitarian stories`

赵林已经习惯了单身生活。但是日复一日，他感到越来越孤独，决定是时候该找个伴了

`A fixture` at one of the dozens of `senior singles scenes popping up` in public parks around China. So far, he admits, `the pickings have been slim`
在中国各地的公园里，冒出很多单身老人相亲角，他是其中一个的常客。他承认，到目前为止，收获甚微

In Chinese media, the phenomenon has been labeled `“twilight love.”` `Contestants well into` their later years now make regular appearances on Chinese dating shows with names like “`Peach Blossoms Bloom`,” “`Exciting Old Friends`” and “`Holding Hands`.”
在中国的媒体上，这种现象被称为“黄昏恋”。在中国的相亲节目中，如《桃花朵朵开》、《精彩老朋友》和《牵手》，步入晚年的选手频频露面

It’s a practical way for `a group gathering`, In the park, you can `increase the chance of` having successful `blind dates`. `Demographics` is behind it all
这种聚会方式很实用，在公园里，你可以增加成功相亲的机会 这一切的背后是人口结构

`An aging population` means more people are `outliving their spouses`. 
人口老龄化意味着越来越多的人比配偶长寿 

The number of `widows and widowers` totals nearly 48 million, And `four out of five` widows and widowers want to remarry
寡妇和鳏夫加起来的总数接近4800万

`That lack of knowledge is understandable`. When China’s elders were young, talking about sex was `taboo`. People met their `prospective spouses` through friends or `matchmakers`. Dating was almost `unheard-of`
缺乏知识是可以理解的。中国的老年人在年轻时，性是不能谈论的禁忌。人们通过朋友或媒人认识未来的伴侣。约会几乎是闻所未闻

Minutes later, they `struck up a conversation`.
几分钟后，他们聊了起来

In China’s parks, that can make for `awkward scenes`. `A strip of greenery next to` the Forbidden City, elderly men `clustered together, scoping out` the women and men `milling around like wallflowers`
在中国的公园里，这可能会造成尴尬的场面。最近的一个周二，在紫禁城旁边绿树成荫的菖蒲河，老年男性们聚集在一起，仔细观察像壁花一样徜徉的男男女女

“Nowadays, many people are not `hygienic, dress poorly` and are not `imbued with sophistication and good breeding`,” he `sniffed`
“现在这人都不讲卫生，穿得很差，很没内在的修养，”他嗤之以鼻地说

Most of `the characters` here are pretty bad, At this stage, `love at first sight` is impossible. She was `pessimistic about her prospects`
大部分人品太差了 你说这岁数一见钟情，我觉得不可能  她对自己的前景感到悲观

He `bemoaned the directness` of some of the women, They ask you directly to change the names in `the property deed`
他感叹，有些女人太直接  来了就直接你把房本能改了吗？一见面就先提这个

But he still `longed for a mate` to `ward off his loneliness`
但他仍然渴望有个伴来排遣寂寞

If you’ve never `experienced` these three `big treasures`, how can you understand what is `bliss`? 
这三大宝，你不懂这三大宝，你怎么理解人生什么叫幸福，什么叫痛苦

This is what I’m feeling right now. But I never `used to feel like that`
我就现在特别感觉这样，我原来我没感觉到

During that time, I have seen interest in `high-intensity exercise` soar and enthusiasm for barefoot running fizzle. 
在这期间，我看到人们对高强度运动的兴趣高涨，对赤脚跑步的热情减退

We have learned `contracting muscles talk to baby neurons`, creativity `blooms` from walking, a minute of `exertion can be ample`, aging is elastic and `a chubby dog` may be our best exercise motivator
我们了解到，收缩肌肉可以影响婴儿的神经元，散步可以促进创造力，一分钟的锻炼是足够的，衰老是可以改善的，一只胖狗可能是最好的锻炼激励

Multiple studies and `subsequent columns reiterating` that `super-short, strenuous workouts` — known as high-intensity interval training — improve fitness and health to about the `same extent as much longer, more moderate exercise`
多项研究和随后的专栏文章都不断重申，这种超短、高强度的锻炼，和时间长很多且较和缓的锻炼比起来，对体能和健康的改善效果是差不多的

`In what may be`, for me, the most inspiring area of `fitness research` from the past decade, scientists have `found and reaffirmed the extent` to which movement, of almost any kind and amount, may `remake how we think and feel`
对我来说，过去十年的健身研究可能是最鼓舞人心的领域，科学家们发现并一再确认，几乎任何种类和数量的运动都可能在很大程度上重塑我们的思维和感觉

Exercise also seems able to `buoy moods far more than most of us`, including scientists, might have expected 10 years ago
锻炼对情绪的提振效果似乎远远超出我们大多数人——包括科学家——在10年前的估计

Walking, jogging, `gardening, weight training`, swimming, biking, hiking or even rising from an office or living room chair often and `strolling across` the room seemed to make people happier and `less prone to mood problems than remaining still`
散步、慢跑、园艺、举重、游泳、骑车、徒步旅行，甚至经常从办公室或客厅的椅子上站起来，在房间里散步，似乎都比静止更能让人快乐，更不易出现情绪问题

People who exercise `harbor different types and amounts` of proteins in their `bloodstreams`, for instance, even if they have not been `working out recently`, and these `patterns of proteins` may play a role in reducing risks for `metabolic problems` such as diabetes or heart disease
例如，经常运动者的血液中含有不同类型和数量的蛋白质，即使他们近期内没有健身，这些蛋白质的模式依然可能在降低糖尿病或心脏病等代谢问题风险中发挥作用

whether those needs differ as we age or if wish to `deploy exercise` to `fend off or treat specific conditions`, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or a family history of weight problems
如果需要通过锻炼来预防或治疗高血压、糖尿病或遗传体重问题等特定疾病，这个标准是否也应有所变化

`Renovated` five years ago at the government’s expense, the temple is used by a group of `retirees who run pilgrimages` to a holy mountain, schoolchildren who come to learn traditional culture and `a Taoist priest` who `preaches to wealthy urbanites` about the traditional values of ancient China
五年前，政府出资对这座寺庙进行了翻新，现在一群退休人士前往这里朝拜圣山，学童来此地学习传统文化，一位道士在这里宣讲中国古代传统价值观

In the northern suburbs of this city is a small temple to a Chinese `folk deity, Lord Guan`, a famous warrior `deified more than a millennium ago`
在这座城市的北郊有一座小寺庙，供奉的是一位中国民间的神祇——关公，他是1000多年前一位被神化的著名武士

`Perched atop` a hillock `overlooking the sprawling capital`, the temple is `a microcosm` of a new civil religion taking shape in China
寺庙坐落在一座小山上，俯瞰着地域辽阔的都城，它是中国正在形成的一种新的民间宗教的缩影

Most Chinese believe in `an amalgam of Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism` and other traditional values and ideas that still `resonate deeply`
大多数中国人信奉的是一种融合了佛教、道教、儒教以及其他仍然能够引起强烈共鸣的传统价值观和思想的混合体

`From the 19th century onward`, China’s elites argued that the country’s traditions and faiths were `a major reason for its decline`
自19世纪以降，中国的精英阶层就认为，它的传统与信仰是其衰落的主因

The plan `stems from a widespread feeling` that China’s `relentless drive to get ahead economically` has created `a spiritual vacuum`, and sometimes `justifies breaking rules` and `trampling civility`. 
这项计划源于人们普遍的感受：中国追求经济发展的不懈欲望造成了精神上的真空，有时还导致明目张胆地破坏规则和践踏文明。

Many people do not trust one another. The government’s `blueprint for handling this moral crisis` calls for `endorsing certain traditional beliefs.`
人与人之间缺乏互信。政府为应对这一道德危机制定蓝图，呼吁人们认可某些传统信仰

The men and women `sat around` a big wooden table, `wielding brushes to write out`, over and over again, his most `famous phrase: “zhi xing he yi” (knowledge and action are one)`. This knowledge, according to Wang, `comes from an inner light, a conscience`
这些男男女女围坐在一张大木桌旁，挥舞毛笔，一遍又一遍地写下他最著名的格言：“知行合一”  根据他的说法，这种认知源于一种内心的指引，一种良知

The plan orders to `promote “ancient and worthy sages,”` as well as to `“deeply expound”` traditional concepts such as “ren’ai” (`benevolence`), “zhengyi” (`righteousness`) and “jianyi zhengwei” (`standing up bravely for the truth`)
这份新计划要求推广“古圣先贤”，并且对“仁爱”、“正义”、“见义勇为”等传统观念进行“深入阐发”

He `parks in the same lot` where he’d take breaks and read his wife’s letters, sent from Montreal while they `courted by post` in the late 1970s. He `seats his regulars` at the same tables where his three daughters did homework
他的车泊在同一个停车场，小憩的时候，他曾在那里读未婚妻从蒙特利尔的来信，那是20世纪70年代末，他们还在远距离地谈恋爱。若是熟客上门，他会让他们坐在三个女儿曾经做作业的那张桌子

Their children, `educated and raised in America`, are `pursuing professional careers` that do not demand the same `grueling labor` as food service
他们的子女在美国长大，接受了高等教育，从事的职业不需要像食品服务业这样累人的劳动

It doesn’t seem that `interest in the cuisine has faltered`
人们对中餐的兴趣似乎并没有减退

But those are not Chinese-restaurant-specific factors, and do not explain `the wave of closings`. Instead, a big reason seems to be `the economic mobility` of the second generation
但这些都不是中餐馆特有的困难，无法解释中餐馆关闭的潮流。相反，一个很大的原因似乎是第二代华人的经济流动性

In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act `halted what had been a steady rise` in people coming from China. `It was not revoked until 1943`, and `large-scale immigration resumed` only after 1965, when other race-targeting `quotas were abolished`
1882年的《排华法案》阻止了中国移民的稳步增长。这个法案直到1943年才被撤销，其他针对族裔的配额在1965年被废除后，大规模的移民才得以恢复

An `often violent social and political upheaval` that started in 1966, `prompted many young people to emigrate` to the United States, a country that `projected an image of` freedom and economic possibility
这场充满暴力的社会和政治动荡促使许多年轻人逃离中国，移民到给人以自由和经济可能性印象的美国

He `hiked, climbed and swam his way to` Hong Kong, filling his pants with pine cones as `an improvised flotation device`
他一路翻山越岭，最后靠游泳来到香港，他在裤腿里塞满松果，权当漂浮装置

Although he had never worked in a restaurant, the heat from the woks `was much less intense` than what he experienced at a Hong Kong `plastics factory` where he had worked
尽管他从未在餐馆工作过，但炒菜锅的灼热远不及他在香港一家塑料厂工作时所经历的

They `served Hunan and Cantonese foods` on `linen tablecloths` to `bejeweled, curious diners` at places like Shun Lee Palace in New York
在纽约顺利宫餐馆这样的地方，他们烹饪的湘菜和粤菜能端上铺着亚麻桌布的餐桌，为佩戴珠宝的好奇食客享用

We started getting `regional practitioners of fine regional cuisine` to come to this country and `do their thing`
从那时开始，我们有了中国地方菜系的从业者来美国做他们的菜

`Mostly, though`, the `newly minted chefs` cooked quickly and cheaply. They `adapted their method of` cooking to American tastes, `developing dishes` like beef chow fun, fortune cookies and egg drop soup, often brought home in the signature `takeout containers`
不过，大多数情况下，新掌勺的厨师靠的是快速和价格便宜的烹饪。他们根据美国人的口味作出调整，推出了干炒牛河、幸运饼干和蛋花汤等菜肴，人们通常把这些菜装在中餐特有的外卖盒里带回家吃

They were not `precious`, These people did not `come to be chefs`; they came to be immigrants, and cooking was `the way they made a living`
这些菜不娇贵，这些人来美国不是为了当厨师, 他们是移民，烹饪只是他们谋生的方法

Other immigrant groups `follow a similar pattern`. With `social mobility and inclusion` in more `mainstream parts of the economy`, the children of immigrants `are less likely than` their parents to own their own businesses
其他移民群体也有类似的经历。移民子女因社会流动性和包容性进入更主流的经济领域后，他们拥有自己生意的可能性比父母的要低

`In some ways`, the children are `regaining the status` of the first generation that they have lost while migrating
从某种意义上来说，这些子女在恢复父母作为第一代移民在其间失去的地位

When they `do become entrepreneurs`, these children `tend to work` in industries like tech or consulting, `rather than in food service or nail salons`
如果他们成为了企业家的话，子女往往在技术或咨询等行业，而不是在食品服务或美甲沙龙工作

Some members of the second generation have also `chosen to take charge of` family restaurants. Nom Wah Tea Parlor, a New York `dim sum restaurant` that opened in 1920, has `stayed a family business`
第二代中的个别人还是选择了接管家庭餐馆。1920年开业的纽约早茶馆南华茶室一直是家庭生意

`Initially`, his parents `balked at his decision` As immigrants, it’s the only thing you can do; if it’s not restaurants, it’s `a laundromat`
起初，他的父母不赞成他的这个决定 作为移民，你只能干这行；如果不是开餐馆，就是自助洗衣店

`On any given night`, groups of guests wait for a table outside the Chinatown location `for up to an hour`, `huddled in the bend of` Doyers Street
每天晚上，成群结队的客人挤在坐落于宰也街拐角的这家唐人街本店门外，要等位一个小时才能吃上

`In a parallel effort`, the team behind Junzi Kitchen, `a fast-casual Chinese restaurant chain` based in New York, recently raised $5 million to research and buy places like Eng’s, `rebranding` them with Junzi’s `modern take on the cuisine`
还有另一种让中餐馆继续下去的努力，总部设在纽约的中式休闲快餐连锁店君子食堂(Junzi Kitchen)背后的团队最近筹集到了500万美元，用于研究和收购像Eng’s这样的餐馆，将它们重塑为“君子”品牌下的现代中餐馆

Ms. Sit `feels more ready to retire` than her husband. `Normally talkative`, he can `be evasive` whenever the family tries to bring up a successor
薛女士比丈夫更愿意退休。虽然他通常健谈，但每当家人试图提起餐馆继承人的话题是，他总是闪烁其词

“They’ll have to work hard,” she said, `her eyes sparkling as she teased her husband`. But she is proud of what he built
“他们一定要是像汤姆·薛那样努力干活的人，”神采飞扬地揶揄丈夫说.但她对丈夫的成就感到自豪

The `airstrip stretches like a scar through` what was once `unspoiled Cambodian jungle`
飞机跑道像一条伤疤，穿过这片曾经完好无损的柬埔寨丛林

When completed next year on `a remote stretch of shoreline`, Dara Sakor International Airport will `boast the longest runway` in Cambodia, complete with the kind of `tight turning bay` favored by fighter jet pilots
七星海国际机场地处一段偏远的海岸线上，明年完工后，它将拥有柬埔寨最长的跑道，有战斗机飞行员喜欢的那种急转弯区

But the scale of the land deal at Dara Sakor has `raised eyebrows`, especially since the portion of the project built so far is already `moldering in malarial jungle`
但七星海项目的土地交易规模已引起了人们的关注，特别是自从目前已建成的部分在这片疟疾肆虐的丛林中无人问津以来

The activity at Dara Sakor is `stirring fears` that Beijing plans to turn this small Southeast Asian nation into `a de facto military outpost`
七星海的活动正在引起担心，即北京打算把这个东南亚小国变成事实上的军事前哨

This will allow China to `project its air power` through the region, and it changes the whole game
这将使中国能够在该地区投射空中力量，也将改变整个游戏规则

As China `extends its might overseas`, it is `bumping up` against a `regional security umbrella` shaped by the United States decades ago
随着中国向海外扩张，它正在与美国几十年前形成的区域安全保护伞发生碰撞

But to win his place as Asia’s `longest-serving leader`, Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia `has turned his back on` free elections and rule of law
但柬埔寨首相洪森已背弃了自由选举和法治，成为亚洲任期最长的领导人

Dara Sakor’s runway and port will transform this `remote rainforest` into `a global logistics hub` that will “make miracles possible,” as Dara Sakor’s `promotional literature` puts it
七星海的跑道和港口将把这片偏远的雨林变成一个全球物流中心，正如七星海宣传资料所说的“让奇迹成为可能”

Other villagers who attended the meeting `confirmed his account`. Land officials wouldn’t comment.
参加了那个会的其他村民证实了他的说法。土地管理官员不予置评

The company `was exempted from` any `lease payments` for a decade
这家公司还在头10年内免交任何租金

Even with `generous lease terms`, the one part of Dara Sakor that has been built, `a resort complex`, is `languishing`. 
即使有慷慨的租赁条款，七星海已经落成的一个度假村看上去还是一片萧条。

On a recent day, `the golf course` was empty and `the casino deserted`. The `marina restaurant` attracted one Chinese family, which had brought seafood in `a plastic bag` to avoid paying resort prices
在不久前的一天，这里的高尔夫球场空无一人，赌场也空无一人。游艇停靠区的餐厅里只有一家中国人，他们用塑料袋自带海鲜，以免支付度假村高昂的价格

We `are frankly fed up`, Do we have to ask the United States to `develop our sovereignty`?
坦率地说，我们忍无可忍了，我们难道非得要美国来发展我们的主权吗？
