we have `an old saying`: “tian gao, huangdi yuan,” or, “the emperor is `as far away as the sky`.” We use it to `reassure` ourselves 
有句老话，叫“天高皇帝远”。我们用它来宽慰自己

a professor in international relations explained that Singapore was an `authoritarian state`, where the government `wielded tremendous control` over citizens’ daily lives.
一位国际关系教授解释说，新加坡是一个专制国家，政府对民众的日常生活指手画脚。

we could `follow the commentary` posted by `public intellectuals` there, so we `wouldn’t have to simply accept the government’s narrative`
可以在上面关注那些公共知识分子发表的评论，这样我们就不用只接受政府的一面之词

I `couldn’t wait to` go back home; I believed `it was poised to` become a place where idealists like me would `thrive`.
我迫不及待地想回家；我相信它会成为一个像我这样的理想主义者如鱼得水的地方

security checks `were instituted` in the subway system. We `grew used to` policemen checking people’s identity cards in interchange stations.
地铁系统增加了安检。慢慢地，我们习惯了警察在换乘站检查身份证。

a story that had `gone viral` in my WeChat `feeds overnight`: “A BBC reporter challenged China’s surveillance network ― and it took only seven minutes to capture him!” I couldn’t tell which terrified me more: China’s `all-encompassing network of facial recognition` surveillance cameras, or that my `countrymen` were proudly cheering them on.
看到一篇一夜走红的报道：“BBC记者挑战中国天网工程，潜逃七分钟后被抓获！”我说不出哪个更让我害怕：是中国无所不在的人脸识别监控摄像头网络，还是我的同胞们在骄傲地为它喝彩。

Entering train stations felt like crossing border control at an international airport ― my identity was not only confirmed by someone checking my documents, but also by one of the `ubiquitous facial recognition cameras`. 
进入火车站就像在国际机场通过边境管制一样――不仅有人检查我的文件并确认我的身份，无处不在的面部识别摄像头也在确认我的身份

Our `mind-set`, `long ago`, `was wired to` see safety and freedom as `an either-or choice`
长久以来，我们的思维定势是将安全和自由视为非此即彼的选择

As the United States and China `edge closer to` a trade agreement, the ability to reach a final deal is `coming down to` a central question: Will Beijing `live up to` its promises?
随着美国和中国距离一项贸易协议越来越近，最终达成协议将取决于一个核心问题：北京是否会兑现其承诺？

But it `remains unclear` which `provisions` of the trade deal will `be subject to enforcement` and how much power the United States will have to punish Beijing if it `reneges on` the agreement. The ability to `secure a firm commitment` from China to `hold up its end of the pact` or face repercussions will be a key determinant in whether President Trump’s trade deal is seen as a true win or a `capitulation`.
但目前尚不清楚贸易协议的哪些条款在这种执行的范围之内，以及如果北京违反协议，美国将拥有多大的惩罚权力。特朗普总统的贸易协议是被视为真正的胜利还是投降，关键决定因素将在于能否让中国明确承诺会履行协议，否则要面临报复。

China experts say enforcement is necessary `given that` the United States wants Beijing to `make significant structural changes` that will take time.
中国问题专家表示，鉴于美国希望北京做出的重大结构改革并非短时间内能完成，执行的机制是必要的

“I `remain very cautious on` this,” Mr. Allen said. “Will the Chinese really `renounce` the ability to `retaliate` at what they feel is an unfair trade action? I think it `defies` Chinese tradition.”
“我对此仍然非常谨慎，”艾伦说。“中国人真的会放弃报复的能力，哪怕看到他们认为不公平的贸易行为？我认为这不符合中国的一贯方式。”

Mr. Trump, who met with a Chinese delegation in the `Oval Office` last week, said negotiators might require four more weeks to finish `ironing out` the deal.
特朗普上周在椭圆形办公室会见了中国代表团，他表示谈判代表可能需要再过四周才能最终敲定协议。

I `remain confident` in the `prospects` of a deal, but I think we need to be `cleareyed` and understand that China could `walk away` from expected commitments in purchases, market access, intellectual property and other areas if they don’t get something out of this deal, and that’s `tariff relief`
我对交易的前景仍然充满信心，但我认为我们需要保持清醒的头脑，并且明白如果不能从协议中获得些什么，中国可能会放弃采购、市场准入、知识产权及其他方面预计会有的承诺，而他们想要的就是关税减免。

Far from `panicking` at his misfortune, he used his five months of severance pay to `hang out` for a few weeks with friends and `ponder` other career options
他非但没有对自己的厄运感到恐慌，反而用他拿到的五个月的遣散费和朋友们潇洒了几周，琢磨其他的职业选择

Yet as the Ford layoffs show, `economic warning signs` are starting to `emerge` in China. Inflation has `gradually crept up`. Economic growth has slowly `eroded`.
然而，如福特的裁员所显示的那样，经济预警信号已开始在中国出现。通货膨胀率已逐渐上升。经济增长则在慢慢减缓。

A huge `pedestrian plaza` in the Guanyinqiao neighborhood `pulses with` lights and crowds even on weekday nights. The trees are `illuminated with bright lanterns`.
观音桥附近的一个巨大的步行广场灯火通明，即使在工作日的晚上也是人潮涌动。树上挂着明亮的灯笼。

Under the ground `burrows` an extensive subway system. The monorail and subway were almost `entirely` built in the last 15 years.
城市的地下有一个巨大的地铁系统。单轨和地铁几乎都是在过去15年里建起来的。

Mr. Bo `ended up` sentenced to life in prison for bribetaking, `embezzlement` and abuse of power.
最终因受贿、贪污和滥用职权被判处无期徒刑。

From the Altai Mountains to the Pacific Coast, `logging` is `ravaging` Russia’s vast forests, leaving behind `swathes of scarred` earth `studded with dying stumps`.
从阿尔泰山脉到太平洋沿岸，砍伐正在毁坏俄罗斯广袤的森林，之后留下的，是伤痕累累的土地上遍布着的垂死树桩。

Since China began restricting commercial logging in its own natural forests two decades ago, it has `increasingly` turned to Russia, importing huge amounts of wood in 2017 to satisfy the `voracious appetite` of its construction companies and furniture manufacturers.
自二十年前开始限制本国天然森林的商业采伐以来，中国已日益将矛头转向俄罗斯，2017年进口了巨量木材，以满足其建筑公司和家具制造商的巨大需求。

Environmentalists say China has simply shifted the harm of `unbridled` logging from home to abroad, even as it `reaps` the economic benefits. Some warn that the scale of logging today could `deplete` what `unspoiled` forests remain, `contributing to` global warming.
环保主义者称，中国只是把肆无忌惮的采伐的危害从国内转移到了海外，甚至从中获得了经济利益。一些人士警告称，今天的伐木规模可能会耗尽未遭破坏的森林，从而加剧全球变暖。

It is one thing for Chinese demand to `overwhelm` small, poor nations desperate for cash, but it is another for it to `drain the resources` of a far larger country, one that regards itself as a superpower and a strategic partner to China.
中国的需求令急需现金的穷困小国无法招架是一回事，耗尽一个大国的资源就是另一回事了，而这个国家还将自己视为超级大国，以及中国的战略伙伴。

What we are doing now in Siberia and the Far East is destroying what is left of the original intact forest landscapes
我们眼下在西伯利亚和远东所做的事情正在把仅存的原始森林风景毁掉

The total value of China’s timber imports ― rough logs, timber or wood pulp ― has increased more than 10 times since China began restricting logging at home in 1998
1998年中国开始限制国内伐木以来，中国的木材进口总价值――粗原木、木材或木浆――增长了10倍以上

In many rural areas of the Russian Far East and Siberia, there are few other ways to make money, or to make a living, than stripping natural resources of the vast surrounding forests
在俄罗斯远东和西伯利亚的许多农村地区，除了剥夺周围大片森林的自然资源，几乎没有其他赚钱或谋生的方式

When pressed, she declined to discuss her concessions in detail, but according to the company’s website, she had invested $20 million in Russia by 2015
在被追问时，她拒绝谈论自己的特许权的详情，但该公司网站显示，截至2015年，她已在俄罗斯投资了2000万美元

The business can be quite profitable, especially when Bitcoin prices are soaring, but the process requires considerable amounts of electricity.
这项业务非常有利可图，特别是在比特币价格飙升的时候，但这个过程需要耗费大量电力

At one point, China accounted for roughly two-thirds of all Bitcoin produced.
中国一度占到比特币总算力的三分之二左右。

But China keeps a tight grip over how much money flows in and out of its borders, and cryptocurrencies ― which are traded on decentralized computer networks and allow people to make transactions anonymously ― threatened to undermine those capital controls.
但中国严格控制资金的进出，而加密货币在分散的计算机网络上交易，并允许人们匿名交易，这就有可能破坏它对资本的管制。

The Chinese authorities began to ratchet up pressure on Bitcoin miners.
中国当局开始对比特币矿工施压

Just since 1990, the mortality rate for children under 5 has fallen in China by 83 percent ― suggesting, by my calculations, that an additional 676,000 Chinese children survive each year who previously would have died.
自1990年以来，中国五岁以下儿童死亡率下降了83%――根据我的计算，这意味着中国每年新增67.6万名儿童存活下来，在此之前他们可能死亡。

I used to believe that China was best approached with ambivalence, but in the last few years the ambivalence has faded into wariness.
我曾经认为，与中国打交道最好是带着点矛盾心理，但在最近几年，这种矛盾已逐渐演变成警惕。

First, to the extent possible, we should try to curb Chinese high-technology firms’ access to Western markets. These businesses are a security threat, and the Trump administration is right to be concerned. If a company like Huawei is asked to cooperate with Chinese State Security spies, its executives simply can’t say no.
首先，我们应该尽可能地限制中国高科技公司进入西方市场。这些企业是安全威胁，特朗普政府有理由感到担忧。如果像华为这样的公司被要求与中国国家安全间谍合作，它的高管们肯定不会说不。

China purchased a Boeing 767 in 2000 to be its presidential jet and it arrived riddled with listening devices. China inevitably will try to do to us what we already did to it.
2000年，中国购买了一架波音767飞机作为其领导人专机，飞机交付时安装了许多监听设备。中国将会试图对我们做的事情，我们也做过，这是不可避免的。

A few days ago, China announced that it would soon ban all variants of fentanyl, a welcome step that may make a difference. But China often promises cooperation that does not materialize, and everything will depend on enforcement over the country’s 160,000 chemical companies. Too many lives hang in the balance to take China at its word.
几天前，中国宣布将很快禁止所有种类的芬太尼，这是一个令人欣喜的举措，可能会产生效果。但中国承诺的合作经常得不到实现，一切将取决于对中国16万家化工企业的执法。这关系到太多生命，不能只听中国嘴上说说就当真。

Neighbors become informants. Children are interrogated. Mosques are monitored.
邻居成为告密者。儿童遭到审问。清真寺被监控。

Muslim minorities line up, stone-faced, to swipe their official identity cards. At big checkpoints, they lift their chins while a machine takes their photos, and wait to be notified if they can go on.
少数民族穆斯林面无表情地排队刷身份证。大型岗哨会有机器给他们拍照，他们抬起下巴，等待放行通知。

The extra money is not coming from Juilliard. The local government is footing the bill. And that could become a problem for officials struggling with debt after an epic spending spree to develop a new commercial center from scratch.
额外的钱不是由茱莉亚学院出资，而是由当地政府埋单。对已经在大举花钱从无到有建起一座商业中心的政府而言，这可能会成为问题。

Four-fifths of the office space stands empty. Construction on other buildings has stopped, leaving skeletons in the sky. A sprawling mall has few shoppers. 
其中五分之四的办公空间是空的。其他建筑物的建设已经停止，只留下高耸的骨架。一个庞大的购物中心几乎没有顾客。

Chinese local governments are swimming in debt. By official accounts, that debt totals $4.5 trillion. By unofficial estimates, it could be as large as $10 trillion. No one knows for sure because much of the borrowing for projects like the Tianjin Juilliard campus is rarely disclosed.
中国地方政府债台高筑。据官方统计，债务总额为4.5万亿美元。据非官方估计，这一数字可能高达10万亿美元。没有人确切知道，因为像天津茱莉亚音乐学院这种项目的贷款很少被披露。

But China is not growing as fast as it used to, and it is not clear that the “build it and they will come” model will save Yujiapu and other places with big debts. The national government now must find other ways to spur growth ― without making the debt problem worse.
但中国的经济增长速度已不如从前，“只要盖好了，一切都会来”的模式能否拯救于家堡等债台高筑的地方，目前还不清楚。国家政府现在必须找到其他方法来刺激经济增长――同时不让债务问题更加恶化。

If Yujiapu really is the Manhattan of China, it has a way to go to catch up to the real thing. Its avenues, some nearly as wide as Broadway, are eerily quiet.
如果于家堡真是中国的曼哈顿，那它还有很长的路要走。它的街道有些几乎和百老汇一样宽，但是出奇的安静

If the political will collapses for the Binhai area, then the bank loans will begin to dry up and the whole area is in trouble
如果滨海新区的政治意志崩溃，那么银行贷款将开始枯竭，整个地区都会陷入困境

Many residents believe Yujiapu’s problems have been overstated and try to cast its emptiness in a positive light
许多居民认为于家堡的问题被夸大了，并试图从正面看待空置现象

“Now, there are `quite a lot of` internet companies, including some e-commerce platforms,” he said, `speculating` that these companies could move into his building in the future.
“现在你看互联网公司就比较多了，包括一些电商平台，”他说，他`猜测`这些公司将来会搬进他所在的大楼。

Just as he had on previous trips, Zhu Feng bolted down his lunch at the Los Angeles airport before sprinting to catch his Air China flight back to Beijing.
和前几次旅行时一样，朱峰在洛杉矶机场匆匆吃完午餐后，跑去赶中国国际航空公司的航班回北京。

They flipped to the well-used 10-year visa to the United States and crossed out the page with a black pen.
他们翻到已经用过多次的来美10年签证那页，用一支黑笔在上面打了个大叉。

Now, that door appears to be closing, with the two nations ramping up their strategic rivalry and each regarding academic visitors from the other with greater suspicion ― of espionage, commercial theft and political meddling.
现在，这扇门似乎正在关闭，两国之间的战略竞争日益加剧，彼此都对对方的学术访问者有更大的怀疑，怀疑他们从事间谍活动、商业盗窃和政治干预。

“These people are among the most sophisticated in how the U.S. works and are some of the strongest advocates of good relations with the United States,”
We are alienating some of America’s best friends in China.”
“这些人中有些是最了解美国如何运作的人，也是最强烈主张与美国保持良好关系的人，我们正在疏远美国在中国的一些最好的朋友。”

A driving rain lashed the hills while the premier was there on Thursday.
在总理到访的周二，山上下起了暴雨。

The reassuring language was part of a broader effort to convince increasingly skeptical European nations that China comes in peace.
此种安抚性的表述属于一项总体行动的一部分，其目标是让日益持怀疑态度的欧洲国家确信，中国没有恶意。

The thickening ranks of China’s economic allies have left European officials increasingly wary. Last month, Italy formally signed on to China’s vast ‘‘One Belt, One Road’’ project, new Silk Road into Europe. On Friday, the summit meeting was capped by Greece’s announcement that it had joined, too.
中国经济盟友队伍的扩大使欧洲官员越来越警惕。上月，意大利正式加入中国庞大的“一带一路”项目，即进入欧洲的新丝绸之路。在周五的峰会上，希腊也宣布加入。

That does not mean that all is roses even between China and its newly forged economic allies in the group. But by aggressively courting the nations on Europe’s eastern and southern flank, Western officials worry that China is stoking division within the European Union.
这并不意味着一团和气，即便在中国和集团内的新经济盟友之间都谈不上。但是，如此大举拉拢欧洲东部和南部侧翼的国家，令西方官员担心中国正在加剧欧盟内部的分裂。

“I think that the fact that today we became 17 plus one is the good news of the day,” Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tspiras said on Friday. “I look forward to working with all of you in the framework of this initiative in full respect of the rules and procedures of the European Union.”
“我认为，今天我们成为17+1这一事实是重大利好，”希腊总理亚历克西斯・齐普拉斯(Alexis Tspiras)周五表示。“我期待在充分尊重欧盟规则和程序的情况下，在这项倡议的框架内与大家合作。”

China’s presence is no longer a novelty in this part of Europe, where its track record is decidedly more complicated than it was when the economic bloc was formed.
在欧洲的这一区域，中国的存在已经不是新鲜事，但此时中国的过往表现无疑要比经济集团形成时更复杂。

Similarly, the Czech Republic, led by the avowed Sinophile President Milos Zeman, has traditionally been among Europe’s most solicitous nations. But calls by its cybersecurity agency to limit the use of Huawei as well as the tech giant ZTE in critical infrastructure have infuriated Beijing.
捷克共和国在公开表示亲华的总统米洛什・泽曼(Milos Zeman)领导下，历来是对中国最热情的欧洲国家之一。但其网络安全机构同样要求限制华为和科技巨头中兴在关键基础设施中的使用，令北京大为光火。

In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban declared his China friendly ‘‘Opening to the East’’ policy in 2010, and has sought to use the prospect of a flood of money from China as leverage in his ongoing battles with Brussels over his government’s authoritarian drift. Yet there have been no major new Chinese investments for the past seven years.
在匈牙利，总理欧尔班・维克托(Viktor Orban)2010年宣布了对中国友好的“向东开放”政策，并在同欧盟就其政府的威权主义倾向展开的持续斗争中，利用中国资金大量涌入的前景为筹码。然而，在过去七年里，中国没有进行任何重大的新投资。

“Instead of engaging endlessly with China and pleading for it to change its ways,” said Fran?ois Godement, a senior adviser for Asia at the Institut Montaigne in Paris, “the Commission suggests that Europe should change track and adopt a set of robust defensive policies, some of which will have an effect whatever China’s response may be.”
“与其无休止地与中国接触，恳求中国改变它的方式，”巴黎蒙田研究所的资深亚洲问题专家顾德明(Fran?ois Godement)说，“欧盟委员会建议，欧洲应该改变方向，采用一套坚定的防御政策，其中一些无论中国作出什么反应都会起作用。”

Now, China has agreed to cut the price tag on the project by one-third to $11 billion, in a tacit acknowledgment that the economics of the original deal did not make financial sense.
现在，中国已同意将该项目的价格降低三分之一，减为110亿美元，默认了原来的协议在经济上行不通。

the program provided a way to use the country’s economic clout to build trade ties and win friends across Asia, Africa and Europe
该项目为利用中国的经济影响力建立贸易联系，在亚洲、非洲和欧洲广交朋友提供了一条途径。

As the new government began to pare back the debt, Mr. Mahathir announced that the administration would halt the East Coast Rail Link project and the gas pipeline deal, citing the high costs.
随着新政府开始削减债务，马哈蒂尔宣布，由于成本高昂，政府将暂停东海岸铁路线项目和天然气管道交易。

The shaky video clips of Julian Assange’s arrest flashed around the world Thursday, the white-bearded prophet of the age of leaks being hauled by unsmiling security officers to a gray van marked Police.
朱利安・阿桑奇(Julian Assange)周四被捕的场面被晃动的视频捕捉下来，迅速在全球范围内传播。这位蓄着白胡子的泄密时代先知，被面无笑容的安保人员拖上了一辆带有“警察”字样的灰色面包车。

It was also the latest ― and surely not the last ― dramatic turn in a career marked by both brilliant achievement and dubious judgment. Assange has long had a knack for celebrity, and as a tech-savvy, global, almost stateless figure, he captured the new influence the internet could give to individual citizens.
这也是他职业生涯中最新的――当然也不会是最后一次――戏剧性转折，这段生涯既有辉煌的成就，也有令人起疑的判断。长期以来，阿桑奇深谙成名之道。作为一个精通技术、四海为家、几乎没有国籍的人物，他抓住了互联网可能给个体民众带来的新影响力。

But Assange has always elicited fervent reactions: He has been hailed as a hero of free information, or despised as a treacherous criminal worthy of death by drone
但阿桑奇总是引发强烈的反应：他或者被誉为公开信息的英雄；或者被鄙视为一个变节的罪犯，应该被无人机处死

Assange, the world’s most famous self-proclaimed political refugee, lived there with his cat in a small corner room
作为世界上最著名的自封政治难民，阿桑奇和他的猫住在位于一个角落的小房间里

His words were a harbinger of the single charge of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion against Assange that the Justice Department unsealed Thursday.
他的话预示了美国司法部周四公布的一项对阿桑奇密谋实施电脑入侵的指控。

In some ways, Assange, 47, has never fully shed the rebellious, secretive ways of the precocious Australian teenager with a complicated family background who, with two pals, formed a hacking collective called the International Subversives.
在某些方面，现年47岁的阿桑奇从未完全摆脱那个早熟的澳大利亚少年叛逆、隐秘的生活方式。他有着复杂的家庭背景，少年时曾与两个朋友组成一个名为“国际颠覆者”(International Subversives)的黑客组织。

By 2006, when he founded WikiLeaks, Assange had adopted a nomadic lifestyle, roaming the world and pronouncing sometimes cryptic principles about secrecy and information
到2006年创建维基解密时，阿桑奇已经开始过着四处流浪的生活，在世界各地漫游，有时还宣布一些语焉不详的保密和信息原则。

Bored and harboring doubts about the war and American foreign policy, she began copying thousands of documents from a classified network onto CDs that she marked as Lady Gaga songs to avoid detection.
出于对战争和美国外交政策的厌倦和疑虑，她把一个机密网络中的数千份文件复制到光盘上，并将其标记为Lady Gaga的歌曲，以免被发现。

The War Logs, as they were called, were published in coordination with Le Monde, The Guardian and Der Spiegel, and they shed new light on civilian casualties, soldiers’ morale, the treatment of detainees and the use of contractors. 
这些被他们称为“战争日志”的文件是与《世界报》(Le Monde)、《卫报》(Guardian)和《明镜周刊》(Der Spiegel)合作发布的，让人们对平民伤亡、士兵士气、被拘押者的待遇以及承包商的使用有了新的了解。

An editor’s note explained that they provided “a real-time history of the war,” but also struck an ambivalent chord about their source, WikiLeaks, which the note said “was not involved in the news organizations’ research, reporting, analysis and writing.”
一份编辑手记解释说，它们提供了“战争的实时历史”；但同时对它们的来源维基解密表示出矛盾心态，该手记中写道，维基解密“没有参与新闻机构的研究、报道、分析和写作”。

When the diplomatic cables were published, The Times and other news organizations worked closely with WikiLeaks to redact names to protect vulnerable people ― but later, in a dispute with a British editor, Assange decided simply to publish the massive cable collection without any edits.
公布外交电报时，时报和其他新闻机构曾与维基解密密切合作，对人名进行涂黑，以保护会面临危险的人――但后来在与一名英国编辑发生争执后，阿桑奇决定不做任何编辑，直接公布大量电文。

Meanwhile, WikiLeaks was plagued with infighting, often touched off by Assange’s astringent style and ego. Two women complained to Swedish authorities about Assange’s sexual conduct with them, setting off a yearslong quest of investigators to question him.
与此同时，维基解密被内斗所困扰，它们往往是由阿桑奇的尖刻风格和自负引发的。两名女性就阿桑奇与她们的性行为向瑞典当局报案，引发了调查人员对他长达一年的问讯。

In 2012, Ecuador’s foreign minister announced that Assange was at the embassy in London and had asked for political asylum. Small as they were, Assange’s quarters there did not cramp his desire to remain in the limelight. 
2012年，厄瓜多尔外交部长宣布阿桑奇在该国驻伦敦大使馆，并且申请了政治庇护。他在那里的住所很小，但这并没有打击他继续待在风口浪尖的愿望。

Eventually, Assange’s isolation began to wear on him, He was becoming deeply depressed and wondered about simply walking out, the friend said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. And relations with his hosts were becoming deeply strained, even adversarial, as diplomats grew tired of his behavior. Even Assange’s friends called him difficult, a narcissist with an outsize view of his importance and little interest in mundane matters like hygiene.
他终于开始感到孤立无援,这位不愿透露姓名的朋友说，他变得非常沮丧，想着要不要干脆直接走出去。随着外交官们对他的行为日益厌倦，他与收留他的人的关系变得非常紧张，甚至有敌意。连阿桑奇的朋友也称他很难相处，说他非常自恋，把自己看得过于重要，对清洁卫生等琐事没什么兴趣。

Appearing in the Westminster Magistrates’ Court, his silver hair tied in a bun, Assange looked composed in a navy suit. The scene underscored the obvious: that Assange will use his legal predicament as a new platform for his defiance of authority and his crusade for WikiLeaks.
将一头银发盘成髻的阿桑奇出现在威斯敏斯特地方法院，身着深蓝色西装，看上去泰然自若。这一幕表明，阿桑奇显然将利用他的法律困境作为一个新的平台，挑战权威，为维基解密而战。

A six-month investigation by The New York Times covering three continents and including more than 150 interviews has described how Mr. Murdoch and his feuding sons turned their media outlets into right-wing political influence machines that have destabilized democracy in North America, Europe and Australia.
《纽约时报》进行了为期六个月的调查，覆盖三大洲、包括超过150次采访。透过调查可以看到，默多克与几个长期不和的儿子如何将他们的媒体机构转变为右翼政治影响力机器，并破坏北美、欧洲和澳大利亚的民主。

Here are some key takeaways from The Times’s investigation into the Murdoch family and its role in the illiberal, right-wing political wave sweeping the globe.
以下是《纽约时报》对默多克家族调查中的一些要点，其中涉及该家族在席卷全球的反自由主义、右翼政治浪潮中发挥的作用。

Fox News has long exerted a gravitational pull on the Republican Party in the United States, where it most recently amplified the nativist revolt that has fueled the rise of the far right and the election of President Trump.
长期以来，福克斯新闻一直对美国共和党施加压力，后者近年放大了本土主义的反抗，进而推动极右翼势力的崛起和特朗普总统的当选。

Mr. Murdoch’s newspaper The Sun spent years demonizing the European Union to its readers in Britain, where it helped lead the Brexit campaign that persuaded a slim majority of voters in a 2016 referendum to endorse pulling out of the bloc. Political havoc has reigned in Britain ever since.
默多克手下的报纸《太阳报》(The Sun)多年来一直向英国读者呈现一个被妖魔化的欧盟，成为引领脱欧运动、在2016年公投中说服超过半数选民支持退出欧盟的势力之一。自那以后，英国一直深陷政治混乱。

At the center of this upheaval sits the Murdoch family, a clan whose dysfunction has both shaped and mirrored the global tumult of recent years.
默多克家族位于这一动荡局面的中心，这个家族本身的紊乱塑造和映照了近年来的全球骚动。

His two sons are very different people. James wanted the company to become more digitally focused and more politically moderate, while Lachlan wanted to lean into the reactionary politics of the moment.
他的两个儿子是截然不同的人。詹姆斯希望公司变得更加注重数字化、在政治上更温和，而拉克兰则希望能够趋近当下的反动政治。

James briefly quit the company in protest. But he was lured back by a carefully crafted compromise that put Lachlan in charge but allowed James to save face by maintaining the public illusion that he was the heir.
詹姆斯很快退出了公司以示抗议。但又被一个精心设计的妥协诱引回来，即让拉克兰掌权，但让詹姆斯对外保持他是继承人的错觉，以帮他挽回面子

But all of these succession plans ― as well as the lucrative Disney deal ― were thrown into chaos last year when Mr. Murdoch broke his spine and collapsed on a yacht.
但所有这些继任计划――以及获利丰厚的迪士尼交易――去年都陷入了混乱，当时默多克摔断了脊椎，瘫倒在了一艘游艇上。

The Murdoch empire has also boldly flexed its muscles in Australia, which was for many years Lachlan’s domain.
默多克帝国还在澳大利亚大举展示自己的力量，那里多年来是拉克兰的领地。

In Australia, Lachlan expressed disdain for efforts to fight climate change and once rebuked the staff at one of his family’s newspapers,
在澳大利亚，拉克兰表达了对抗击气候变化相关努力的蔑视，并曾因一则支持同性婚姻的社论，斥责过他的家族报纸《澳大利亚人》(The Australian)的员工

They quickly introduced a slate of right-wing opinion shows that often focused on race, immigration and climate change.
他们迅速推介了一系列右翼观点节目，通常聚焦种族、移民和气候变化。

James wanted to revamp the network as a less partisan news outlet. He even floated the idea of hiring David Rhodes, a CBS executive.
当时，詹姆斯希望将福克斯新闻网改造成一个党派色彩不那么浓厚的新闻机构。他甚至提出了雇用CBS高管戴维・罗兹(David Rhodes)的想法。

His proposals went nowhere. Lachlan and Rupert opposed any change to what they saw as a winning formula and decided to stick with Fox’s incendiary programming.
他的提议未能得到采纳。拉克兰和鲁珀特不同意对他们心目中的成功方案做出任何改变，并决定坚持福克斯的煽动性节目。

But James believed he had seen firsthand the damage that outlets like Fox News were doing to the company.
但詹姆斯相信，他目睹了福克斯新闻等媒体对公司造成的损害。

When did leggings make the leap from garment to cultural lightning rod? For what are essentially stretchy footless tights in a seemingly endless array of patterns and colors, they have been an unexpected source of controversy.
从什么时候开始，紧身裤从一种服装变成了文化上的众矢之的？这种带有无数图案与颜色的弹力不连袜紧身裤成了意想不到的争议之源。

As a result, what the leggings uproar may have exposed is not so much anyone’s physique per se, but rather a cultural fault line that runs through generations. 
因此，紧身裤风波所暴露的，与其说是什么人的身材，还不如说是贯穿几代人的文化断层。

Sure, it’s possible that is overstating the matter. It’s possible they are just stretchy footless tights that are easy to wear.
当然，这有可能夸大了事实。它很可能仅仅是一种容易穿上身的不连袜弹力紧身裤。

But judging by Lululemon’s recent results, which saw net revenue rise 21 percent in the third quarter of 2018, and the fact that part of Levi’s much-heralded IPO was attributed to the “stretch” now included in jeans to cater to the leggings market, this “popular clothing choice” (as The Observer labeled them) is not going away any time soon. All this suggests that the Notre Dame uproar may not be a fluke, but a harbinger.
但请看Lululemon近期的销售结果，该品牌在2018年第三季度净营收增长21%；事实上，李维斯(Levi’s)新一轮大肆宣传的IPO部分是为迎合紧身裤市场而为牛仔裤加入的“拉伸”元素所带来的，因此这种“流行着装选择”（这是《观察者》为紧身裤打上的标签）在短期内不会消失。所有这些都表明，圣母大学的喧嚣可能不是一种偶然，而是预示着更多东西。

Earlier in the day, Mr. Gou donned a baseball cap and sunglasses and visited a temple in Taipei dedicated to a popular Taoist and Buddhist goddess, Mazu, who is believed to protect seafarers.
当天早些时候，郭台铭戴着棒球帽和太阳镜，前往台北一个供奉道教和佛教女神妈祖的寺庙参拜，妈祖被认为是航海者的保护神。

Unlike his rivals, he has no experience in government, but his personal wealth, estimated by Forbes to exceed $7 billion, will be an asset, both in terms of prestige and financing his campaign.
不同于竞选对手，他没有从政的经验，但他的个人财富――据《福布斯》(Forbes)估计超过70亿美元――无论是对他的声望，还是在提供竞选资金方面，都很有用。

Mr. Gou has long toyed with the idea of a presidential run, Mr. Gou’s business background will set him apart from candidates in both the parties.
郭台铭早有竞选总统的念头,郭台铭的商业背景将使他有别于民进党和国民党的其他候选人。

 Just days after Mr. Trump lavished praise on him in Washington, Mr. Gou showed China’s premier, Li Keqiang, around a Foxconn manufacturing facility in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou.
就在特朗普在华盛顿对郭台铭大加赞扬的几天后，郭台铭带着中国总理李克强参观了富士康位于中国中部城市郑州的一个生产园区。

Regardless who emerges as the Kuomintang candidate, the race promises to focus heavily on Taiwan’s tricky relationship with China. 
无论谁在国民党初选中胜出，台湾与中国大陆的微妙关系都将成为这次总统大选的重点。

President Tsai is facing a primary challenge within her party from her former premier, William Lai, who is an outspoken supporter of independence for Taiwan, in contrast to Ms. Tsai’s pragmatic approach.
蔡英文总统在党内面临着来自前行政院长赖清德的主要挑战。赖清德直言不讳地支持台湾独立，这与蔡英文的务实做法形成鲜明对比。

TikTok, the Chinese video app whose growth has been as viral as one of its lip-synced dance clips, has encountered a roadblock in India.
TikTok的成长速度就像它上面某个爆红的对口型跳舞视频一样，现在这款来自中国的视频应用在印度遇阻。

The lower court, based in Tamil Nadu State, is `hearing a petition` seeking a `ban` on the app, `on the grounds that` it `spreads pornography` and threatens the `well-being` of children.
泰米尔纳德邦的下级法院正在就寻求`禁止`这款应用的`请愿书举行听证`，`理由是`它`散播`色情信息，危害儿童`健康`。

TikTok’s `lax controls` have also `incurred the wrath` of American regulators.
TikTok`管控上的松懈`也`招致`了美国监管机构的`愤怒`。

Internet companies in the United States `are supposed to seek such consent` before allowing children to use their services, but India has no such regulations. That has left communities `struggling to cope with` technology’s influence on their children.
在美国，互联网企业在允许儿童使用其服务前`要先征得父母同意`，但印度没有这类规定。这已导致众多社区`很难应对`科技对儿童的影响。

`More broadly`, India’s central government is `wrestling with` an `overhaul` of its rules governing online services. 
`更广泛地说`，印度中央政府正`全力以赴`，对其在线服务管理规则进行`全面改革`。

Some Indian officials suspect that China’s government is using popular Chinese apps to `scoop up private data` on Indians.
一些印度官员怀疑，中国政府正在利用这些热门中国应用`采集印度公民的私人信息`。

“Wow, that’s `quite an achievement`!” Quake wrote back. “Hopefully she will `carry to term` …”
“哇，这真是一个`了不起的成就`！”奎克回信说。“希望她能`坚持到分娩`……”

Quake’s interactions with He reflect issues that leading scientific institutions are now `grappling with`.
奎克与贺建奎的互动反映了领先的科研机构目前正在`努力解决`的问题。

Quake is an entrepreneur whose inventions include blood tests to detect Down syndrome in pregnancy and to `avoid organ transplant rejection`.
奎克是一名企业家，他的发明包括用于检测妊娠期唐氏综合症以及`避免器官移植排异`的血液检测。

“I said, ‘That’s a terrible idea. Why would you want to do that?’” Quake `recalled`. “He `kind of pushed back` and it was clear that he wasn’t listening to me.”
“我说，‘这是个糟糕的主意。你为什么要做这个呢？’”奎克`回忆`说。“他`有点反驳`的意思，显然他没听我的话。”

“I didn’t think it was something `he would seriously do`,” said Quake, adding that he assumed if He sought `ethical approval` and was `rebuffed`, “`presumably` he’d stop.”
“我当时没觉得他`会把这事当真`，”奎克说，他接着说他以为贺建奎寻求过`伦理审批`然后被`拒`了，“`很可能`他会罢休。”

“If in my interactions with JK I had any `hint of misconduct`, I would have handled it completely differently. And I think `I would have been very aggressive about telling` people about that.”
奎克在接受采访时表示。“如果在跟JK的互动中，我觉察到了任何`行为不端的迹象`，那么我的处理方式会完全不同。并且我会`非常积极地去通报`这件事。”

He’s response `unsettled` him, he said. “`The little corner-cutting thing came up` again: ‘Well, there were actually two hospitals involved and you know, we had approval from one and we did work at both hospitals.’ And I said, ‘Well you better make sure you `have that straightened out`.’”
他说，贺建奎的回答让他`感到不安`。“`投机取巧的小花招又出现了`：‘实际上有两家医院参与，你知道，我们得到了一家医院的批准，我们在两家医院都在做。’我说，‘你最好`把这个解决好`。’”

Quake `pushed back`: “It is `prudent` to let the peer review process `follow its course`.”
奎克`反驳`说：“让同行评审`按部就班`完成这个过程是`明智之举`。”

“He was `spinning up this huge press thing` around it,” Quake explained in the interview. “`It was going to go well or poorly`, I didn’t really know. But `it wasn’t something I was involved in` and I didn’t want my name on it.”
“他是在围绕这件事`大肆炒作`，”奎克在接受采访时解释说。“我真的`不知道结果是好还是坏`。`但这件事与我无关`，我不想让我的名字出现在上面。”

“What do you want to be when you grow up?”When I was a kid, I `dreaded` the question. 
“长大后你想做什么？”在我的孩提时代，我`害怕`这个问题。

My first `beef with the question` is that it forces kids to define themselves `in terms of` work. When you’re asked what you want to be when you grow up, it’s not `socially acceptable to say`, “A father,” or, “A mother,” let alone, “A person of integrity.” 
对于这个问题我的第一个`不满`是，它逼迫孩子们用一种工作来定义自己。当你被问到长大以后想做什么时，回答“一个父亲”、“一个母亲”在`社交意义上是不可接受的`，更不要说“一个正直的人”了。

Although `having a calling` can be a source of joy, research shows that searching for one leaves students feeling `lost and confused`. And even if you’re `lucky enough to stumble onto a calling`, it might not be a `viable career`.
尽管`拥有天职`会是一种欢乐之源，但研究显示，寻找天职会让学生们感到`迷茫和困惑`。而且即便你`足够幸运碰上了一样天职`，它也可能不是个`可行的职业`。

Maybe four of them could be anything they want to be. But the other 2,000 `had better learn` how to `weld`. He added: “Tell the kids the truth. You can be anything you’re good at ― as long as they’re hiring.”
也许他们中有四人可能会成为任何他们想成为的人。但其他2000人`最好学会`怎么`焊接`。他接着说：“跟孩子说实话。你可以去做任何你擅长的事――前提是他们在招人。”

If you `manage to overcome` those `obstacles`, there is a third `hurdle`: Careers `rarely live up to` your childhood dreams.
如果你`能克服`这些`障碍`，还有第三道：职业`很少能达到`你童年梦想的期望。

In one study, looking for the ideal job left college seniors feeling more `anxious, stressed, overwhelmed and depressed` throughout the process ― and less satisfied with the outcome. As Tim Urban writes, `happiness is reality minus expectations`. If you’re looking for `bliss`, you’re `bound to` be disappointed. 
在一项研究中，寻找理想工作让高年级大学生在整个过程中感到更加`焦虑、压抑、无力和沮丧`―并对结果更加不满。如蒂姆・厄本(Tim Urban)所写，`幸福等于现实状况减去期望值`。如果你寻找的是`狂喜`，那么你`注定`会失望。

The `upside` of low expectations is that they `erase the gap` between what we wanted and what we got. `Extensive evidence` shows that instead of `painting a rosy picture` of a job, `you’re better off going in` with a realistic preview of what it’s really like, `warts and all`.
低期望值的一个`好处`是，它们能`消弭`我们所想与所得之间的差距。`大量证据`表明，与其把一份工作想象得很美好，还不如在入职时贴合实际地预想一下它真实的样子，并且`毫无保留`。

I’m all for encouraging youngsters to `aim high and dream big`. 
我完全支持年轻人`力争上游、志存高远`。

Mr. Pillsbury said he took that to imply that his visa application had been `stymied` in `reprisal` for the new restrictions.
白邦瑞说，他把该官员的意思理解为，他的签证申请`受阻`是对这些新限制的`报复`。

He used a `Chinese idiom` to `characterize` the move: killing a chicken to scare the monkeys, which means sending a warning by making someone an example.
他用了一个`中国成语`来`形容`这种报复：杀鸡儆猴，意思是惩罚某人以警戒他人。

F.B.I. had `rescinded` or put on review the visas of as many as 30 Chinese scholars who visit the United States, reflecting `growing concern` about Chinese intelligence-gathering.
FBI`吊销`了或重新审查了多达30名来美国访问的中国学者的签证，反映出政府对中国情报收集活动的`担忧日益加剧`。

Some people in China have their own label for the `polarizing` American president: savior.
对于这位让公众意见`两极分化的`美国总统，中国一些人有自己的标签：救世主。

At dinner tables, in social media chats and in `discreet conversations`, some of the country’s `intellectual` and business elite are `half-jokingly, half-seriously` cheering on the leader
在餐桌上、在社交媒体聊天时、在`谨慎的交谈`中，中国一些`知识分子`和商界精英`半开玩笑半认真地`为这位领导人喝彩

The chances that Mr. Trump alone can change China's ways are `exceedingly slim`.
单凭特朗普一人改变中国行事方式的几率`极其渺茫`。

“There’s only `a pool of stagnant water`.”
“只有一潭死水。”

leadership has `embraced` some `modest liberalization`. The government has promised to cut taxes, `ease other burdens` on the private sector and give markets `a somewhat bigger role` in the economy.
领导层已经接受了某种`适度的自由化`。政府已承诺减税、减轻民营部门负担，并让市场在经济中发挥更大作用。

But there’s little evidence that the leadership is `easing its grip in a lasting way`. The few `business-friendly gestures` are `reactive rather than proactive`. 
但鲜有证据表明，中国的领导层正在`以持久的方式放松管控`。为数不多的企业友好表态是`应对之举，而不是主动求变`。

There is a `caveat`: The signs of improvement most likely do not `stem from` a sudden burst of confidence in the strength of the country’s economy among Chinese business leaders.
但需要`警告`的是：经济好转的迹象很可能并非`源自`中国商界领袖对中国经济实力的信心突然爆发。
