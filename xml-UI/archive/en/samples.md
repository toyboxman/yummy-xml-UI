we have an old saying: “tian gao, huangdi yuan,” or, “the emperor is as far away as the sky.” We use it to reassure ourselves 
有句老话，叫“天高皇帝远”。我们用它来宽慰自己

a professor in international relations explained that Singapore was an authoritarian state, where the government wielded tremendous control over citizens’ daily lives.
一位国际关系教授解释说，新加坡是一个专制国家，政府对民众的日常生活指手画脚。

we could follow the commentary posted by public intellectuals there, so we wouldn’t have to simply accept the government’s narrative
可以在上面关注那些公共知识分子发表的评论，这样我们就不用只接受政府的一面之词

I couldn’t wait to go back home; I believed it was poised to become a place where idealists like me would thrive.
我迫不及待地想回家；我相信它会成为一个像我这样的理想主义者如鱼得水的地方

security checks were instituted in the subway system. We grew used to policemen checking people’s identity cards in interchange stations.
地铁系统增加了安检。慢慢地，我们习惯了警察在换乘站检查身份证。

a story that had gone viral in my WeChat feeds overnight: “A BBC reporter challenged China’s surveillance network ― and it took only seven minutes to capture him!” I couldn’t tell which terrified me more: China’s all-encompassing network of facial recognition surveillance cameras, or that my countrymen were proudly cheering them on.
看到一篇一夜走红的报道：“BBC记者挑战中国天网工程，潜逃七分钟后被抓获！”我说不出哪个更让我害怕：是中国无所不在的人脸识别监控摄像头网络，还是我的同胞们在骄傲地为它喝彩。

Entering train stations felt like crossing border control at an international airport ― my identity was not only confirmed by someone checking my documents, but also by one of the ubiquitous facial recognition cameras. 
进入火车站就像在国际机场通过边境管制一样――不仅有人检查我的文件并确认我的身份，无处不在的面部识别摄像头也在确认我的身份

Our mind-set, long ago, was wired to see safety and freedom as an either-or choice
长久以来，我们的思维定势是将安全和自由视为非此即彼的选择

As the United States and China edge closer to a trade agreement, the ability to reach a final deal is coming down to a central question: Will Beijing live up to its promises?
随着美国和中国距离一项贸易协议越来越近，最终达成协议将取决于一个核心问题：北京是否会兑现其承诺？

But it remains unclear which provisions of the trade deal will be subject to enforcement and how much power the United States will have to punish Beijing if it reneges on the agreement. The ability to secure a firm commitment from China to hold up its end of the pact or face repercussions will be a key determinant in whether President Trump’s trade deal is seen as a true win or a capitulation.
但目前尚不清楚贸易协议的哪些条款在这种执行的范围之内，以及如果北京违反协议，美国将拥有多大的惩罚权力。特朗普总统的贸易协议是被视为真正的胜利还是投降，关键决定因素将在于能否让中国明确承诺会履行协议，否则要面临报复。

China experts say enforcement is necessary given that the United States wants Beijing to make significant structural changes that will take time.
中国问题专家表示，鉴于美国希望北京做出的重大结构改革并非短时间内能完成，执行的机制是必要的

“I remain very cautious on this,” Mr. Allen said. “Will the Chinese really renounce the ability to retaliate at what they feel is an unfair trade action? I think it defies Chinese tradition.”
“我对此仍然非常谨慎，”艾伦说。“中国人真的会放弃报复的能力，哪怕看到他们认为不公平的贸易行为？我认为这不符合中国的一贯方式。”

Mr. Trump, who met with a Chinese delegation in the Oval Office last week, said negotiators might require four more weeks to finish ironing out the deal.
特朗普上周在椭圆形办公室会见了中国代表团，他表示谈判代表可能需要再过四周才能最终敲定协议。

I remain confident in the prospects of a deal, but I think we need to be cleareyed and understand that China could walk away from expected commitments in purchases, market access, intellectual property and other areas if they don’t get something out of this deal, and that’s tariff relief
我对交易的前景仍然充满信心，但我认为我们需要保持清醒的头脑，并且明白如果不能从协议中获得些什么，中国可能会放弃采购、市场准入、知识产权及其他方面预计会有的承诺，而他们想要的就是关税减免。

Far from panicking at his misfortune, he used his five months of severance pay to hang out for a few weeks with friends and ponder other career options
他非但没有对自己的厄运感到恐慌，反而用他拿到的五个月的遣散费和朋友们潇洒了几周，琢磨其他的职业选择

Yet as the Ford layoffs show, economic warning signs are starting to emerge in China. Inflation has gradually crept up. Economic growth has slowly eroded.
然而，如福特的裁员所显示的那样，经济预警信号已开始在中国出现。通货膨胀率已逐渐上升。经济增长则在慢慢减缓。

A huge pedestrian plaza in the Guanyinqiao neighborhood pulses with lights and crowds even on weekday nights. The trees are illuminated with bright lanterns.
观音桥附近的一个巨大的步行广场灯火通明，即使在工作日的晚上也是人潮涌动。树上挂着明亮的灯笼。

Under the ground burrows an extensive subway system. The monorail and subway were almost entirely built in the last 15 years.

From the Altai Mountains to the Pacific Coast, logging is ravaging Russia’s vast forests, leaving behind swathes of scarred earth studded with dying stumps.
从阿尔泰山脉到太平洋沿岸，砍伐正在毁坏俄罗斯广袤的森林，之后留下的，是伤痕累累的土地上遍布着的垂死树桩。

Since China began restricting commercial logging in its own natural forests two decades ago, it has increasingly turned to Russia, importing huge amounts of wood in 2017 to satisfy the voracious appetite of its construction companies and furniture manufacturers.
自二十年前开始限制本国天然森林的商业采伐以来，中国已日益将矛头转向俄罗斯，2017年进口了巨量木材，以满足其建筑公司和家具制造商的巨大需求。

Environmentalists say China has simply shifted the harm of unbridled logging from home to abroad, even as it reaps the economic benefits. Some warn that the scale of logging today could deplete what unspoiled forests remain, contributing to global warming.
环保主义者称，中国只是把肆无忌惮的采伐的危害从国内转移到了海外，甚至从中获得了经济利益。一些人士警告称，今天的伐木规模可能会耗尽未遭破坏的森林，从而加剧全球变暖。

It is one thing for Chinese demand to overwhelm small, poor nations desperate for cash, but it is another for it to drain the resources of a far larger country, one that regards itself as a superpower and a strategic partner to China.
中国的需求令急需现金的穷困小国无法招架是一回事，耗尽一个大国的资源就是另一回事了，而这个国家还将自己视为超级大国，以及中国的战略伙伴。

What we are doing now in Siberia and the Far East is destroying what is left of the original intact forest landscapes
我们眼下在西伯利亚和远东所做的事情正在把仅存的原始森林风景毁掉

The total value of China’s timber imports ― rough logs, timber or wood pulp ― has increased more than 10 times since China began restricting logging at home in 1998
1998年中国开始限制国内伐木以来，中国的木材进口总价值――粗原木、木材或木浆――增长了10倍以上

In many rural areas of the Russian Far East and Siberia, there are few other ways to make money, or to make a living, than stripping natural resources of the vast surrounding forests
在俄罗斯远东和西伯利亚的许多农村地区，除了剥夺周围大片森林的自然资源，几乎没有其他赚钱或谋生的方式

The business can be quite profitable, especially when Bitcoin prices are soaring, but the process requires considerable amounts of electricity.
这项业务非常有利可图，特别是在比特币价格飙升的时候，但这个过程需要耗费大量电力

At one point, China accounted for roughly two-thirds of all Bitcoin produced.
中国一度占到比特币总算力的三分之二左右。

But China keeps a tight grip over how much money flows in and out of its borders, and cryptocurrencies ― which are traded on decentralized computer networks and allow people to make transactions anonymously ― threatened to undermine those capital controls.
但中国严格控制资金的进出，而加密货币在分散的计算机网络上交易，并允许人们匿名交易，这就有可能破坏它对资本的管制。

The Chinese authorities began to ratchet up pressure on Bitcoin miners.
中国当局开始对比特币矿工施压

Just since 1990, the mortality rate for children under 5 has fallen in China by 83 percent ― suggesting, by my calculations, that an additional 676,000 Chinese children survive each year who previously would have died.
自1990年以来，中国五岁以下儿童死亡率下降了83%――根据我的计算，这意味着中国每年新增67.6万名儿童存活下来，在此之前他们可能死亡。

I used to believe that China was best approached with ambivalence, but in the last few years the ambivalence has faded into wariness.
我曾经认为，与中国打交道最好是带着点矛盾心理，但在最近几年，这种矛盾已逐渐演变成警惕。

First, to the extent possible, we should try to curb Chinese high-technology firms’ access to Western markets. These businesses are a security threat, and the Trump administration is right to be concerned. If a company like Huawei is asked to cooperate with Chinese State Security spies, its executives simply can’t say no.
首先，我们应该尽可能地限制中国高科技公司进入西方市场。这些企业是安全威胁，特朗普政府有理由感到担忧。如果像华为这样的公司被要求与中国国家安全间谍合作，它的高管们肯定不会说不。

China purchased a Boeing 767 in 2000 to be its presidential jet and it arrived riddled with listening devices. China inevitably will try to do to us what we already did to it.
2000年，中国购买了一架波音767飞机作为其领导人专机，飞机交付时安装了许多监听设备。中国将会试图对我们做的事情，我们也做过，这是不可避免的。

A few days ago, China announced that it would soon ban all variants of fentanyl, a welcome step that may make a difference. But China often promises cooperation that does not materialize, and everything will depend on enforcement over the country’s 160,000 chemical companies. Too many lives hang in the balance to take China at its word.
几天前，中国宣布将很快禁止所有种类的芬太尼，这是一个令人欣喜的举措，可能会产生效果。但中国承诺的合作经常得不到实现，一切将取决于对中国16万家化工企业的执法。这关系到太多生命，不能只听中国嘴上说说就当真。

Neighbors become informants. Children are interrogated. Mosques are monitored.
邻居成为告密者。儿童遭到审问。清真寺被监控。

Muslim minorities line up, stone-faced, to swipe their official identity cards. At big checkpoints, they lift their chins while a machine takes their photos, and wait to be notified if they can go on.
少数民族穆斯林面无表情地排队刷身份证。大型岗哨会有机器给他们拍照，他们抬起下巴，等待放行通知。

The extra money is not coming from Juilliard. The local government is footing the bill. And that could become a problem for officials struggling with debt after an epic spending spree to develop a new commercial center from scratch.
额外的钱不是由茱莉亚学院出资，而是由当地政府埋单。对已经在大举花钱从无到有建起一座商业中心的政府而言，这可能会成为问题。

Four-fifths of the office space stands empty. Construction on other buildings has stopped, leaving skeletons in the sky. A sprawling mall has few shoppers. 
其中五分之四的办公空间是空的。其他建筑物的建设已经停止，只留下高耸的骨架。一个庞大的购物中心几乎没有顾客。

Chinese local governments are swimming in debt. By official accounts, that debt totals $4.5 trillion. By unofficial estimates, it could be as large as $10 trillion. No one knows for sure because much of the borrowing for projects like the Tianjin Juilliard campus is rarely disclosed.
中国地方政府债台高筑。据官方统计，债务总额为4.5万亿美元。据非官方估计，这一数字可能高达10万亿美元。没有人确切知道，因为像天津茱莉亚音乐学院这种项目的贷款很少被披露。

But China is not growing as fast as it used to, and it is not clear that the “build it and they will come” model will save Yujiapu and other places with big debts. The national government now must find other ways to spur growth ― without making the debt problem worse.
但中国的经济增长速度已不如从前，“只要盖好了，一切都会来”的模式能否拯救于家堡等债台高筑的地方，目前还不清楚。国家政府现在必须找到其他方法来刺激经济增长――同时不让债务问题更加恶化。

If Yujiapu really is the Manhattan of China, it has a way to go to catch up to the real thing. Its avenues, some nearly as wide as Broadway, are eerily quiet.
如果于家堡真是中国的曼哈顿，那它还有很长的路要走。它的街道有些几乎和百老汇一样宽，但是出奇的安静

If the political will collapses for the Binhai area, then the bank loans will begin to dry up and the whole area is in trouble
如果滨海新区的政治意志崩溃，那么银行贷款将开始枯竭，整个地区都会陷入困境

Many residents believe Yujiapu’s problems have been overstated and try to cast its emptiness in a positive light
许多居民认为于家堡的问题被夸大了，并试图从正面看待空置现象

“Now, there are `quite a lot of` internet companies, including some e-commerce platforms,” he said, `speculating` that these companies could move into his building in the future.
“现在你看互联网公司就比较多了，包括一些电商平台，”他说，他`猜测`这些公司将来会搬进他所在的大楼。
