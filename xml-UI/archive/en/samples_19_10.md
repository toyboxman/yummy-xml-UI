Forty years after China began its `near-miraculous run` as the world’s most powerful economic growth engine, its people are experiencing something new and `unsettling: a feeling that the best times may be behind them`.
作为世界上最强大的经济增长引擎奇迹般地运行了四十年后，中国的人民正在经历一种令人不安的新感觉：最好的时代可能已经过去。

Wage growth is `sluggish`. More young people are `chasing fewer job prospects`.They are going to the movies less and taking fewer trips abroad. They `would rather stick their money in the bank`.
工资增长缓慢。更多的年轻人追逐更少的工作岗位。他们去影院的次数少了，出国旅行也少了。他们宁愿把钱存在银行。

For China’s young people, who have never experienced `a prolonged slump` in their lives, the shift is `especially stark`
中国的年轻人在生活中从未经历过长时间的下滑，对于他们来说，这种转变尤为明显

They are now starting to think maybe this` inexorable increase` in economic growth is not so inexorable
他们现在开始认为，这种不可阻挡的经济增长或许没有那么不可阻挡

`Nothing is good`. It’s not just this one type of business, `Every kind of business is not doing so great.`
什么都不景气。不光是这一行，各行各业都不怎么样

Still, signs of a `slowdown abound`. Sales of `instant noodles`, seen as an indicator because `newly affluent` Chinese `would rather eat out or order in`, are rising after declining for several years.
但放缓的迹象无处不在。方便面的销量在经历几年的下降后出现增长，这被认为是一个指标，因为新富起来的中国人倾向于外出就餐或叫外卖。

In past years, those shoppers were part of a `seemingly unstoppable growth engine`. China’s opening to the outside world in the late 1970s connected global companies with one billion people `eager to leave grinding poverty behind`.
过去几年来，这类消费者是一台看似不可阻挡的增长引擎的一部分。20世纪70年代末中国的对外开放，将全球企业和10亿迫切想要摆脱极度贫困的民众联系在了一起。

`On the occasion of` the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China (P.R.C.) on Oct. 1, the party-state has much to celebrate: `an unprecedented record` of economic development, world-class education and technological innovation, an increasingly `prominent position on the world stage`
在10月1日庆祝中华人民共和国成立70周年的时候，这个党国有许多值得庆祝的事情：史无前例的经济发展纪录，世界一流的教育和技术创新，在世界舞台上日益显著的地位

Rather, they `result from the fact` that when the C.C.P. came to power 70 years ago, it took over not `a homogeneous China`, but `a sprawling empire with a variety of peoples`
它们其实源于这样一个事实，即中共70年前上台时接管的不是一个单一民族的中国，而是一个幅员辽阔、多民族的帝国

it is the Qing empire (1636C1912) that is responsible for `the rooster-shape territory` we now associate with China
但现在与中国联系起来的公鸡形状的领土，是大清帝国（1636C1912）的功劳

Chinese first began settling Taiwan in the early 1600s, and in 1683 the Qing `put Chinese colonists and indigenous Taiwanese under two distinct kinds of administration. `
中国人于17世纪初开始到台湾定居，1683年清政府将中国殖民者和台湾原住民置于两种截然不同的行政管理之下。

The Qing conquered Xinjiang, to the west, in 1759, `the culmination of a long-running struggle with` the Zunghar Mongols for dominance in Central Asia. `The imperial court` ran Xinjiang under loose military rule, allowing indigenous elites to manage local affairs. 
1759年，清政府征服了西部的新疆，这是清政府与准噶尔部长期争夺中亚统治地位的最终结果。大清朝廷对新疆实行了松散的军事统治，允许当地精英管理地方事务。

Chinese settlers followed, colonizing parts of northern Xinjiang. Tibet, too, `fell under Qing control` during the Zunghar wars, `thanks to a combination of military intervention and religious diplomacy`. The Tibetan lamas and Qing emperors `agreed in principle to split spiritual and secular realms of authority` between them, `in a formula known as the “priest-patron relationship.”`
中国移民随之而来，在新疆北部开拓了殖民地。西藏也在准噶尔之役期间，被清王朝用军事干预和宗教外交相结合的手段控制。西藏的喇嘛和清朝的皇帝原则上同意将宗教和世俗领域的权威分开，按照一个名为“供施关系”的模式由他们分别管辖

`The city was ceded` by the Qing to Britain in the 1842 Treaty of Nanking that ended `the first Opium War` ― the same treaty that `opened treaty ports elsewhere on the Chinese coast to western commerce`. This infamous agreement, widely known as `an “unequal treaty,” is unquestionably a case of British imperialist aggression`
清政府在1842年签署了结束第一次鸦片战争的《南京条约》，条约把香港割让给了英国，并在中国沿海的其他地方设立了对西方贸易开放的通商口岸。这个臭名昭著的条约被普遍称为“不平等条约”，它无疑是大英帝国侵犯的一个例子

`Trade enclaves may have been a foreign imposition`, but they were also a tool of the Qing state.
虽然贸易租界可能是外国不公平的要求，但它们也是清政府的工具

The early P.R.C., then, recognized and `drew upon` the Qing tradition `with flexible approaches to diversity and sovereignty`
在建国之初，曾承认并借鉴了清朝用灵活方式对待多元化和主权的传统

he accepted `a lukewarm deal` because he wanted the Chinese to help him `get dirt on his political enemies.`
他因为想要中国人帮他抹黑政敌，接受了一个不痛不痒的协议。

Other Republicans `were more temperate`
其他共和党人则更相对克制

Chinese officials have also been `laying the groundwork for` a potential agreement `by subtly shifting their stance` in recent weeks
最近几周，中国官员还通过微妙地转变立场，为可能达成的协议奠定基础。

`An earnest propaganda anthem` from 1985, the song typically wouldn’t `stand a chance against` Taylor Swift, K-pop and other modern tunes the 18-year-old college student and her friends like to listen to.
这首郑重其事的宣传歌曲创作于1985年，一般来说，本不会让这名18岁的大学生和她的朋友们感兴趣，她们喜欢听泰勒・斯威夫特(Taylor Swift)、韩国流行音乐(K-pop)和其他现代歌曲。

Then they `shed more tears` while watching Tuesday’s parade in Beijing celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, a procession `replete with images of progress and sacrifice.`
接下来，她们上周二观看在北京举行的庆祝中华人民共和国成立70周年的阅兵式时，流了更多的眼泪，游行中充满了进步和牺牲的画面。

After I watched the movie and the military parade, I sang it `from the bottom of my heart`
看了电影和阅兵之后，唱起来是发自肺腑的

Angry demonstrators showing their dislike of the Chinese government have left many people in China `feeling both defensive and proud of their country’s accomplishments.`
愤怒的示威者表达了对中国政府的厌恶，这让许多中国人既有抵触情绪，又为自己国家的成就感到骄傲。

In 40 years, they have `lifted their country out of poverty` while avoiding the wars and unrest that have `plagued much of the developing world`. Modern China has its problems, but most Chinese believe it is still `vibrant and full of opportunity` 40年来，他们使国家摆脱了贫困，避免了困扰许多发展中国家的战争和动荡。虽然现代中国有自己的问题，但大多数中国人认为国家仍然充满活力和机会

The Chinese internet has proved to be `a fruitful place` for the party to spread its message
事实证明，中国的互联网是中共传播信息的一个富有成效的地方

The characters were `flawed human beings` instead of the `epic heroes` one usually sees in patriotic films, he wrote in a social media post.
他在社交媒体上发帖写道，影片中的角色是有人性瑕疵的普通人，而不是人们通常在爱国电影中看到的大英雄。

China certainly didn’t invent `tug-at-the-heart patriotism`, as anybody who has seen “Saving Private Ryan” can `attest`
中国当然不是牵动人心的爱国主义的发明者，任何看过《拯救大兵瑞恩》的人都可以证明这一点。

When supplies of China’s favorite meat `run low`, Beijing `calls upon its strategic pork reserve`, a name that brings to mind `vast piles of sausages, bacon and spareribs housed in secret underground vaults` across the country.
当猪肉供应不足时，北京会动用这种中国人最喜爱的肉类的战略储备，听起来仿佛是全国各地的秘密地窖里有堆积成山的香肠、培根和排骨。

Pork prices in China today are `skyrocketing`, the result of `an epidemic that is ravaging the country’s hogs`, and the government has been `drawing upon its reserves` to lift supplies for shoppers.
由于一场在生猪中肆虐的流行病，中国的猪肉价格飞涨，政府一直在动用储备增加对消费者的供应

As the country introduced market reforms, reserves became a tool for `controlling price swings`, not just for pork, but for beef, chicken and lamb, too.
随着中国引入市场改革，储备成为控制价格波动的手段，并且不仅有猪肉，也有牛肉、鸡肉和羊肉

The investment bank predicts that the nation will `produce 30 percent less pork this year compared with last year`, a drop of 16 million tons. Against those numbers, even 200,000 tons of emergency meat can `seem like a drop in the ocean.`
投资银行预测，中国今年的猪肉产量将比去年降低30%，减少1600万吨。在这些数字面前，即便20万吨的肉类紧急储备似乎也是杯水车薪

These companies mostly keep their pork in `unmarked suburban warehouses`, where the meat stays at `the state-mandated temperature of minus-18 degrees Celsius, or just under zero degrees Fahrenheit. `
这些公司大多将猪肉存放在无标记的郊区仓库中，在那里，猪肉保持着国家规定的温度，即零下18摄氏度或华氏零度以下

In 2007, when reporters in Shandong `visited a farm that bred pigs` for the provincial reserve, they found tens of thousands of hogs running around in what `sounded like pretty idyllic conditions`: “The area is lush with vegetation and shaded by trees. The hog house is `tall and spacious`. There is heating in the winter and `ventilator fans` in the summer.”
2007年，山东的记者走访了一个为省级储备肉基地饲养猪的养殖场，他们发现成千上万的猪在听起来像是优美的田园环境中四处活动：“猪舍周围植被茂密，绿树成阴，猪舍高大宽敞，冬天有供暖，夏天有换气扇。”

It was cheaper than the “non-reserve pork” he found at the same `meat counter`, he said, so he `gave it a shot.`
这块肉比他在同一个肉柜台里找到的“非储备猪肉”便宜，所以他试了一下

Researchers in China have found `a significant link` between air pollution and `the risk of miscarriage`
中国研究人员发现，空气污染和流产风险之间存在显著的相关性

The researchers looked at `four types of air pollutants: a deadly fine particulate matter` known as PM2.5, `sulfur dioxide, ozone and carbon monoxide`
研究人员查看了四类污染物：被称为PM2.5的致命细颗粒物、二氧化硫、臭氧和一氧化碳

There has been a lot of evidence `suggesting a link between air pollution and pregnancy outcomes in general`, particularly the risk of a premature birth and a low weight baby, This is one of the first studies to `link particle pollution to` this particular outcome of pregnancy so `in that sense it’s very important`.
有大量证据表明，空气污染与怀孕结果总体上存在关联，尤其是早产和婴儿出生体重低的风险，这是首批将颗粒污染与怀孕结果联系起来的研究之一，从这个意义上讲，它很重要。

`Footage of the parade` showed Chinese `military aircraft streaking multicolored smoke trails across grimy skies`
阅兵画面显示，中国军机在污浊的天空中拖着五颜六色的烟雾

When the Chinese came to the village of Lat Thahae, `perched on a muddy bend of` a Mekong River tributary, they `scrawled a Chinese character on` the walls of homes, schools and Buddhist temples.
中国人来到坐落于湄公河支流一个泥泞转弯处的拉特海村后，在房屋、学校和寺庙的墙上写下一个汉字

This year, a dam will begin transforming `this stretch of jagged hills and pristine jungle` in one of the world’s most remote countries, part of a broader effort to `propel some of Asia’s least-developed economies`
今年，一座大坝已在这里建成，它将开始改变这个世界上最偏远国家之一的一片崎岖山峦和原始丛林，这是推动亚洲一些最不发达经济体的更广泛努力的一部分

Are these dams `for the good of the Mekong downstream countries`, or are they for the good of a country that’s trying to `gain economic influence and offload excess capacity?`
这些大坝是为了湄公河下游国家的利益呢，还是这样试图获得经济影响力、转嫁过剩产能的国家的利益呢？
