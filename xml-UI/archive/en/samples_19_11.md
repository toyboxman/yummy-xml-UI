如今在谈及丑闻时使用的许多骇人的、极具冲击力的术语，有不少来自当年对水门事件的报道。比如“bombshell”（爆炸性事件）和“smoking gun”（铁证）。从那以后，我们就像测噪音分贝那样衡量争议，评判那些“火爆”和“劲爆”的惊人事件

特别是，我现在几乎所有专栏文章的案头和撰写都是用iPad（我仍然通过对着耳机说话来写许多初稿，但我是个怪人）

I thought I had `gotten out of the gadget-reviewing business for good` last year. Since the smartphone had `gobbled up everything` from cameras to music players to portable gaming systems, I declared the whole field of gadgetry dead. But just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in
去年，我以为自己永远离开了电子产品评测行业。由于智能手机吞噬了从相机到音乐播放器再到便携游戏系统的一切，我宣告整个电子设备领域的死亡。但就在我以为自己出局的时候，它们又把我拉了回来

The history of the iPad is a story about `consolidation, focus and the power of scale` in the tech business. It’s a story about `how thoroughly one company`, Apple, has `dominated the entire hardware business` this decade. And it is also, really, a story about the only thing that mattered in tech in the 2010s ― the smartphone ― and the way that one device `became the gravitational center` of the entire tech business, `shaping every market` in the industry, and much of the non-tech world beyond it
IPad的历史是一则技术行业整合、聚焦和规模化力量的故事，是关于苹果公司如何彻底统治整个硬件行业的故事。而且，真的，它也关乎2010年代科技产业内唯一一件重要的东西――智能手机――以及一个设备怎样成为整个技术企业的中心，塑造着技术行业的每一个市场，以及它自身之外非技术世界的大部分市场

The iPad has always `been freighted with great expectations`. Although the iPad was unveiled in 2010, three years after the iPhone, `development of the iPad predated development of the phone`, and Steve Jobs, Apple’s co-founder, always seemed to `have his heart in the tablet`
人们对iPad一直抱有很大的期待。尽管是在iPhone发布三年后的2010年发布的，iPad的开发早于iPhone，而苹果的联合创始人史蒂夫・乔布斯似乎总对平板电脑情有独钟

The traditional Mac and Windows machines `would still be around, but like big rigs`, they’d be used by a small set of power users for `a dwindling set of specific, high-power tasks`

有一段时间，他的话只有部分是正确的。iPad一上市就卖得很好，但几年后就遇到了一些障碍。乔布斯去世后，苹果公司任凭iPad逐渐衰落，对待Mac也同样如此

The smartphone also `altered the business dynamics` of the tech industry, and `decimated a host of phone brands` (remember Nokia? Motorola?)
智能手机还改变了科技行业的商业格局, 摧毁了许多手机品牌（还记得诺基亚吗？）

Apple’s dominance `came despite the fact` that the company made some big mistakes and was late to many big innovations. Samsung, not Apple, invented huge-screen phones. Apple’s Mac line `was plagued by delays and dead ends`
苹果公司占据主导地位的同时也犯了一些大错，而且在很多重大创新上都晚了一步。发明大屏幕手机的不是苹果，而是三星。苹果的Mac系列产品频频出现延期，找不到出路
