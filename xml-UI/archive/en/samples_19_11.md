In control theory, `a causal system` is a system where the output depends on past and current inputs but not future inputs―i.e., the output depends on only the input.
在控制理论中，因果系统是一个结果输出依赖于当前和之前系统输入而不依赖于系统未来的输入

The biggest shopping day in China `is fast approaching`, and American companies `are treading carefully`.
中国最大的购物日即将来临，美国公司则在谨慎行事。

Some 22,000 international merchants are expected to offer discounts and other deals, mostly online, `without the overnight lines and doorbuster bargains` associated with Black Friday in the United States.
预计约有2.2万家国际商家将提供折扣及其他优惠活动，主要在线上进行，不会出现美国的“黑色星期五”那样通宵排队和开门大抢购

American companies, facing increasing pressure in the United States to `take a stand on social issues`, have `lately stayed away from any whiff of` the political in ads that appear in China. They `definitely talk about being conservative`, and they try to double-check things over and over again
由于在美国面临着越来越大的压力，要在社会问题上表明立场，美国企业近来在中国发布的广告中都避开了任何有政治意味的内容。他们肯定在说要保守行事，他们还会一遍又一遍地反复检查

A few days before Singles Day, advertisements from companies like Dell, Nike and Procter & Gamble `were more functional than flashy`, focused largely on discounts
“双11”到来几天前，戴尔(Dell)、耐克(Nike)和宝洁等公司发布的广告都比较平实，不太显眼，主要突出折扣

A growing number of China’s smaller banks `are stumbling` as Beijing tries to `navigate a difficult path`, forcing regulators to balance economic concerns with the health of `an enormous but fractured financial system`.
正当北京试图走出困途，越来越多的中国中小银行陷入困境，迫使监管机构在经济担忧和庞大但支离破碎的金融系统的健康之间找到平衡

At the same time, years of borrowing have `left the country’s financial system riddled with trillions of dollars’ worth of debt`. Much of it is hidden off the books, `raising the prospect of potentially devastating debt bombs lurking in unexpected corners.`
同时，多年的借贷使中国的金融体系充斥着数万亿美元的债务。其中大部分不显示在账目上，这增加了潜在毁灭性债务炸弹潜伏在意想不到角落的可能性

In the past few years, some banks have `expanded blindly`, Many of them also `played tricks with` their accounting. Then, two years ago, a new top banking regulator `pledged to rein in reckless lending` by banks and other financial institutions.
前些年，有些银行盲目扩张 它们很多还在做账的时候玩花招, 然后，在两年前，最高银行监管机构的新监管人承诺，要控制银行和其他金融机构轻率放出的贷款。

Soon online lenders that once offered `eye-watering returns` were `put out of business`, companies `began to default on their bonds` and banks were told to stop hiding bad loans. In the process, a number of smaller Chinese banks were shown to `be less than healthy`
不久，那些曾经提供惊人回报的在线放贷公司被迫停业，公司开始拖欠债券，银行也被告知要停止隐瞒不良贷款。在此过程中，许多中国的中小银行表现不佳

Weeks later, a unit of China’s `sovereign wealth fund injected cash into` Hengfeng Bank, a bank based in the coastal city of Yantai
几周后，中国主权财富基金的一个下属机构向沿海城市烟台的恒丰银行注资

In her confession, she said she had hoped the video `“would go viral.”`

The seventh `defendant`, Wayne Marino, was expected to `surrender to the authorities` on Friday. 
第7名被告韦恩・马里诺预计将于周五向当局自首

The defendants `were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and illegal importation`. Jack and Frances Cabasso, `a married couple`, were also charged with `money laundering conspiracy`

Obviously it’s `a grave concern` to the United States that infrastructure `is compromised` by hardware and software made in other countries
基础设施被其他国制造的硬件和软件损害，这显然是美国严重关切的问题

In a memo seeking to `detain Mr. Cabasso in custody until trial`, prosecutors `portrayed him as a serial con man` with a long criminal history
在一份寻求对候审期间的卡帕索实施拘禁的备忘录中，检察官将他描述为一个有着长期犯罪史的连环诈骗犯

Since 1982, prosecutors said, he `had been convicted of jury tampering, grand larceny and other crimes`. He had deep business relationships in China and used a network of `shell companies to launder` the millions of dollars he made.
自1982年以来，他已被判犯有干扰陪审团、重大盗窃罪及其他罪行。检察官的备忘录称，他和中国有着很深的商业关系，并利用空壳公司网络清洗自己赚得的数百万美元黑钱

Prosecutors `seized the Cabassos’ 70-foot luxury yacht`, the Tranquilo, and `froze 12 bank accounts` containing around $3 million
检察官查扣了卡帕索的一艘70英尺长的豪华游艇“平静号”，并冻结了12个银行账户，其中有大约300万美元

Cryptocurrency makers and watchers said the comments `were most likely meant to pave the way for China to create its own digital currency`, both to tighten controls as well as to make China’s currency `more readily available outside the country`
加密货币制造商和观察人士表示，这番表态极有可能是为中国创造自己的数字货币铺平道路，以便加强控制，同时让中国的货币在境外更容易获得

The comments led to `a surge in interest` in China. Investors `sent shares of local digital currency-related companies soaring`, while cryptocurrency `stalwarts rejoiced`
此番表态使中国国内对加密货币的兴趣激增。在投资者的推动下，与数字货币有关的本地企业股价飙升，加密货币的忠实支持者则欢欣鼓舞

China also wants to `track money flowing across its borders`, both to `tamp down on corruption` and to `protect the economy from violent swings in currency value.`
中国还希望追踪跨境资金流动，以打击腐败，同时保护经济免受币值剧烈波动的影响

The Chinese government has released new rules `aimed at curbing video game addiction` among young people, a problem that top officials believe is to `blame for a rise in nearsightedness and poor academic performance` across `a broad swath of society`
中国政府发布了旨在遏制年轻人沉迷电子游戏的新规定，高层官员认为，这个问题是全社会越来越多年轻人出现近视和学习不佳的原因

The state-run media has `likened some games to “poison,”` and the government has blocked sales of some titles `on the grounds that` they are too violent.

These problems `affect the physical and mental health of minors`, as well as their normal learning and living. There are always going to be loopholes
这些问题影响未成年人身心健康和正常学习生活 总会有漏洞

As China matures and develops further, `the uniqueness that Hong Kong provides` is going to continue to diminish, but likely over `a gradual pace`
随着中国的成熟和进一步发展，香港所提供的独特性将不断减弱，但这可能是一个渐进的过程

The media coverage of Watergate gave us much of today’s `concussive, ballistic jargon` of scandal. There were “`bombshells`.” There were “`smoking guns`.” `Ever since`, we have measured controversies as if on a decibel meter, `judging them by their “fireworks” and “explosive” drama`.
如今在谈及丑闻时使用的许多骇人的、极具冲击力的术语，有不少来自当年对水门事件的报道。比如“bombshell”（爆炸性事件）和“smoking gun”（铁证）。从那以后，我们就像测噪音分贝那样衡量争议，评判那些“火爆”和“劲爆”的惊人事件

I `arrive red-eyed and sleepy` to work now and don’t care. `Stumblin’ Sam` can’t even `read his script straight! WITCH HUNT!!!`
我现在睡眼惺忪地来上班，我根本不在乎   磕巴山姆连自己的剧本都读不对！政治迫害！！！

Beijing officials said the two infected people came from Inner Mongolia, `a sparsely populated region` of northern China
北京官员表示，两名感染者来自内蒙古，中国北方一个人口稀少的地区

`Fears are mounting` in China over a possible outbreak of the disease, once known as the Black Death. Last month, the authorities in China said they would `strengthen quarantine measures` to prevent plague from `entering the country` after Madagascar `was struck by a fast-spreading outbreak of the disease.`
在中国，对这种疾病可能爆发的担忧正在增长。它曾被称为“黑死病”.  上个月，中国当局表示将加强检疫措施，防范鼠疫进入中国。此前，马达加斯加曾爆发迅速蔓延的鼠疫疫情

Signs of any `infectious disease` need to be repeatedly verified and investigated, and such announcements cannot be `“transmitted casually.”` 
任何传染病的迹象都需要反复核实和调查，这样的消息不能“随便发”。

"`After so many years of specialist training`, I’m familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of most `respiratory diseases`,” wrote Dr. Li. “But this time, I looked and looked at it. I couldn’t guess what pathogen caused this `pneumonia`. I only knew it was rare.”
“经过这么多年的专科培训，对于绝大多数呼吸系统疾病的诊疗，我已驾轻就熟，”李积凤写道。“但是这一次，我看了又看，完全推测不出是什么病原体导致的肺炎，只觉得是少见病。”

`If left untreated`, pneumonic plague is always fatal, according to the World Health Organization. But recovery rates are high `if detected and treated with antibiotics, within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms`, the agency said.
根据世界卫生组织的说法，如果没有得到及时治疗，鼠疫通常是致命的。但该机构也表示，如果在症状发作后的24小时内被确诊并得到抗生素治疗，康复率相当高

I’m `shaking and trembling.`
我简直瑟瑟发抖好吗

Apple unveiled a new 16-inch MacBook with `a revamped keyboard` on Wednesday, good news for the many Apple lovers who’ve been `grumbling` about the company’s `lackluster slate of recent Macs`
苹果公司于周三发布了一款全新的16英寸MacBook，键盘经过了改进，这对很多一直抱怨最近几款Mac电脑缺乏亮点的苹果爱好者来说是个好消息

But I think the iPad is already beginning to `eclipse the traditional personal computer`
但我认为iPad已经开始超越传统个人电脑

Tablets were `good for surfing the Web` and watching Netflix, but they’ve always `been dogged by the charge` that you couldn’t get a lot of work done on them
平板电脑本来很适合上网、看Netflix，但它们总被指责没法用来做太多工作

`Among other things`, I now research and write just about `every column` using an iPad (I still `compose many first drafts` by speaking into my headphones, but I’m `an odd duck`)
特别是，我现在几乎所有专栏文章的案头和撰写都是用iPad（我仍然通过对着耳机说话来写许多初稿，但我是个怪人）

I thought I had `gotten out of the gadget-reviewing business for good` last year. Since the smartphone had `gobbled up everything` from cameras to music players to portable gaming systems, I declared the whole field of gadgetry dead. But just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in
去年，我以为自己永远离开了电子产品评测行业。由于智能手机吞噬了从相机到音乐播放器再到便携游戏系统的一切，我宣告整个电子设备领域的死亡。但就在我以为自己出局的时候，它们又把我拉了回来

The history of the iPad is a story about `consolidation, focus and the power of scale` in the tech business. It’s a story about `how thoroughly one company`, Apple, has `dominated the entire hardware business` this decade. And it is also, really, a story about the only thing that mattered in tech in the 2010s ― the smartphone ― and the way that one device `became the gravitational center` of the entire tech business, `shaping every market` in the industry, and much of the non-tech world beyond it
IPad的历史是一则技术行业整合、聚焦和规模化力量的故事，是关于苹果公司如何彻底统治整个硬件行业的故事。而且，真的，它也关乎2010年代科技产业内唯一一件重要的东西――智能手机――以及一个设备怎样成为整个技术企业的中心，塑造着技术行业的每一个市场，以及它自身之外非技术世界的大部分市场

The iPad has always `been freighted with great expectations`. Although the iPad was unveiled in 2010, three years after the iPhone, `development of the iPad predated development of the phone`, and Steve Jobs, Apple’s co-founder, always seemed to `have his heart in the tablet`
人们对iPad一直抱有很大的期待。尽管是在iPhone发布三年后的2010年发布的，iPad的开发早于iPhone，而苹果的联合创始人史蒂夫・乔布斯似乎总对平板电脑情有独钟

The traditional Mac and Windows machines `would still be around, but like big rigs`, they’d be used by a small set of power users for `a dwindling set of specific, high-power tasks`
传统的Mac和Windows电脑仍将存在，但像大型钻机一样，它们将只被一小部分高级用户用于越来越少的特定高强度任务

For a while, he was only `partially right`. The iPad sold well `at launch`, but after a few years it `hit some hurdles`. After Jobs’s death, Apple `left the iPad to languish, and did something similar with the Mac`
有一段时间，他的话只有部分是正确的。iPad一上市就卖得很好，但几年后就遇到了一些障碍。乔布斯去世后，苹果公司任凭iPad逐渐衰落，对待Mac也同样如此

The smartphone also `altered the business dynamics` of the tech industry, and `decimated a host of phone brands` (remember Nokia? Motorola?)
智能手机还改变了科技行业的商业格局, 摧毁了许多手机品牌（还记得诺基亚吗？）

Apple’s dominance `came despite the fact` that the company made some big mistakes and was late to many big innovations. Samsung, not Apple, invented huge-screen phones. Apple’s Mac line `was plagued by delays and dead ends`
苹果公司占据主导地位的同时也犯了一些大错，而且在很多重大创新上都晚了一步。发明大屏幕手机的不是苹果，而是三星。苹果的Mac系列产品频频出现延期，找不到出路

The three days `leading up to` Thanksgiving are manic at Kau Kau BBQ Market & Restaurant, `a mainstay` in Seattle’s Chinatown that `specializes in` Chinese barbecue. At least two extra cooks are brought on to help `clean, brine, dry, baste and roast` holiday turkeys 24 hours a day in the kitchen’s already `packed ovens: crisp-skinned, five-spice-seasoned birds` that Kau Kau makes according to the same process it uses for its roast duck.
感恩节前的三天，巧巧海鲜烧腊饭店一片忙乱，这是西雅图华埠主打中式烧烤的一家招牌餐厅。餐厅至少多雇了两名厨师，帮忙一天24小时清洗、腌渍、风干火鸡，然后刷汁塞进已经满满当当的烤箱里烤：巧巧用制作烤鸭的同样流程制作的脆皮五香火鸡

There is one day of the year when roast duck, `soy-sauce chicken, char siu and crispy roast pork` may be cast aside for `plump turkeys`. Available from chains like 99 Ranch Market and `mom-and-pop shops alike`, and often with `sticky rice, steamed buns and hoisin-based sauces` on the side, these Chinese barbecue-style turkeys provide `an inroad to` Thanksgiving for many Chinese-Americans
一年中总有一天，烤鸭、酱油鸡、叉烧和脆皮烧肉可能会被人们抛到一边，转而享用圆滚滚的火鸡。这种中式烧烤火鸡可以从大华超级市场和夫妻档店铺买到，一般会配上糯米、馒头和海鲜酱，对很多华裔美国人而言，它们是往感恩节中注入自己的影响的一个好办法

“If they don’t, we usually `kind of worry`,” Mr. Chang said. “We `hope nothing happened to them`.”
“如果他们没点，我们通常会有点担心，”理查德・张说。“我们希望他们平安无事。”

But `the main draw of` a turkey roasted according to `the lengthy procedures` of professional Chinese barbecue is `juicy, flavorful meat`.
但按照中国专业烧烤的漫长程序烤制的火鸡，主要吸引力是多汁、美味的肉

`Rather than filling the turkey’s cavity with a bready stuffing` to roast, Chinese barbecue cooks typically fill it many hours ahead `with a wet, mushy marinade` that may include toasted `dry spices, onions, garlic, ginger and plenty of salt`, then `skewer the cavity shut`.
中国的烧烤厨师通常会提前几小时用湿糊状的腌料填满火鸡腔，其中可能包括烘烤过的干香料、洋葱、大蒜、姜和大量的盐，然后用串肉扦把内腔合上，而不是用面包填料填满腔体，进行烤制

He `passed that knowledge on to` his sons, although the brothers have `made slight tweaks to the classic recipes`. That includes the shop’s Thanksgiving turkey, which `dates back to the time before` their father joined the business
他把这些知识传给了两个儿子，尽管兄弟俩对这些经典食谱做了些小的修改。其中包括这家店的感恩节火鸡，这道菜在他们的父亲进入这家店工作之前就已经有了

For their `in-demand turkey`, the Cheungs apply `a dry rub of Chinese spices like star anise and licorice to the cavity`, then fill it with `a mixture of onions, garlic and celery`. The turkeys, like ducks, are then `skewered up to close` the cavity, `scalded with hot water to tighten the skin` and clean off any `seasoning mixture, coated in vinegar`, and hung to dry for 12 hours
对于他们的热销火鸡，郑氏兄弟将八角和甘草等中国香料干擦在火鸡腔内壁，再用洋葱、大蒜和芹菜的混合物填满火鸡腔。然后，把火鸡像鸭子一样串起，合上腔体，用热水烫一下，收紧鸡皮，清理掉任何调料混合物，涂上醋，挂起来晾12个小时

To `further set themselves apart from` other Chinese barbecue restaurants in the area, Eric Cheung created a Southern-style `cream gravy to go with their turkey, using the necks, gizzards and liver` ― a twist he said `was inspired by his fondness` for chicken-fried steak at places like IHOP
为了进一步将自己与该地区其他中国烧烤餐厅区分开来，埃里克・郑用鸡脖、胗和肝制作了一道南方风味的奶油肉汁来搭配他们的火鸡――他说，这一变化的灵感来自于他喜欢吃的IHOP等餐厅的炸鸡排

For Hing Lung’s customers, who are `predominantly Chinese-American`, the turkey `strikes a balance`, allowing them to `assimilate to American holiday conventions without sacrificing their tastes`. After all, what could be more American than `having things your way?`
对于以美籍华人为主的兴隆的顾客而言，火鸡实现了一种平衡，让他们在不牺牲口感的同时融入美国的节日习俗。毕竟，还有什么比随心所欲更具美国特色呢?

American turkey can also be hard to `cook well. Prone to bland, dry breast meat and blackened wing tips`, the bulky bird is a challenge for home cooks all over
而且美国火鸡也很难做好。大块头的火鸡容易做出淡而干燥的胸脯肉和变黑的翼尖，对所有的家庭厨师来说都是一个挑战

Many `were totally unaccustomed to` using their ovens, `let alone for such a large bird`, so they asked the restaurant for help. (Ovens are not a typical feature of home kitchens in China, and most Chinese home cooking occurs `on the stovetop`.)
许多人完全不习惯使用他们的烤箱，更不用说这么大的鸡，于是他们向餐厅求助。(烤箱并非中国家庭厨房的典型配置，大多数中国家庭烹饪都在灶台上进行。)

Their recipe has also `gradually changed to adapt to the oversize bird`. They started out with `a standard five-spice seasoning` based on their roast duck, but found it wasn’t enough to `flavor whole turkeys`, which have a much higher ratio of meat to skin and bone. They added ginger and `cilantro` to the inside-brine mixture, and `boosted the overall seasoning` so it was stronger.
他们的食谱也逐渐改变，以便适应这种超大禽类。他们一开始用的是适合烤鸭的标准五香调料，但发现这不足以给整只火鸡调味，因为和鸭子相比，它们肉多，皮和骨头少。他们在卤汁中加入生姜和香菜，提高整体调味效果，使其更加浓郁。

Bryan Cardenas, who is not of `Chinese descent`, has been `serving Sun Wah’s turkey` at Thanksgiving for more than a decade. He has also `incorporated Chinese flavors into` his holiday cooking, `tinkering with dishes` like his fresh cranberry sauce. “I added `a tablespoon` of Chinese five-spice,” he said. “`It was out of this world.”`
布莱恩・卡德纳斯不是华裔，十多年来，他感恩节吃的一直是新华供应的火鸡。他还将中国风味融入到自己的假日烹饪中，用他自己的新鲜蔓越莓酱等菜式进行小小修改。“我加了一大勺中国五香粉，”他说。“感觉太棒了。”

But no one particularly cared if it was good or not: “The only reason we wanted her to cook it was to `make congee` the next day,” Ms. Cheng said `with a laugh.`
但是没有人特别在意它是好是坏：“我们想让她做的唯一原因就是第二天可以做粥，”郑文彩笑着说

“It’s such `an ingrained part` of American culture that we wanted to bring home, but to my parents, it was still `completely foreign` to them,” said Andrew Shiue, the Chinese-American writer behind the blog Beyond Chinatown. “We wanted to `take part in this American tradition`.”
“这是美国文化中根深蒂固的一部分，我们想把它带回家，但这对我的父母来说还是完全陌生的，”博客“城里城外”的博主，华裔美国作家薛唯中(Andrew Shiue)说。“我们想加入这个美国传统。”

Wilson Tang, the owner of Nom Wah `Tea Parlor` in Manhattan’s Chinatown, said his family `dabbled in roasting turkey` at home when he was growing up, with results that were `“hit or miss.”`
曼哈顿华埠南华茶室(Nom Wah Tea Parlor)的老板邓伟说，在他小时候，他的家人曾在家里尝试烤火鸡，最终结果如何要“看运气”。

Yee Li, on nearby Bayard Street, became his family’s `go-to source`. The meat was `moister` than American-style turkey, Mr. Tang said, and the shop would also `carve the turkey in neat pieces`, just like a roast duck or `soy-sauce chicken.`
附近摆也街上的裕利肉铺(Yee Li)是他家购买火鸡的主要去处。邓伟说，那里的肉比美式火鸡多汁，而且店家还会把火鸡切成整齐的小块，就像烤鸭或豉油鸡一样。

Although Yee Li closed this year after more than 30 years on Bayard Street, John Chan, `a scion of `the family that had owned the shop, opened New Yee Li in January in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, `filling a niche for classic Cantonese roast meats and other specialties` in an area with a growing population of Chinese immigrants.
裕利在摆也街上经营了30多年，于今年关门歇业，其所有者的后裔约翰・陈于1月在布鲁克林的戴克高地开了新裕利(New Yee Li)，用传统粤式烤肉和其他特色菜填补这个中国移民人口不断增长地区的小市场。

Quick, who is your favorite president? Is it Abraham Lincoln? Well, you’ll never believe this but Tom Hanks `is related to him`. The `maiden name` of Lincoln’s mother, Nancy, was Hanks, and yes, it’s the same Hanks.
问一下，你最喜欢的总统是？是亚伯拉罕・林肯吗？你绝对不会相信，汤姆・汉克斯和他是亲戚。林肯母亲南希的娘家姓是汉克斯，没错，就是这个汉克斯。

Once, in 2015, he `stopped by a table` of Girl Scout Cookies and bought some boxes, donated an additional $20, then `offered selfies to passersby as an enticement to buy`. That same year, he found a young woman’s student ID in a park and used `his charming Twitter feed`, which is filled with found items, to get it back to her
有一次，2015年，他在一个女童子军饼干摊前驻足，买了几盒饼干，又捐了20美元，然后向路人提供合影机会，吸引他们买饼干。同一年，他在公园里捡到一个女孩的学生证，他利用他那招人喜爱的Twitter账号――里面有各种遗失物品的照片――把证件还给了她

“People have said that Tom is `Hollywood’s Everyman`; that he’s this generation’s Jimmy Stewart or Gary Cooper. But he’s just Tom Hanks. And that’s enough. `That’s more than enough`.” Two years later, Obama gave him `the Presidential Medal of Freedom.`
“人们说汤姆是好莱坞的普通人；他是这一代人的吉米・斯图尔特或加里・库珀。但他只是汤姆・汉克斯。这就足够了。已经太够了。”两年后，奥巴马授予汉克斯总统自由勋章。

That does not really ever happen, an actor waiting for me ahead of `the appointed time, versus clearly dreading me two hours past it`. “I think a long time ago, I learned how important it was to `show up a little bit early`,” Hanks told me. “`Be ready to go`, you know? And to respect the whole process, and I think that you could respect the whole process `even when` the other people don’t.”
这种事真是前所未有，一个演员在约定时间之前等我，而不是用迟到两小时来威吓我。“我想很久以前，我就知道早到是多么重要，”汉克斯告诉我。“做好准备，对吧？尊重整个过程，我认为你可以尊重整个过程，即使其他人不是那么尊重。”

`In the panels after the premiere`, some of the questions seemed to be based on `the notion` that Tom Hanks is so wonderful and Mister Rogersy that he just had to show up and read some lines since hey, they’re both `essentially the same: easygoing nice men` with graying hair.
在首映式后的座谈上，有些问题似乎是基于这样一种观念：汤姆・汉克斯太棒了，他只要一出场、说几句台词就是罗杰斯先生，因为，嘿，他们的本质是一样的：随和、友善、头发花白的男人。

He is `most often cast in roles` that need what Robert Zemeckis (who directed “Forrest Gump,” among other Hanks movies) calls “that `classic Everyman quality`.” Over my reporting, many, many people told me what an Everyman he is.
他最常饰演的那些角色都需要《阿甘正传》的导演罗伯特・泽米基斯所说的那种“经典的普通人品质”。在我做采访期间，很多很多人告诉我，汉克斯是一个普通人。

He `was never angry at` his parents; he’s still not. He saw `how hard it was for them to function`. They never explained things to him. Now he knows, “it’s because they didn’t `have the verbiage`. They didn’t `have the vocabulary`. And they `were so racked with self-loathing and guilt and et cetera`, all that stuff that `went along`, and there were four of us, for God’s sake, and they just, you know, couldn’t do it. Now, I’ve got four kids myself, and as soon as you start having your own kids, you go, like, oh, I get it.”
他从不生父母的气；现在依然没有。他明白他们很难尽到父母的职责。他们从不向他解释任何事情。现在他明白了，“那是因为他们没法长篇大论。他们无话可说。他们被自憎和内疚这些东西折磨得痛苦不堪，所有这些都随之而来，有四个孩子，看在上帝的份上，他们就是做不到。现在，我自己也有了四个孩子，当你自己有了孩子的时候，你会说，哦，我明白了。”

He remembers Oprah once asked him on her show about `his dysfunctional family growing up`, and he thought, “`What’s that? Oh, that’s us.`”
他记得奥普拉曾经在节目中问他，在不正常的家庭成长是什么样的感受，他想，“什么意思？噢，是说我们。”
