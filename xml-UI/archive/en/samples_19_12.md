We `make no promise to renounce` the use of force and `reserve the option` of taking `all necessary means`
我们不承诺放弃使用武力，保留采取一切必要措施的选项

“We don’t need a real war to resolve the Taiwan question. The mainland can `adopt various measures` to make Taiwan ruled by the Democratic Progressive Party `turn into a Lebanon situation` which ‘Taiwan independence’ forces `cannot afford`.” Meaning: The Chinese government believes it can `pit various ethnic, political and social groups in Taiwan against one another`
“台海问题不需要通过一场真正的战争来解决，但大陆可以有各种手段将民进党统治的台湾‘黎巴嫩化’，给予‘台独’势力无法承受的打击。”意思是：中国政府认为它可以让台湾的各个民族、政治和社会团体互相斗争

But the deterioration of Russian-American `relations pales in comparison to` the rise in Sino-American `antagonism that has unfolded` over the past couple of years
但是，与过去几年来不断升级的中美对抗相比，俄美关系的恶化相形见绌

Their memories of the original might include `near-Armageddon experiences`, such the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, and multiple conventional wars fought in countries from Vietnam to El Salvador. But there is no obvious reason Cold War II should `feature nuclear brinkmanship or proxy wars`
他们对冷战的记忆可能包括接近世界末日的体验，比如1962年的古巴导弹危机，以及在好几个国家的常规战争，从越南到萨尔瓦多。但没有明显的理由表明，第二次冷战应该以核边缘政策或代理人战争为特征

Back then, there was also `a political benefit`. Once `the spasm of McCarthyism had passed`, as Americans `came to a consensus` that they all `faced a common foe, domestic divisions decreased notably`
那时还有一个政治上的好处。麦卡锡主义的发作过去之后，随着美国人对他们面临一个共同敌人达成共识，国内的分歧明显减少

It would be `nothing short of disastrous` if China won the race for quantum supremacy, which could `render all conventional computer encryption obsolete`
如果中国赢得了量子霸权的竞赛，那将是一场灾难，它将淘汰所有传统的计算机加密技术

Nevertheless, I do expect this new Cold War to get colder, even if Mr. Trump `attempts a thaw` in the form of a trade deal with China. The American president might have been the catalyst behind `the big chill`, but `it’s not something he can just undo when he pleases`
然而，我的确预计这场新冷战会变得更冷，即使特朗普试图通过与中国达成贸易协议的形式来解冻。这位美国总统可能是制造这场大寒潮的催化剂，但冷战不是他可以想停就停的事情

Earlier this fall, he `hinted that` a deal was `near completion, signaling that` the trade war could be `winding down.`
今天秋天早些时候，他暗示一项协议已经接近完成，给出贸易战可能会结束的信号。

The president’s `affinity for using unpredictability` as a negotiating tactic has `angered trading partners` and at times `roiled financial markets `
总统喜欢使用不可预测性作为一种谈判策略，这激怒了贸易伙伴，有时还扰乱了金融市场

`In some ways` I like the idea of waiting until after the election for the China deal, But they want to make a deal now, and we’ll `see whether or not the deal’s going to be right. It’s got to be right.`
在某种程度上，我想要等到选举之后再与中国达成贸易协定，但他们要现在就达成协定，我们会考虑协定是不是合适。必须合适才行

Member states are expected to `maintain robust military spending`, but they do not `pay dues`
成员国应维持强劲的军事开支，但它们不缴纳会费

The events of recent days seem to have `put an end` to weeks of `relative calm and record highs` in the stock market
最近几天的事件似乎将会终结数周以来的相对平静和股市破纪录的高涨

It is `remarkable` how President Trump `seems impervious to the delicate state` of an `economic expansion` that is clearly `long in the tooth`
经济增长显然已经成为过去，特朗普总统似乎对这种微妙的状态无动于衷，这是很不同寻常的

The tariffs continue to hurt U.S. businesses, workers and consumers and are `a substantial drag on the U.S. economy`
关税不断给美国企业、工人以及消费者带来伤害，并严重拖累了美国经济

Any deal reached now will `be subject to scrutiny` for the next 12 months and the `harsh disinfectant of sunlight` during the `general election cycle`, Trade wars are political ― right now, President Trump has the benefit of widespread bipartisan U.S. voter opposition to China and `a robust consumer spending cycle`.
现在达成的任何协议在接下来12个月都会受到详细审视，在大选周期中，暴露在众目之下是非常严酷的, 贸易战是政治性的，现在美国两党选民都普遍反对中国，而且消费支出处于强劲的周期，这些都对特朗普总统有益

Mr. Trump’s `trademark volatility` was `on full display` Tuesday
周二，特朗普标志性的多变展现得淋漓尽致

At one point, he said he would not `settle for an “even” agreement` with China ― only one that `favored` the United States
他一度表示不会跟中国达成“均等”的协议，只能达成对美国有益的协议

Mr. Ross said that the agreement `in principle` that Mr. Trump promoted in October `was at the “40,000-foot level,”`
罗斯说，特朗普10月推动的原则上的协议处在“4万英尺高的水平”（指其非常笼统――译注）

We don’t `have a breakthrough` until it’s `in black and white, on paper ― signed, sealed and delivered`
直到用白纸黑字写下来，签字、确认、兑现协议，才算是取得突破

Because `once the election occurs` ― and the president `seems to be in very good shape` for the election ― once it occurs and `he’s back in`, now that’s `no longer a distraction` that can `detract from our negotiating position`
总统的选举状态似乎还不错，一旦选举发生，等他回来之后，选举就不再会是分散我们注意力、损害我们谈判地位的因素了

The Chinese `technology powerhouse`, is challenging the Federal Communications Commission in court for `choking off its sales` in the United States, the latest in `the besieged company’s widening efforts to hit back` at regulators and critics `across the globe`
中国科技巨头华为正向联邦通信委员会发起挑战，这是这家备受困扰的公司回击全球监管机构和批评人士的广泛努力中的最新举措

Large wireless providers such as Verizon and AT&T `have long shunned the companies’ gear`. But `carriers in remote, rural parts` of the United States have depended on it for years
诸如Verizon和AT&T这样的大型无线供应商长期以来一直回避他们的设备。但是，美国偏远农村地区的运营商多年来一直依赖这两家公司的设备

The Trump administration has `led an all-out effort` to keep Huawei, the world’s largest supplier of telecom equipment, out of wireless networks in the United States and globally
特朗普政府正竭力让全球最大的电信设备供应商华为脱离美国和全球的无线网络系统

They want to show their customers in the U.S. that `they’re a serious company, that they’re not an outlaw`
他们想向美国的顾客表明，他们是一家正经的公司，不是非法的

Huawei is `embarking upon this new legal battle at a moment when`, despite `the onslaught` from Washington and `apprehension` in other world capitals, the company’s `fortunes appear to be looking up`
在华为开始这场新的法律斗争时，尽管遭受了来自华盛顿的猛烈打击，以及来自世界其他首府的忧虑，但该公司的际遇似乎正在不断转好

In Washington, Huawei has `spent $1.9 million on lobbying so far this year`, according to federal disclosures, `dwarfing its past totals`
根据联邦政府的披露，在华盛顿，今年迄今为止，华为在游说方面的支出为190万美元，这使它过去的总支出相形见绌

Huawei has also `filed libel complaints` in France against a researcher of the Foundation for Strategic Research, `a think tank` in Paris. After Huawei’s complaint against Ms. Niquet `came to light last month`, the Foundation for Strategic Research said it supported its researchers’ `right to free expression`
华为还在法国对巴黎一家智库“战略研究基金会”的研究员倪雅玲提起了诽谤诉讼, 在上个月华为对倪雅玲的诉讼曝光后，战略研究基金会表示支持其研究人员的言论自由权

`The anger on social media` was also `indicative of new insecurity` among members of China’s middle class, who have never `experienced an economic downturn` and have always thought they had more protections than `lower-paid migrant workers`
社交媒体上的愤怒也显示出中国中产阶级成员新的不安全感，他们从未经历过经济衰退，而且一直以为自己比低收入的农民工得到了更多保护

Huawei has the right, and `in fact a duty`, to report the facts of any `suspected illegal conduct` to authorities. We `respect the decisions made by the authorities`, If Li Hongyuan believes that he has `suffered damages or that his rights have been infringed`, we support his right to `seek satisfaction through legal means, up to and including lawsuit` against Huawei
华为有权利，也有义务，并基于事实对于涉嫌违法的行为向司法机关举报。如果认为他的权益受到了损害，华为支持他运用法律武器维护自己的权益，包括起诉华为

The elephant `stepped on you`, but you can step back on it. Once a company `becomes a cold, dehumanized grinding machine`, what’s the point for it to exist?
大象踩你一脚，你可以踩回去. 一旦强化成了一种去人性化的、冰冷的碾压机器，那么所谓企业存在的意义又究竟在哪里

Huawei `cultivated an aggressive “wolf culture”` that encouraged its employees to work extremely hard
华为曾培养一种咄咄逼人的“狼性文化”，鼓励员工拼命工作

`A Chinese banquet` can be many things, but it is never `a gastronomic occasion.`
中国的饭局可以各种各样，但绝对和美食无关

All business meetings `end up in` private dining rooms, `employing pork and chicken as icebreakers` and closing deals over dumplings and rice
所有的商务会议最后都在餐厅包间里结束，猪肉和鸡肉可以用来打破僵局，吃着饺子和米饭可以做成生意

`The most prominent guest gets the “upper seat`,” the one squarely facing the entrance, so `his authority is appreciated` as soon as a guest arrives. Opposite the upper seat, in the chair closest to the doorway, is the so-called manager, the one who sends out invitations, orders dishes, arranges the seating, urges people to drink more and then `shoves the drunks into taxis afterward`
最重要的客人坐“上座”，也就是正对着包间门的座位，其他客人到来时，一眼就能看出他的权威。上座的对面，也就是离门最近的那把椅子留给管事儿的人，他负责发邀请、点菜、安排座位、劝酒，然后把醉汉送进出租车

“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” he said. “`I’ve been looking forward to meeting you for a long time`.”
“幸会、幸会，”他说。“久仰大名，如雷贯耳。”

Those in this seat can `expect to receive`: an absurd amount of `secondhand smoke`; a number of `judgmental looks` from men and women around the table; `inexhaustible baijiu refills` and, occasionally, a squeeze on the shoulder or a hand on the back
坐在这个位子上的人可能会收到：多得离谱的二手烟；桌边男男女女们的上下打量；永远喝不完的白酒续杯，以及肩膀上偶尔的一捏，或落在背上的手

Yet she pushed on, `shot after shot, knocking back baijiu` as the critics and editors `cheered like a mob`.
但她仍在继续，把一杯杯的白酒喝下去，那些评论家和编辑们像暴民似地为她大声叫好

The ultimate purpose of a banquet is to get its diners drunk. Only in this way can we connect and become friends, squeeze each other’s shoulders and `make dirty jokes`
饭局的最终目的是把用餐者灌醉。只有大家都醉了，才能建立关系，成为朋友，互捏肩膀，讲荤笑话

Once this became apparent, the president `sat in boredom`, picking at vegetables in his bowl, `sipping buckwheat tea`. Around half an hour later, he ordered and ate some noodles and took his leave
这一切变得明朗之后，社长无聊地坐在那里，用筷子在自己的碗里挑来挑去，喝着荞麦茶。大约半小时后，他要了碗面条，吃完就走了

But that was before everything changed ― before China `emerged as a textile powerhouse, undercutting local businesses`
但那是之前――中国成为纺织强国，本地企业被削弱之前；她和她的同事失业之前

Despite its `Marxist trappings and solidarity with` the Soviet Union, the Italian Communist Party was never `devoted to the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism`. It was `left wing` in the same way as Nordic countries like Sweden, its leaders `intent on equitably distributing the gains of economic growth`
尽管有马克思主义的外表，且和苏联保持了一致，意大利共产党从未致力于革命推翻资本主义。它的左翼性质与瑞典等北欧国家一样，其领导人意在公平分配经济增长的收益

They `could govern by promising good salaries`, a pension system and health care. When there was `an expansive economy`, the left was strong, because the left offers you jobs
他们可以通过承诺高薪、养老金制度和医保来治理。当经济增长时，左派力量强大，因为左派提供了就业

Critics say the council, which `is stacked with conservative figures` and unable to `summon witnesses, is toothless`
批评人士说，主要由保守派人士组成的监警会无法传唤证人，没有实权

The whole incident has become `an international laughingstock`, seeking foreign expertise could `rationalize their irrational state of affairs`, but now the `opposite has happened`.
整件事成为一个国际笑话, 把外国专家找来可以使没有道理的情况合理化，但现在发生了相反的事情

TikTok has become `a hotbed of talent`, and there’s `so much discoverability` on the platform that it can be used as this mechanism to discover new voices
TikTok已经成为人才的温床，在这个平台上有很多可发现的东西，可以用来作为发现新声音的机制

You don’t need a single follower on the app to `have a video blow up`. You just need to `tap into the right trend`, or do the right dance at the right time
不需要有任何关注者，你的视频也能火爆。你只需要跟上正确的潮流，或者在适当的时候跳个适当的舞

Anyone can `have a viral moment`. Often we see creators take a topic and `put their own spin on it` and it really does have this `viral effect`. Because TikTok tends to `lower the barrier of entry`, creation is really being `democratized`
任何人都能有一个走红时刻。我们常常看到创作者选择一个主题，对其加上他们自己的解释，其结果真的有这种走红效应。因为TikTok往往会降低进入的门槛，所以创造真正地民主化了

For me, `what’s been interesting` is that now anyone can become a creator. People are owning their own voice, not having to `express a polished version` of themselves. When you look at other platforms there’s different versions of yourself you’re `putting out there`, TikTok is about being yourself, `warts and all`, and this new generation of creators is really embracing that
对我来说有趣的是，现在任何人都可以成为创造者。人们为自己发声，不需要去表达一个包装过的自己。在其他平台上，你会放上不同版本的自己，而TikTok就是要让你做自己，毫无遮掩，而新一代的创作者真的很喜欢这一点

I think as `a platform of scale` you can’t not think about these things today and there’s `a level of responsibility` we have to take on
我认为作为一个如此规模的平台，如今你没法不去思考这些事，我们要承担起一定的责任

We want to make sure we’re `safeguarding` our users from things like misinformation. We have a number of things we’re `beefing up`: our policies, ensuring we have `expert moderators` who know how to define that type of content, what is misinformation, and ensuring we have the technology `in place` to scan for things like coordinated abuse. We’re `looking across` the industry and looking at what we can learn from
我们想要确保，我们可以保护用户不受虚假信息等问题的伤害。我们有很多方面正在加强：我们的政策，确保我们有专业的懂得辨别这类内容的版主，什么是虚假信息，并确保我们拥有技术来审查诸如协作虐待之类的行为。我们观察整个行业并寻找可以学到的东西

This is something that I want to `wholeheartedly stress`: We do not censor any content based on political sensitivities
这是我要真心诚意强调的：我们不会基于政治敏感性审查任何内容

Our president `holds the ultimate public trust`, When he `betrays that trust and puts himself before country`, he endangers the Constitution, he endangers our democracy, and he endangers our national security.
我们的总统拥有最大的公众信任，当他背叛这种信任、把自己置于国家之上时，他就危及了宪法，危及了我们的民主，危及了我们的国家安全

The Trump administration is `sending mixed signals` on delaying them as the United States and China `keep haggling over a trade deal`
在中美继续就贸易协议的达成讨价还价之际，特朗普政府发出了推迟征税的含糊信号

We’re still `in a high-stakes poker game`, Having another round of tariffs would be `a poison pill in the context of` the current U.S.-China negotiations, and in the context of the global economy
我们仍在玩一场下重注的扑克, 在当前的美中谈判以及全球经济背景下，再来一轮关税无异于下毒

a Hudson Institute scholar who advises Mr. Trump, `drafted a memo that has been circulated to` the White House `outlining possible actions`
哈德逊研究所学者起草了一份备忘录，概述了有可能采取的行动，并已提交给白宫

The two sides were `in constant contact` and that an agreement should not be `sidetracked by an “arbitrary” deadline`
双方一致保持着紧密联系，并且贸易协议不能被一个“随意”的期限喧宾夺主

Negotiations have `centered on` whether the United States would lift the tariffs it has imposed since September, or whether it might `slash the overall rate` for all or some of the tariffs in effect ― for example reducing the existing tax on China `by half`
谈判的焦点是美国是否将取消自9月以来征收的关税，或者是否可能将现行的所有或部分关税的整体税率下调――例如将现有的对华税收减半

Any tariff cuts were `left for later phases`, an arrangement that `was assailed` in China as `too favorable` to the United States
任何降低关税的措施都留在了以后阶段，中方抨击这种处理太偏向美国一方

But China has `been wary of offering` further concessions to `offset a tariff rollback`. That has `stymied negotiators at least temporarily`
但中国不太愿意通过进一步的妥协来补偿关税回滚。这至少短期内束缚了谈判人员的手脚

`A rolling rumbling mass of ash tumbled over the cliff face`, in all directions, and it completely `engulfed the island`, It `cut out the sun`, it went dark. You couldn’t see that there was an island there. It was completely covered in ash
一团团火山灰轰鸣着从悬崖跌落，向各个方向翻滚，淹没了整个岛，它遮住了阳光，天暗下来。你都看不出那里有过小岛。它完全被火山灰覆盖了

There has to be more respect for nature. We `can’t assume` we can access anything we want, This is something policymakers and the public need to consider. Even though this is such a great place, should we be allowing people to go `in such large numbers?`
必须给大自然更多尊重。我们不能以为我们可以去任何想要去的地方, 这是政策制定者和公众需要考虑的事情。即使这个地方很棒，我们是否应该允许人们大量涌入

Already, locals `are concerned about` the effect the eruption will have on the community as questions of disclosure and `negligence swirl`
由于信息公开和玩忽职守问题的浮现，当地人已经开始担心火山喷发对社区的影响

Around 70 percent of the volcano `sits under` the water, and tourists walk into its crater and `up to the lip` of its crater lake, `peering into` its cavity to see its `endlessly boiling core`
约70%的火山位于水下，游客走进火山口一直到火山湖口的边缘，凝视火山内部不断沸腾的核心

You’re walking into `this enclosed amphitheater`, onto the floor of a very active volcano where there are `steaming gas vents`, where there are crater lakes filled with hot water close to `boiling temperatures`
进入这个封闭的圆形剧场，走在非常活跃的火山表面，那里有蒸腾的气口，因为那里的火山湖充满了接近沸腾的热水

`That tells you` there’s a source of heat under the volcano that is constantly supplying hot gasses and heating up fluids under the molten rock or magma, Basically you have `this hot cooker system` at constant high temperature and high pressure that could explode at any time
这意味着在火山下有一个持续提供热气的热源，它在加热熔融岩石或岩浆下的流体，基本上来说，这就像一个持续高温高压的锅炉系统，随时可能爆炸

`Gas masks` help you get near `roaring steam vents`, `bubbling pits of mud`, hot volcanic streams and the amazing lake of `steaming acid`. And `the vivid hues` of yellow and orange `resulting from all sulfur on` the island make for remarkable photos, so have your camera ready
防毒面具可以帮你到达咆哮的蒸汽喷口、冒泡的泥坑、炙热的岩浆，和惊艳的酸性火山湖。岛上大量的硫磺所产生的鲜艳的黄色和橙色构成绝佳的影像，准备好你的相机

I was going to buy one of those tours for `my in-laws` for Christmas
我本来打算出钱让公公婆婆圣诞节到这里来旅行

`The ideological confrontation` between the United States and China `has sharpened` 
美国与中国的意识形态冲突已经加剧

`“Hide our capacities and bide our time,”` advised Deng Xiaoping
邓小平曾提出要“韬光养晦”

Institutions `upholding the law` fought back in 2019 against leaders who believed that they `were above it`. 
维护法律的机构在2019年对那些认为自己凌驾于法律之上的领导人进行了反击

President Trump is facing impeachment in the House of Representatives on charges of `abuse of power and obstruction of Congress`. He has responded to the whole process `with cries of “lynching”` and called the Democrats “crazy.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu `was indicted on` corruption charges. He dismissed the accusations as `a “coup.”`
特朗普正面临众议院的弹劾，罪名是滥用权力和妨碍国会调查。他对整个程序的回应是大喊自己受了“私刑”，称民主党人“疯了”。以色列总理本雅明・内塔尼亚胡被控腐败，受到起诉。他将这些指控斥为“政变”

His foreign policy is `laughably erratic`
他的外交政策反复无常到可笑的程度

President Trump will `almost certainly escape conviction` in the Senate and remain in office to fight in the November 2020 election. Mr. Netanyahu may yet `wriggle out of his legal corner`. For both men, `clinging to power` has become `something more than` a political struggle. It is `a desperate attempt` to stay out of jail.
几乎可以肯定，特朗普会逃脱被参议院判定有罪，从而继续留任，参加2020年11月的总统竞选。内塔尼亚胡也许还未摆脱他的法律困境。对这两人来说，抓住权力不放已不仅仅是一场政治斗争，而是一种要逃脱牢狱之灾的不顾一切的努力

To be evil you have to be `focused and purposeful`. Much of Mr. Trump’s behavior is `inconsistent and inconsequential`. Still, it is damaging
够得上邪恶的人必须专注且有目的。特朗普的很多行为不一致且微不足道。尽管如此，他的行为仍具有破坏性

Mr. Trump `is a symptom, not a cause`. A decade ago, the world `was mired in` the global financial crisis. Those responsible walked away. `Insurrection` today is `the child of impunity and inequity`
特朗普只是一种症状，不是病因. 10年前，世界陷入了全球金融危机的泥潭。那些对此负有责任的人逃之夭夭。今天的造反是有罪不罚和不公平的产物

Behind Mr. Imamoglu’s desk `hung a portrait of` Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey’s `secular republic.` 
伊马姆奥卢的办公桌后面挂着穆斯塔法・凯末尔・阿塔图尔克的画像，他是现代土耳其世俗共和国的创始人。

It had just been `rehung`. Followers of Mr. Erdogan, `an anti-secular leader with dreams of` a restored Ottoman Empire, had earlier removed it. 
画像刚被重新挂上。埃尔多安的追随者以前把画像摘了下来。埃尔多安是一名反世俗的领导人，梦想着重建奥斯曼帝国

The portrait’s `back-and-forth struck me as an image of` a world `hovering between autocracy and resistance`
这幅画像的摘与挂让我猛然想到，这是一个徘徊在专制和反抗之间的世界的象征

China’s companies `racked up some towering bills` as they expanded, and the world’s investors and lenders `rushed to offer` them even more money
中国企业在扩张中积攒了如山的债务，而全世界的投资和借贷者也争相给它们送去更多的资金

Now the bills are `coming due`, and a growing number of Chinese companies can’t `pay up`, `in a sign that` the world’s No. 2 economy is `feeling the stress` from its worst slowdown in nearly three decades
如今，账单即将到期，越来越多的中国企业无法偿还贷款，显示全球第二大经济体正感受到30年来最严重经济放缓的压力

Chinese corporate borrowers have `defaulted` on nearly $20 billion in loans this year
中国企业借方今年已经出现近200亿美元的债务违约

The amount is small compared with China’s overall economy, but `the toll is rising`
与中国整体经济相比，这个数字很小，但是造成的损害正在上升

But Beijing has `shown a greater willingness to` let companies `go insolvent` to teach them a lesson about borrowing too much, and many local governments now `lack the funds to help their hometown champions`
但中国政府已表现出更多让企业破产的意愿，以此教训它们不要过度借贷，而许多地方政府现在缺乏资金来帮助本地的龙头企业

It’s quite `a hairy situation`, Many investors expected Tewoo would `at least pay off its offshore debt`
情况相当棘手,许多投资者原本预计天津物产集团至少会偿还其海外债务

Two years ago, officials began to `tackle the mess`. They `clamped down on an unruly shadow banking sector`, where `murky platforms` linked borrowers with lenders willing to hand over money in exchange for `big returns`
两年前，官员们开始着手解决这个问题。他们取缔了不守规则的影子银行产业，在这样的银行中，不透明的平台将借款人与愿意用金钱换取巨额回报的贷款人联系在一起

They allowed more bankruptcies, hoping to send a message that companies that `spend recklessly` will be allowed to fail
还允许更多的公司破产，希望传递出这样一个信息：肆意挥霍的公司是可以垮掉的

But regulators are `walking a tightrope`. Slowing lending has `contributed to faltering economic growth`. Beijing continues to look for ways to `pour fresh money into the financial system` even as it tries to `clean up the mess` left behind by some of its biggest borrowers
但监管机构此举无异于走钢丝。贷款放缓导致经济增长乏力。北京仍在寻找向金融体系注入新资金的途径，同时也在努力清理一些最大的借贷者留下的烂摊子

Previously you could `roll over the bond repayment`,but when `uncertainty is heightened`, then people are `less willing to give you leeway`
以前你可以将债券展期，但当不确定性上升时，人们就不太愿意给你回旋的余地

Macmillan Press published a book by `a relatively obscure British Treasury official` who had resigned from the government `in protest over the Versailles treaty` that brought `the epochal trauma` of the First World War to its conclusion
麦克米伦出版社出版了一本书，作者是一位相对无名的英国财政部官员，为抗议结束了第一次世界大战划时代创伤的《凡尔赛和约》，他辞去了政府职务

The book, “The Economic Consequences of the Peace,” `turned out to be a phenomenon`. It `swiftly went through six printings`
结果，《〈凡尔赛和约〉的经济后果》获得了巨大成功。很快就印刷了六次

His `incisive, candid portrayals` of the peacemakers reflected the `no-holds-barred influence` of Lytton Strachey’s recently celebrated “Eminent Victorians.”
他对和平缔造者入木三分的、坦率的刻画，反映了Lytton Strachey不久前广受关注的《维多利亚时代四名人传》一书不加约束写法的影响

Keynes’s book is `essentially correct` with regard to its most `important arguments`
凯恩斯的书在其最重要的论点上，基本上是正确的

Keynes `was sounding an alarm` about `the fragility` of the European order
凯恩斯是在对欧洲秩序的脆弱性发出警告

Keynes argued that while many Europeans were celebrating a new era in the continent’s economy, `too much of what emerged` from the war `rested on longstanding, underappreciated and elaborately enmeshed networks and foundations`
凯恩斯认为，尽管许多欧洲人都在庆祝欧洲大陆经济的新纪元，但战后出现的东西中有太多是建立在存在已久、未得到充分认识、精心编织的网络和基础之上的

`Reconstituting` the general economic order, not `exacting shortsighted retribution`, was `the imperative` of the day
重建广义的经济秩序，而不是短视地施加报复，才是当时的当务之急
