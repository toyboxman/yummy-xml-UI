我们不承诺放弃使用武力，保留采取一切必要措施的选项

“We don’t need a real war to resolve the Taiwan question.

Older readers will probably regard another Cold War as a bad idea. Their memories of the original might include `near-Armageddon experiences`, such the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, and multiple conventional wars fought in countries from Vietnam to El Salvador. But there is no obvious reason Cold War II should `feature nuclear brinkmanship or proxy wars`
年纪大点的读者可能会认为，再打一场冷战是个坏主意。他们对冷战的记忆可能包括接近世界末日的体验，比如1962年的古巴导弹危机，以及在好几个国家的常规战争，从越南到萨尔瓦多。但没有明显的理由表明，第二次冷战应该以核边缘政策或代理人战争为特征

然而，我的确预计这场新冷战会变得更冷，即使特朗普试图通过与中国达成贸易协议的形式来解冻。这位美国总统可能是制造这场大寒潮的催化剂，但冷战不是他可以想停就停的事情

Earlier this fall, he `hinted that` a deal was `near completion, signaling that` the trade war could be `winding down.`

The president’s `affinity for using unpredictability` as a negotiating tactic has `angered trading partners` and at times `roiled financial markets `
总统喜欢使用不可预测性作为一种谈判策略，这激怒了贸易伙伴，有时还扰乱了金融市场

`In some ways` I like the idea of waiting until after the election for the China deal, But they want to make a deal now, and we’ll `see whether or not the deal’s going to be right. It’s got to be right.`
在某种程度上，我想要等到选举之后再与中国达成贸易协定，但他们要现在就达成协定，我们会考虑协定是不是合适。必须合适才行

现在达成的任何协议在接下来12个月都会受到详细审视，在大选周期中，暴露在众目之下是非常严酷的, 贸易战是政治性的，现在美国两党选民都普遍反对中国，而且消费支出处于强劲的周期，这些都对特朗普总统有益

Mr. Trump’s `trademark volatility` was `on full display` Tuesday
周二，特朗普标志性的多变展现得淋漓尽致

At one point, he said he would not `settle for an “even” agreement` with China ― only one that `favored` the United States

总统的选举状态似乎还不错，一旦选举发生，等他回来之后，选举就不再会是分散我们注意力、损害我们谈判地位的因素了

华为还在法国对巴黎一家智库“战略研究基金会”的研究员倪雅玲提起了诽谤诉讼, 在上个月华为对倪雅玲的诉讼曝光后，战略研究基金会表示支持其研究人员的言论自由权

`The most prominent guest gets the “upper seat`,” the one squarely facing the entrance, so `his authority is appreciated` as soon as a guest arrives. Opposite the upper seat, in the chair closest to the doorway, is the so-called manager, the one who sends out invitations, orders dishes, arranges the seating, urges people to drink more and then `shoves the drunks into taxis afterward`
最重要的客人坐“上座”，也就是正对着包间门的座位，其他客人到来时，一眼就能看出他的权威。上座的对面，也就是离门最近的那把椅子留给管事儿的人，他负责发邀请、点菜、安排座位、劝酒，然后把醉汉送进出租车

It was `left wing` in the same way as Nordic countries like Sweden, its leaders `intent on equitably distributing the gains of economic growth`
尽管有马克思主义的外表，且和苏联保持了一致，意大利共产党从未致力于革命推翻资本主义。它的左翼性质与瑞典等北欧国家一样，其领导人意在公平分配经济增长的收益
