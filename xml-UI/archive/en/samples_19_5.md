the company has been going to `great lengths to` present itself as open, transparent and trustworthy.
该公司一直在`不遗余力地`展现自己公开、透明、值得信赖的形象。

Mr. Jiang’s explanation `boiled down to` this: `On paper`, he said, Huawei is owned by a labor union that `solicits donations` from employees when their colleagues have health problems `and the like`. 
江西生的解释`可归结为：理论上`，他说，华为是由工会所有，当员工遭遇健康`或类似`问题之时，工会`号召`同事之间予以捐助。

`Naturally`, it is `a little more complicated than that`. This, too, is `not as simple as it seems`.
实际情况`自然要比这个复杂一点`。同样，这也`没看上去那么简单`。

Huawei’s ownership is a `murky` matter because the company has never, in `more than three decades of existence`, sold shares to the public
华为的所有权是个`含糊不清的`问题，因为`成立30多年来`，这家公司从未向公众出售过股份

But these assurances have never quite `dispelled officials’ suspicions` that Beijing are somehow `pulling the strings`. 
但这些保证并没有`打消`美国官员的疑虑，他们怀疑北京当局`某种程度上是幕后的操纵者`。

Over the past year, Washington’s `long-simmering distrust` toward Huawei, the world’s leading maker of the equipment that powers cellphone networks, has `morphed into an all-out assault` on the company.
过去一年里，经过`长期酝酿`，华盛顿对世界领先的手机网络设备制造商华为的不信任，`演变成了对该公司的全面攻击`。

But the prosecutors leading `the largest-ever` college `admissions` prosecution have also `alluded to` other families, not named and not charged, who paid far more. 
但是，负责这场`有史以来规模最大的`大学`入学诉讼`的检察官还`提到`其他家庭，他们支付的费用要高得多，这些家庭的姓名没有被透露，也没有受到指控。

Mr. Singer had `paid Mr. Meredith a bribe` to `designate the young woman as a recruit` for the team. Mr. Singer has `pleaded guilty to racketeering` and other charges, and Mr. Meredith has pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges.
辛格曾向梅雷迪思`行贿`，`指定`这位年轻女子`成为球队的征募运动员`。辛格对`诈骗和其他指控认罪`，梅雷迪思对造假和共谋指控认罪。

she said, “I cannot comment `other than to say` it is an ongoing investigation.”
她说，“我只能说，调查正在进行中。”

while Ms. Guo herself was `na?ve about` how the college admissions process worked in the United States. (Mr. Spertus `would not identify` Ms. Guo’s parents.)
而雪莉・郭本人对美国的大学招生过程也`毫无了解`。（斯珀图斯`不愿透露`雪莉・郭父母的身份。）

Mr. Spertus said the `large size of the payment` suggested that Mr. Singer was `exploiting` Ms. Guo’s family and their lack of knowledge about the college process.
斯珀特斯说，这笔款项`数额之巨`，`表明`辛格在`利用`郭的家人对大学录取过程的无知漫天要价。

“The `amount alone` shows that he was `preying on` the Chinese community,” he said. “The donation was made to help `underprivileged youth`. They were not aware that the money went to Meredith. They did not know that he was going to use that money for a bribe. `There is no evidence of that whatsoever`.”
“`单从这个金额`就可以看出，他是在`掠夺`华人社区，”他说。“这笔捐款本意是为了帮助`贫困青年`。他们不知道钱被梅雷迪思拿走了。他们不知道他要用这笔钱行贿。`总之一切都是没有证据的`。”

The two families, the Povlsens and the Ibrahims, `were about to intersect`. They both were `well-known and admired`, part of wildly successful, `close-knit `business families from `opposite ends of the world` and perhaps opposite ends of the `ideological spectrum`.
波尔森与易卜拉欣，这两个家庭的命运`即将交汇`。两家都是`知名人士，也都广受尊敬`。他们来自两个极其成功、`关系密切的`商业家族，它们分属`世界两端`，或许还处于`意识形态谱系`的两端。

Sri Lanka’s Muslims have been `painfully perplexed` by the question of why two of their `most privileged` sons would do this.
斯里兰卡的穆斯林一直在`苦苦思索`这样一个问题：为什么`出身最优越的`两个孩子会这样做?

In the `bowels of` Colombo’s Muslim quarter, he `slaved away` as a cook, then as a vendor of onions. Then he got into sesame and pepper. `Sack by sack, he inched up` the spice trade.
在科伦坡穆斯林聚居区的`中心地带`，他`拼命苦干`，先是做厨师，然后是卖洋葱。后来开始经营`芝麻和胡椒`。他`一袋一袋地发展起`自己的香料生意。

Sri Lanka’s `tropical climate` and rich soil produce some of the world’s `most desired spices`.
斯里兰卡的`热带气候`和`肥沃的土壤`造就了一些世界上`最受欢迎的`香料。

He bought and sold so much, merchants said, that he could `set the price`. 
商人们说，他的买卖量大到可以`左右定价`。

His eldest son, Inshaf, around 35, was `flashier`. He drove a new white Toyota Landcruiser and `stood taller than` most Sri Lankan men, about 5 feet 11 inches, with a `muscular build`. Friends said he walked fast, no matter where he was going.
他的大儿子因沙夫`更张扬`一些，他35岁左右，开着一辆崭新的白色丰田陆地巡洋舰，`个头比`大多数斯里兰卡男人要高，大约5英尺11英寸（合1.8米），`肌肉发达`。朋友们说，不管要去哪儿，他总是走得很快。

He was a handsome man, `healthy looking`, and `sported a snug-fitting gray suit` and a long `wispy beard`.
他是一个英俊的男人，`看上去很健康`，`穿着一套合身的灰色西装`，留着长长的`一绺绺的`胡须。

the second son, around 31, was `more withdrawn`. Merchants on Old Moor Street `barely saw` him. It seems his job was to `oversee` a family pepper farm near Matale, a city a few hours away.
二儿子31岁上下，性格`比较内向`。老摩尔街上的商人们`几乎从没见过`他。他的工作似乎是`管理`距科伦坡几小时车程的马克莱市郊外一个家族胡椒农场。

“He was `clearly reluctant`,” the family member said. “He was always `more connected to people` than Ilham.”
“他`显然很犹豫`，”这位家庭成员说。“他总是比伊尔沙姆`更喜欢和人打交道`。”

to try to protect his `aura of indomitability` or retreat after President Trump accused China of `reneging on the terms` of a draft agreement and threatened to raise tariffs.
是坚守`不屈不挠的光环`，还是在特朗普总统指责中国在协议草案的条款上`出尔反尔`并威胁增加关税后退缩。

The `stakes rose sharply` for the Chinese leader this week, The `sticking point` appeared to be a late decision
这位中国领导人所面临的`风险急剧上升`。`症结`似乎是最后关头作出决定

He is `walking a tightrope`, He is going to be the one that has to `make the most concessions`, and that `makes all this more difficult for him`.”
他在走钢丝，他将会是那个必须作出最大让步的一方，那将使得所有这些对他而言难上加难。

Even if the timing of the launches is a `coincidence`, they could `serve to remind` the United States that it needs China’s help to maintain pressure on the North and keep its nuclear program in check.
即便发射的时机`纯属巧合`，它也`有助于提醒`美国，在持续给朝鲜施压、控制它的核项目方面，美国需要中国的帮助。

I come `bearing sincerity`, and hope in the current special circumstances to `hold a reasoned, frank exchange of views with` the U.S. side. China believes that `increasing tariffs` won’t solve problems, won’t benefit China or the United States, and nor will it benefit the global economy.
我是`带着诚意`而来，希望在当前特殊形势下，`理性、坦诚地`与美方交换意见，中方认为，`加征关税`不是解决问题的办法，对中美双方不利，对世界也不利。

any legislative change or `policy reversal` could be a very public ― and `potentially humbling` ― reminder that it `gave ground under pressure`.
任何立法上的变更或`政策逆转`都可能无异于非常公开地――并且`可能是令人羞辱地`――表明它`在压力之下做出了让步`。

The `blaring nature` of the Trump administration’s `broadsides` has `sharpened the dilemma`
特朗普政府发出刺耳的`猛烈抨击`，`加剧了在谈判中所面临的困境`。

We organize the money in our wallets in `units of currency, dollars and cents, bills and coins`.
钱夹里的钱，我们会`按货币单位、美元和美分、纸币和硬币分类整理`。

I got the usual looks from people `fresh out of bars` or parties, either because of the stench of a hard night’s work on my clothes or because I was `muttering to myself` while `feverishly flipping flashcards`.
`刚出酒吧`或参加完派对的人朝我递来惯常的目光，要么是因为辛苦工作一整晚后，我的衣服上发着恶臭，要么是我`一边疯狂翻动学习卡片，一边低声自言自语`。

China `moved to retaliate against` the United States, announcing plans on Monday to raise tariffs on American goods `ranging from` beer and wine to swimsuits, shirts and `liquefied natural gas`.
中国`采取行动报复`美国，宣布计划提高从啤酒、葡萄酒到泳衣、衬衫和`液化天然气`等美国商品的关税。

The last of these threats once `unnerved markets` but has since `lost some of its edge`. China has been `diversifying` for the past decade where it parks its money, and had to spend a quarter of its huge hoard of `foreign currency reserves` three years ago to `stem a decline` in its currency.
最后一项威胁曾令市场`感到不安`，但现在已经`失去了一些威力`。过去10年，中国一直在实现外汇储备`多元化`，三年前不得不动用其巨额`外汇储备`的四分之一来`阻止人民币贬值`。

it won’t take effect for a few weeks, `giving both sides a bit more room to` reach a deal.
其在几周内不会生效，给了双方`更多达成协议的空间`

Not many 17-year-old girls know how to `solder two copper pipes together` or light the `pilot light` on a `water heater`. I venture that most people would `struggle to tell the difference` between a regular 90-degree PVC elbow and a street 90.
没有几个17岁的女孩知道怎么把两根铜管焊在一起，或者点燃热水器的长明火。我敢说，大多数人分不清90度普通PVC弯头和90度公母弯头。

Each `humid` morning, I `wrestle myself into` a pair of used men’s jeans from Goodwill that most of my peers would refuse to be seen wearing in public. I slip my `tape measure` onto my belt, tie my hair back as I run out the door, and climb into the passenger seat of the `plumber truck`, which is really an aged white minivan with two kinds of pipes `strapped to the top`.
每个`潮湿的`早晨，我都要勉强穿上一条Goodwill慈善二手店里买来的男式牛仔裤，大多数同龄人都不愿意在公共场合穿成这样。我把卷尺挂在腰带上，跑出家门时匆匆把头发束成辫子，爬上`管道工施工车`的副驾驶座。这是一辆有年头的白色小面包车，`车顶绑着`两种管子。

As my peers begin their `shifts nannying`, lifeguarding or `checking out groceries`, my dad and I `haul` unwieldy toolboxes and heavy-duty saws into the depths of people’s houses. Although at times we work in the `gold-plated` master bathrooms of mansions with lake views, we usually end up in `dank`, mildewed basements where I get lost in `mazes of` storage boxes looking for the `water meter`.
我的同龄人当兼职保姆、救生员或者清点杂货的时候，我帮着爸爸把笨重的工具箱和重型锯子拖到人们房子的深处。虽然有时也在湖景豪宅的镀金主浴室里干活，但我们往往还是在潮湿发霉的地下室里，我得在迷宫般的储物箱之间找水表。

I `constantly` leap over tangled piles of wrenches and `extension cords`. My mouth and nose are covered by a dust mask; my jeans are `smudged` with pipe `dope`, and my hands are `blackened` with the `grime` of a hard day’s work.
我一次又一次地跳过一堆堆杂乱的扳手和延长线；鼻子和嘴上蒙着厚厚的灰尘；牛仔裤上沾满管道涂料，双手也因为一整天的辛苦工作而变得黑乎乎的。

And when I think about it, I `cope with` messes all the time. The `uncertainties and contradictions` of my teenage brain are far more tangled than any extension cord, but I keep trying to `sort them out`. Life is a process of accepting the messes and learning to clean them up, and plumbing work `is no different`.
当我思考这个问题的时候，我也一直都在处理混乱。作为青少年，我头脑里的不确定性和矛盾比任何延长线都要复杂得多，但我一直在试图理清它们。生活是一个接受混乱并且学会清理的过程，管道工作也不例外。
