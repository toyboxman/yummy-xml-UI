President Trump was right to engage in some trade `shock therapy` with Beijing. China no longer just wants to sell the U.S. toys and tennis shoes. It now wants to sell the same high-tech products, like 5G telecom, robotics, electric cars and A.I. systems, that America `specializes in`. So China `had to be made to bluntly understand` that the U.S. would not look the other way anymore from China’s `longstanding abusive` trade practices, nor would it be `bought off`, either.
特朗普总统对北京采取某种贸易休克疗法是对的。中国不再只想把玩具和网球鞋卖给美国。它现在想出售跟美国所擅长的同样的高科技产品，比如5G电信、机器人、电动汽车和人工智能系统。因此，必须单刀直入地让中国认识到，美国不会再对中国长期的贸易滥用行为视而不见，也不会被买通。

a high-profile three-day state visit that will include some `panda diplomacy` and underscore the `strengthening Beijing-Moscow axis` at a time when relations for both with Washington `continue to fray`.
高调的国事访问，访问将包括熊猫外交，并在与华盛顿的关系持续紧张之际，强调北京莫斯科轴心的加强。

We see `record-high` volumes of trade with China, we see `positive dynamics`, joint projects and `so on and so forth`

President Vladimir V. Putin declared that Russia would `pivot toward` Asia `in the wake of` Western economic sanctions and other efforts to isolate Russia `prompted by` its `annexation` of Crimea and `destabilization` of Ukraine.
普京宣称，鉴于西方的经济制裁，及俄罗斯吞并克里米亚、破坏乌克兰稳定引发的孤立俄罗斯的其他举动，俄罗斯将把重心转向亚洲。

The Kremlin has `conceded` that China’s Belt and Road initiative will `overshadow` its historic control over Central Asia, since Moscow cannot `compete economically`.
克里姆林宫承认，中国的“一带一路”倡议将会影响到它对中亚地区多年来的控制，因为莫斯科在经济上无法与其展开竞争

If relations have `come a long way` since 1969, Russian `public sentiment` has not `quite matched the warmth` expressed by the Kremlin. While around 1.7 million Chinese tourists visited Russia last year, more than a million Russians `signed a petition` against a Chinese-backed `water bottling plant` on the shores of Lake Baikal, one of Russia’s most spectacular natural sights. Around 10 Chinese-financed hotels on the lake are scheduled for `demolition`.
如果说两国关系自1969年以来取得了很大进展，俄罗斯民众的情绪与克里姆林宫表现出的热情并不完全一致。去年到访俄罗斯的中国游客大约有170万人，有超过100万的俄罗斯人签署了一份请愿书，反对在俄罗斯最壮观的自然景观之一贝加尔湖岸边建一家中国出资的瓶装水工厂。湖畔约10家中资酒店也计划拆除

Russia is the `needier partner` ― it needs new markets, sources of finance and sources of technology that it cannot get because of sanctions,” he said. “`Over the long run`, Russia is locking itself into a partnership where China `has a better hand`.
俄罗斯是更需要支持的合作伙伴，它需要新的市场、资金和技术来源，这些都是因为制裁而无法得到的东西，”他说。“从长远来看，俄罗斯将自己锁定在了一种中方拥有更大优势的伙伴关系中。

Mainly, though, Russia is `thrilled` that Mr. Xi is showing up at the St. Petersburg investment forum with a large delegation when it is being `shunned` by the West. “It allows them to `present a middle finger` to the U.S.: ‘We have China,’” Mr. Gabuev said.
不过，最主要的是，在西方国家纷纷回避的情况下，习近平带着一个庞大的代表团出现在圣彼得堡的投资论坛上，这令俄罗斯非常激动。“这使得他们可以向美国比中指：‘我们有中国’，”加布耶夫说。

A `cacophonous sea of tens of thousands of people`, dressed in red and waving flags, `chanted and blasted air horns` here in Taiwan’s capital.
数万名民众嘈杂地聚集在这个位于台湾首都的地方，身穿红色服装，挥舞着旗帜，高呼着口号，吹着汽笛

After waiting for hours through rain and `seemingly endless speeches`, the crowd began cheering `ecstatically` when Han Kuo-yu, the new star of the opposition Kuomintang, finally arrived. It took him 10 minutes to reach the stage, `shaking his clasped hands` in appreciation as his admirers crowded him, hoping to get photos.
他们在雨中等待了几个小时，听了似乎没完没了的演讲之后，反对党国民党的新星韩国瑜终于到了，人群立刻开始欣喜若狂地欢呼起来。韩国瑜向人群抱拳致谢，崇拜者蜂拥而上，希望给他拍照，他花了10分钟才走上了舞台。

To his supporters, Mr. Han, who was elected mayor of the city of Kaohsiung just last year, is a straight-shooting maverick unafraid to challenge Taiwan’s political elites
在支持者眼里，去年才当选高雄市市长的韩国瑜是一个坦诚直言的特立独行者，敢于挑战台湾的政治精英

“The people in charge today all have `vested interests`; we don’t want them,” she said. “Han Kuo-yu represents `the common people`.”
“今天的掌权者都有既得利益；我们不需要他们，”她说。“韩国瑜代表老百姓。”

He also `met behind closed doors` with the top Communist officials in Hong Kong and Macau, which are administered by China under “one country, two systems” `arrangements` that, `at least in theory`, give the territories `a high degree of autonomy`
韩国瑜还与香港和澳门的共产党高层官员举行了闭门会晤。香港和澳门由中国按照“一国两制”的框架管理，该框架至少在理论上给予这些地区某种高度自治

“Whoever eats apples these days must be `loaded`,” said Li Tao, who has been selling apples for more than 20 years.
“现在只要吃苹果的都是土豪，”卖了20多年苹果的李涛说。

“People and economists `talk like ships in the night`,” said George Magnus, an associate at the China Center at Oxford University
“老百姓和经济学家通常是各说各的，”牛津大学中国中心研究员乔治・马格努斯说

Chinese officials are still trying to `contain the outbreak` of swine fever, which doesn’t make people sick but can be fatal in pigs. More than a million pigs have been `culled` to stop the spread of the disease, though it appears to be continuing. 
国官员仍在努力控制猪瘟疫情的爆发，这种病虽不会使人患病，但对猪却是致命的。为防止疫情扩散，100多万头猪已被扑杀，但疫情似乎仍在继续

President Xi Jinping has `signaled tough times` ahead as `tensions rise` with the United States. Data released on Friday suggest that a `nascent economic uptick` is beginning to `wane` and that China could slip back into a slowdown
主席已暗示将迎来一段艰难时期。周五公布的数据显示，新出现的经济上扬将开始消退，中国可能会重新陷入经济放缓

For now, the price increases `appear limited to` food, `thanks in part to` China’s uncertain economic situation
目前，物价上涨似乎仅限于食品，部分原因在于中国经济形势的不确定性

officials would “effectively guarantee the market supply of `daily necessities` such as fruits and vegetables, meat and eggs products.”
官方将“切实保障水果蔬菜肉蛋产品等生活必需品的市场供应。”

“These four options are just `trying to smooth things over`,” one person wrote. “It’s obviously inflation.” “I can’t `afford eating` now,” said one commenter. “Fruit is `as expensive as gold`.”
“四个选项就是和稀泥，”一个人写道。“明明是通货膨胀。”  “吃不起啊！”一位评论者说。“水果贵如黄金。”

Details about the meetings, the latest move in two weeks of `high-stakes economic brinkmanship` between the United States and China, were shared by two people familiar with them, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to discuss them and could `face retribution`.
过去两周以来，美国和中国互相采取了一些高风险的经济边缘政策，而此番约谈是其中的最新发展。因未被授权讨论此事且可能遭惩罚，透露会议细节的两名知情人士要求不具名

This is now `extremely delicate` because the Trump administration, through its `brinkmanship tactics`, has destabilized the entire relationship, commercial and `otherwise`
这个问题如今极其敏感，因为特朗普政府已通过它的边缘政策，破坏了商业及其他方面的整个关系的稳定

There is `a strong perception` in Beijing that the U.S. government `is intent on blunting` China’s technology rise, and that if this process is not slowed or stopped, the future of China’s entire digital economy is at risk
北京方面`强烈感觉`到，美国政府`有意阻止`中国在技术上的崛起，且如不使这一过程放缓或止步，则中国整个数字经济的未来将面临风险

American companies aren’t going to violate American laws, especially in such a `high-profile context` where their actions are `scrutinized`,” he said. “The companies are `between a rock and a hard place`, but that hard place will win out
美国公司不会违反美国法律，尤其是在现在这个备受瞩目的语境下，它们的一举一动都有人在看着，”他说。“这些公司处于进退两难的境地，但是他们会选择其中一方。

“The China deal’s going to `work out`,” Mr. Trump said in an interview on CNBC. “You know why? Because of tariffs. Because right now China is `getting absolutely decimated` by companies that are leaving China, going to other countries, including our own, because they don’t want to pay the tariffs.”
“对中国的政策会见效的，”特朗普在接受CNBC采访时说。“你知道为什么嘛？因为有关税。因为现在那些离开中国的公司正在彻底重挫中国，它们去了其他国家，包括我们国家，因为它们不想支付关税。”

The president has `long favored tariffs` as an immediate and `unilateral` policy tool. But his increasing confidence that the `levies` have helped `accomplish his goals` without harming the United States sets up an even more tumultuous period ahead for businesses, consumers and foreign countries.
总统长期以来一直偏爱将关税作为直接的、单方面的政策工具。但他越来越相信，征税已在不伤害美国的情况下帮助实现其目标，这种自信，将给企业、消费者和各国带来一个更加动荡的时期。

Markets are already `counting on` the Federal Reserve to come to the rescue by `cutting interest rates`. Fed officials `have begun signaling` they are prepared to help `prop up` the economy to `counter any slowdown` from Mr. Trump’s trade war, a development that could give the president even more `leeway` to carry out an aggressive trade policy.
市场已经指望美联储通过降息来施以救助。美联储官员已开始暗示，他们做好了帮助支撑经济，以应对特朗普贸易战导致的任何放缓的准备，此举可能会给总统更多的空间去实施积极强硬的贸易政策。

“They `devalue their currency`. They have for years,” he said. “It’s put them at a `tremendous competitive advantage`, and we don’t have that advantage because we have a Fed that doesn’t `lower interest rates`.”
“他们贬值货币。他们已经这么做很多年了，“他说。“这使他们拥有巨大的竞争优势，我们没有这种优势，因为我们有一个不愿降息的美联储。”

The president insisted his tariffs were having their `intended effect` ― pressuring other countries to make deals, `prompting companies` to move factories back to the United States and generating an enormous amount of money, all without costing American consumers.
总统坚称，他的关税起到了应有的作用――迫使其他国家签订协议，促使企业把工厂迁回美国，并收获了一大批钱，且全都不会给美国消费者造成损失。

Mr. Trump said on Monday that he `saw no downside` to taxing nearly everything China sends into the United States, saying it would continue to boost the American economy.
特朗普周一表示，他看不出给中国出口到美国的几乎每样商品征税有什么不妥，称这将继续推动美国经济。

与此同时，美国继续在为下一轮中国关税做准备。这一轮关税将打击多个门类的消费品，包括运动鞋、电视和婴儿床。

Two weeks before talks between the United States and China broke down, Beijing quietly called one of its most `formidable` trade negotiators out of a `pre-retirement posting`.
就在中美谈判破裂两周前，北京悄悄地将一位最令人生畏的贸易谈判代表从他退休前的职务调离

“He is one of `the most savvy` Chinese trade officials that the U.S. has dealt with,” “`Recalling him` from Geneva after only a year shows the lack of senior trade people in Beijing with whom the leadership feels comfortable.”
“他是美国打过交道的最精明的中国贸易官员之一，”“仅仅一年后就将他从日内瓦召回，表明北京缺乏让领导层放心的资深贸易人士。”

On Tuesday, President Trump said that China “wants to make a deal `very badly`” but that he would accept a deal only if China agreed to the previous trade terms.“It’s me right now that’s `holding up` the deal,” he said `in remarks` at the White House. “We had a deal with China, and unless they go back to that deal, `I have no interest`.”
周二，特朗普总统表示，中国“非常想达成协议”，但只有在中国同意之前的贸易条款的情况下，他才会接受协议。“现在是我在拖延这笔交易，”他在白宫发表讲话时说。“我们和中国有过一项协议，除非他们回到那个协议，否则我没有任何兴趣。”

Prime Minister Scott Morrison `played it down` as a “reciprocal visit” and a sign of “the relationship 
that we have.” National security experts, however, called it a show of force by China and a `double-edged` reminder of Australia’s longstanding relationship with China and its growing military ambitions.
澳大利亚总理斯科特・莫里森轻描淡写地称之为“回访”，显示了“我们之间的关系”。而国家安全专家却称它是中国在展示武力，并且是一石二鸟，同时提示了澳中关系的由来已久以及中国日益壮大的军事野心。

“No Australian government is willing to risk relations with China by `siding too overtly` with Washington,” 
said Hugh White, emeritus professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University. 
“This has become more and more clear as U.S. rivalry with China has become more `overt`.”

without America as our `major ally`,” he said. “But `the unthinkable` is now being thought about much more 
seriously than at any time since at least the end of the Vietnam War.”
“这对澳大利亚人来说是一个困难的问题，因为我们很难想象没有美国作为我们的主要盟友会是什么样子，”他说。
“但至少自越南战争结束以来，人们现在比以往任何时候都更认真地考虑这个难以想象的问题。”

China, however, has tried to `play down` role as international `spoiler`.

“Having an exclusion process `in place` that is usable for these manufacturers who are being harmed, and

“要设定一个排除程序，供这些正遭受损失的制造商使用，他们有的遭受了极大损失，需要解决这个问题，”
“我认为当前实施的部分贸易政策产生了太多像这样意想不到的后果。”

Almost all of the company officials `testifying` said they supported the administration’s attempts to 
reach a `more level playing field` with China on trade, and a few argued for more protection for their industry.
几乎所有参与作证的公司高管都表示，他们支持本届政府为实现更公平的对华贸易竞争环境所作的努力，少数要求对他们的行业给予更多保护。
