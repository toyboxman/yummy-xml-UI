President Trump was right to engage in some trade `shock therapy` with Beijing. China no longer just wants to sell the U.S. toys and tennis shoes. It now wants to sell the same high-tech products, like 5G telecom, robotics, electric cars and A.I. systems, that America `specializes in`. So China `had to be made to bluntly understand` that the U.S. would not look the other way anymore from China’s `longstanding abusive` trade practices, nor would it be `bought off`, either.
特朗普总统对北京采取某种贸易休克疗法是对的。中国不再只想把玩具和网球鞋卖给美国。它现在想出售跟美国所擅长的同样的高科技产品，比如5G电信、机器人、电动汽车和人工智能系统。因此，必须单刀直入地让中国认识到，美国不会再对中国长期的贸易滥用行为视而不见，也不会被买通。

If relations have `come a long way` since 1969, Russian `public sentiment` has not `quite matched the warmth` expressed by the Kremlin. While around 1.7 million Chinese tourists visited Russia last year, more than a million Russians `signed a petition` against a Chinese-backed `water bottling plant` on the shores of Lake Baikal, one of Russia’s most spectacular natural sights. Around 10 Chinese-financed hotels on the lake are scheduled for `demolition`.
如果说两国关系自1969年以来取得了很大进展，俄罗斯民众的情绪与克里姆林宫表现出的热情并不完全一致。去年到访俄罗斯的中国游客大约有170万人，有超过100万的俄罗斯人签署了一份请愿书，反对在俄罗斯最壮观的自然景观之一贝加尔湖岸边建一家中国出资的瓶装水工厂。湖畔约10家中资酒店也计划拆除

Russia is the `needier partner` ― it needs new markets, sources of finance and sources of technology that it cannot get because of sanctions,” he said. “`Over the long run`, Russia is locking itself into a partnership where China `has a better hand`.

Mainly, though, Russia is `thrilled` that Mr. Xi is showing up at the St. Petersburg investment forum with a large delegation when it is being `shunned` by the West. “It allows them to `present a middle finger` to the U.S.: ‘We have China,’” Mr. Gabuev said.
不过，最主要的是，在西方国家纷纷回避的情况下，习近平带着一个庞大的代表团出现在圣彼得堡的投资论坛上，这令俄罗斯非常激动。“这使得他们可以向美国比中指：‘我们有中国’，”加布耶夫说。

After waiting for hours through rain and `seemingly endless speeches`, the crowd began cheering `ecstatically` when Han Kuo-yu, the new star of the opposition Kuomintang, finally arrived.

韩国瑜还与香港和澳门的共产党高层官员举行了闭门会晤。香港和澳门由中国按照“一国两制”的框架管理，该框架至少在理论上给予这些地区某种高度自治

“老百姓和经济学家通常是各说各的，”牛津大学中国中心研究员乔治・马格努斯说
