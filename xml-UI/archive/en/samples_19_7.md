Hong Kong’s people don’t `look as rich as they once did`. Mainlanders now see that the majority of Hong Kong 
residents don’t live in `sea view villas`, drive luxury cars or `dine in fine restaurants` as they saw in `soap operas`.
They live in `cramped apartments`, often much smaller than theirs in Beijing and Shanghai, and work long hours to 
make a living in one of the most expensive cities in the world.
香港人看起来不像以前那么富有了。内地人现在看到，大多数香港人并不像他们在肥皂剧中看到的那样，住海景别墅、开豪车，
或在高档餐厅用餐。大多数香港人住在狭小的公寓里，通常比他们在北京和上海的公寓小得多，为了在世界上生活成本最高的
城市之一谋生，香港人要工作很长的时间。

`Not only did` the book get published and top best-seller lists, but the `ensuing` film has `stormed to No. 1` at 
the box office, `buoyed by warm reviews` and aggressive `theater-renting campaigns`.
这本书不仅得到出版，登上畅销书排行榜第一位，而且，受益于热烈的影评和积极的包场活动，根据它改编的电影还成了票房冠军

Yet the outlines of the `tentative peace` accord President Trump reached on Saturday with his Chinese counterpart,
Xi Jinping, could further `cement a broad reshuffling of` the global economic order that `undermines` China’s 
decades-long role as the world’s factory floor.
然而，特朗普总统周六与中国国家主席习近平达成的初步和平协议的梗概，可能会进一步巩固全球经济秩序的广泛重组，削弱中国数十年来作为世界工厂的地位。

Even a `fragile` truce could have `lingering implications`
即使这次不牢固的休战也会有迟迟不去的影响

As long as the threat `is out there`, there are risks in depending on these long supply chains, Businesses don’t 
like uncertainty, and this `prolongs the uncertainty`.
只要威胁存在，就有依赖这些长供应链的风险，企业不喜欢不确定性，目前的做法延长了不确定性。

China will not `concede its sovereignty` and show weakness
中国不会放弃主权，也不会示弱

What this has shown is there is `massive uncertainty`, and we’re not going to `go back to the way things were`
这已经表明存在着巨大的不确定性，我们不会回到以前做事的方式了

`Uprooting` an entire supply chain is a nightmare task, It takes years, if not decades.
将整条供应链连根拔起是项噩梦般的任务。即使不需要几十年，也要花上好几年时间

President Trump warned this past week that he was concerned about the `influx` of goods from Vietnam. 
The surge could `invite scrutiny` from the Trump administration
特朗普总统曾在过去的一周警告，他对大量商品从越南涌入感到担忧, 这种激增可能会招致特朗普政府的审查。

Still, China has `few options to stop` those shifts. Trade between the two countries is so `lopsided` that China has many fewer American imports to tax
不过，中国几乎没有办法阻止这些转移。中美两国之间的贸易如此不平衡，以至于中国能加征关税的美国进口商品要少得多

Even then, leaders from both major American parties have indicated that the United States could continue to 
`take a tough line` on China `no matter who` is in the White House. The attitudes toward Huawei, in particular, 
`show an appetite` on both sides of the `aisle` for taking a tough line
尽管如此，美国两大政党的领导人都表示，无论谁入主白宫，美国都可能继续对中国采取强硬立场。尤其是对华为的态度显示出两党都有采取强硬立场的意愿

called Huawei “one of few `potent levers` we have to make China `play fair` on trade.“If President Trump 
backs off, as it appears he is doing, it will `dramatically undercut` our ability to change China’s unfair trade practices”
把华为称作是“我们拥有的让中国在贸易上采用公平做法的少数有力杠杆之一”。 如果特朗普总统退却，就像他现在正在做的，那将大大削弱我们改变中国不公平贸易做法的能力

Even if they try to `thread the needle` here on how they implement whatever Trump has decided, his message 
alone seriously undercuts the efforts put in to try and persuade our allies to join us
即使他们试图在如何执行特朗普已经决定的事情上尽力而为，单是他释放的这个信息本身就严重削弱了为说服盟友加入到我们的行列所做的努力
