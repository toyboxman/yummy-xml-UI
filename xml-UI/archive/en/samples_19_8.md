in the face of what he sees as a `quixotic, emotion-driven` President Trump, He needs to `appear strong`, to preserve his `firm grip on the political apparatus and public propaganda machine`. He must also deal with `the weight of history` that contends the Communist Party must not `bend to` foreign nations.
面对在他看来不切实际、感情用事的特朗普总统，这位中国领导人别无选择。他需要表现出强势，以保持对政治机器和公共宣传机器的牢牢控制。他还必须顾及到共产党不能向外国势力低头的历史压力。 

The People’s Daily `berated` Washington ― though `stopped short of naming` Mr. Trump ― for “its `obsession with` American privileges.” “The U.S. is extremely `irresponsible`,” the paper said
人民日报指责华盛顿“毫不掩饰对美式特权的迷恋”，不过没有点出特朗普的名字。“（美国）极度不负责任，”该报称

If China’s `economy sours`, it could `erode his authority` and `empower` his political rivals.
如果中国经济恶化，他的权威可能会被削弱，从而壮大政治对手的力量。

Should China fully `weaponize its currency`, its economy could `take a hit`. But he has hinted that the country could `ride that out`
倘若中国将货币完全武器化，其经济会遭受损失。但他曾暗示，国家能度过这一关

Beijing has `opened up the money spigots` to allow for big infrastructure projects that have temporarily created economic growth and employment. But to make this happen, China’s debt has `ballooned`
北京拧开了资金阀门，以便大型基础设施项目得以运行，这样暂时创造了经济增长和就业机会, 但为实现这一点，中国的债务也随之激增

Big tax cuts that were meant to `spur economic growth` have `left the central government short of the revenue` it needs to `help paper over the shortages` at the local level.
意在刺激经济增长的大幅减税措施，又导致中央政府缺乏帮助地方补缺口所需的收入

Consumers, while `patriotic`, are also beginning to `feel the hardship`. For months ordinary shoppers have faced `big price hikes` for `basic food staples` like fruit and pork.
消费者虽然爱国，但也开始感到处境艰难。数月以来，普通购物者一直面临水果和猪肉这类主要食物价格大幅上涨的情况

China’s `currency devaluation` will temporarily help it to `offset the impact of tariffs` on the economy by making Chinese goods competitive
中国货币贬值可使中国商品更具竞争力，暂时可帮助抵消关税对经济的影响

And unlike dumb toys, they are all `dual` use. That is, they can potentially be used by China to `tap into` our society for `intelligence or malicious purposes`. And once they are `embedded`, they are hard to remove. We should not `exaggerate this threat`
和那些非智能玩具不一样，它们都有双重用途。也就是说，它们有可能被中国利用，带着情报目的或其他恶意目的进入我们的社会。而且一旦被植入就很难移除, 我们不应该夸大这一威胁

Another reason we’re having this trade war is that both Xi and Trump have `overreached`.
我们发生贸易战的另一个原因是都做过头了

No, don’t `rock the boat`. We’re still making money here
不，别捣乱。我们还在这儿赚钱呢

the government would provide `enormous subsidies, loans and investment funds` so that Chinese companies could `overtake their foreign rivals`
政府将提供巨大的补贴、贷款和投资基金，中国企业可能会超过他们的外国竞争对手

So now we have less leverage and are involved in a `tit-for-tat tariff war` ― with no allies ― and we have made it a `nationalist-pride` question of who will `lose face` first
于是我们的影响力变小，又在没有盟友的情况下，卷入了针锋相对的关税战，并且我们还把它变成了一个民族自豪感的问题――谁会先丢面子

For much of the past century, the Forbidden City has been an `imposing void` in the `otherwise bustling heart of Beijing`
在过去一个世纪的大部分时间里，紫禁城一直是在除它以外熙熙攘攘的北京市中心一个壮观的空空之处

The 180-acre compound, where emperors and their advisers `plotted China’s course` for centuries, was `stripped of its purpose` when the last emperor `abdicated` in 1912
好几个世纪里，历代皇帝及其辅佐曾在这片占地72万平方米的建筑群中共商国是。末代皇帝于1912年退位后，这片建筑群失去了原来的作用

As recently as 2012, only 30 percent of the `vast complex` was open to the public. Now, 80 percent is `accessible` ― quickly `filling with` exhibition spaces, `stylish` restaurants and cafes, bookstores, and `highly profitable gift stores`, as well as quiet walkways, `shady stands` of trees and `odd nooks` that invite contemplation of `bygone dynasties`
就在最近的2012年，这个庞大的建筑群中只有30%对公众开放。现在，游人可进入80%的地方，其中有些正快速成为陈列室、时尚餐厅和咖啡馆、书店，以及利润丰厚的礼品店，还有安静的步道、树影婆沙的树林，以及令人对逝去的朝代浮想联翩的一隅

The `revitalization` of the Forbidden City has `coincided with` a broader push in China to protect and project the country’s `cultural heritage`
紫禁城的重焕活力与中国保护本国文化遗产、投射国家文化实力的更广泛努力同步

We `never used to come here` because there wasn’t really too much to see, But now we can walk around and see new exhibitions. It makes it easier for younger people or children to `grasp the past`.”
我们以前从不到这里来，因为没有什么可看的，但现在我们能到处走，看新展览。这让年轻人或孩子更容易了解过去

`Successive emperors` had collected some of the best and most `iconic artifacts` of Chinese culture, especially the `monumental landscapes and calligraphy` that are among the most highly prized cultural products of `Chinese civilization`
历代皇帝收藏了中国文化中一些最优秀、最具标志性的文物，尤其是那些意义深远的山水画和书法作品，它们属于中国文明中最珍贵的文化产物

A few years after the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, the complex was in a sad state. Its mostly wooden buildings were `cracked, crumbling and peeling into an ugly grayness`.
1976年文化大革命结束后的几年里，故宫建筑群的状况十分糟糕。以木结构为主的建筑出现了裂缝，有的摇摇欲坠，建筑物的彩漆大多剥落，只剩下难看的灰色

Also surprising is that `government bodies` ― including the military ― have `vacated most of the halls` they once occupied
同样令人惊讶的是，政府部门，包括军方都已经搬出了大部分它们曾经占据的空间

But even all that new space is `not nearly enough` to showcase the treasures collected over the centuries by `the Sons of Heaven` during their `imperial reigns`
但是，即使所有这些新空间也不够展示数百年来的历代天子们在统治期间收集的宝物

They once `featured little more than` key chains and ugly dolls of eunuchs; now, they have `historically accurate reproductions` of `porcelain, textiles and even furniture`
这些礼品店以前卖的东西大都是钥匙链和难看的太监玩偶，现在它们有精确复制的瓷器、纺织品，甚至家具

they offered traditional porcelain or `cloisonné made by government-recognized masters` using traditional methods.
它们出售由政府认可的大师用传统方法制作的传统瓷器或景泰蓝等制品

It’s good that the Forbidden City is `taking a lead in keeping these traditional practices alive`, Their gift store has even become `fashionable in some circles`
故宫在保持这些传统制作方法上起了带头作用，这很好，故宫的礼品店甚至在一些圈子里变得很时尚起来

And some of the more `kitschy commercial activities` are being `curtailed`, including photo studios where people can `dress up like an emperor or empress`.
一些更庸俗的商业活动正在受到限制，包括让人装扮成皇帝或皇后拍照的照相馆

Most visitors are still part of `package tours` that quickly `funnel people through` the central part of the complex. But taking a slower, more `meandering path` through the Forbidden City is a better way to `soak up` the history and discover some of its secrets.
大多数游客仍随旅游团参观故宫，这种方式让游客从建筑群的中心区域迅速穿过。但更好的游览方式是在故宫里选择一条更慢、更绕来绕去的路，这能让人更好地了解历史、发现宫中一些普通游客看不到的秘密

But Chinese banks `are reluctant to lend` to private businesses because they consider big, state-owned enterprises more `reliable in paying off their debts`
但中国的银行不愿把钱借给私营企业，它们认为大型国有企业在偿还债务上更可靠

The fact that these things are `proliferating` again at a time of `entrenched economic downturn` should be `a signal of the degree of distress` that companies are finding themselves in
这些东西在经济顽固低迷的时候再次大量出现，应该是表明企业陷入了何种程度困境的一个信号

`Commercial acceptance bills are not legal tender`. Rather, they are pieces of paper promising payment in the future
商业承兑汇票不是法定货币，而是一种承诺未来支付的票据

More debt may be `floating around` China’s corporate world and `goes untracked` if the notes are being traded for less than their `face value`
如果这些欠条以低于面值的价格进行交易，那么中国企业界的流动债务可能更高，并且无法追踪

The global economy is `under increasing stress as growth cools` and trade tensions `take a mounting toll`. On Wednesday, the `tremors` were felt worldwide.
随着增长降温，贸易紧张关系导致全球经济受到的负面影响越来越大，全球经济受到的压力日益增加。周三，全世界各地都感受到了波动

The `global backdrop` has slowed more than anticipated, We’re not `immune` to the slowdown.
全球总体的放缓比人们预期要严重，我们也会受经济放缓的影响

Economic data have `softened and are increasingly sending recession signals`, particularly from the industrial side
经济数据疲软，并且在日益给出衰退信号，尤其是来自工业方面

The president’s decision Tuesday to delay some `duties` on Chinese imports `was meant to soften the blow` to U.S. consumers, easing the `economic headwinds`
总统周二推迟一些针对中国进口品加征关税的决定，意在减轻美国消费者受到的打击，缓和经济逆风

One major factor in the slide is the `barrage` of trade threats that have `unsettled` Chinese consumers, discouraging them from buying `big-ticket goods`
其中一个主要因素是接连不断的贸易威胁令中国消费者感到不安，不愿购买高价商品

That is `a humbling experience` for Germany, which has `lectured other countries` on how to manage their economies and `scolded them` for having too much debt
德国曾就如何管理本国经济教训其他国家，并指责这些国家背负了太多债务，这样的经济表现，对它来说显得非常丢脸

That industrial downturn `weighed on growth`, in the United States and around the world. But `a full-blown recession never materialized`
工业衰退给美国和世界各地的经济增长带来了压力。但一场全面的衰退并未成为现实

as they try to `fend off regulation` and `avoid being broken up`, some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley `are tripping over` their Allbirds in a race to `cozy up to` the United States government
硅谷一些最大的公司正试图避开监管，避免被拆分，它们脚蹬着Allbirds牌鞋子，在一场巴结美国政府的竞赛中纷纷绊倒

`Either way`, the game is the same: Salute the flag, `save our bacon`.
无论如何，玩都是同一套：向国旗敬礼，守卫我们的家园

Mr. Thiel, who did not respond to a request for comment, `is far from` the only `tech titan` trading in his hoodie for `a flag pin`.
蒂尔没有回应置评请求，但他绝不是唯一一个用连帽衫换国旗胸针的科技业巨子

If we `fail to act`, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are `dramatically different`
如果我们不采取行动，我们可能很快就会看到被其他价值观截然不同的人所控制的数字货币

He has spent much of the last decade `trying desperately to curry favor with` the Chinese government `in hopes of `getting Facebook’s apps ― which are banned there ― permission to operate in one of `the world’s most lucrative markets`
过去10年的大部分时间里，他都在拼命讨好中国政府，希望能让Facebook的应用获准在中国这个全球最赚钱的市场之一运营――它在那里遭到了禁止

Like Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Pichai was a China `booster` before he began `distancing himself from the country`
像扎克伯格一样，在与中国保持距离前，皮查伊也一直是这个国家的支持者

Amazon and Apple, two tech giants that love America so much that they have gone to `elaborate lengths to` avoid paying taxes to its Treasury, are also `promoting themselves as national champions`
亚马逊和苹果这两大巨头如此之热爱美国，以至于他们极尽能事，就为了避免向财政部交税。它们也将自己宣传成“国家骄傲”

`characterized` the tech industry’s scaremongering about China as a tactical move `meant to deflect criticism`.
科技业渲染的中国恐怖论是一种策略，意在转移批评

It’s a really `convenient narrative`, It `evokes nationalism` and `a red scare trope` that has worked in the past. And it implies that regulation, accountability and taking a pause to consider ethics would be `counter` to ‘winning.
这种叙事用起来顺手，能撩拨民族主义，还能激起过去曾经奏效过的红色恐惧比喻。它还暗示，监管、问责、伦理反思这些都将对‘获胜’不利”

There is `nothing inherently wrong with the belief` that America’s values are superior to those found in Shanghai and Shenzhen, or that American tech companies should `act in the country’s best interest`
相信美国价值观优于上海、深圳的价值观，本身并没有错，相信美国科技企业的行动应当考虑到国家利益也没错

Mr. Trump and his advisers are `staying on the sidelines`
特朗普及其顾问都在作壁上观

But as `violence escalates` and `old animosities are rekindled` across Asia, Washington has `chosen inaction`, and governments are ignoring the Trump administration’s `mild admonitions` and `calls for calm`
但随着亚洲各地暴力丛生、敌意重燃，华盛顿选择不作为，各国政府也在无视特朗普政府不痛不痒的警告和保持冷静的呼吁

Without `the steady centripetal force` of American diplomacy, disorder in Asia is `spinning` in all sorts of dangerous directions, `The net result` is not only increased risk of `regional turbulence`, but also long-term `corrosion of American influence`.
没有了稳定的美国外交向心力，亚洲的混乱开始向各种危险的方向跑，最终结果不仅是地区动荡风险加剧，还有美国影响力长期遭到弱化

South Korea and Japan have to sit down and `get along with each other`
韩国和日本必须坐下来，好好相处

But it was Mr. Trump who `escalated the Huawei affair`, turning `a discrete legal case` into `the showpiece` of his broader trade war
但正是特朗普让华为事件升级，把一个独立的法律案件变成他的广泛贸易战的一件代表作

Huawei did `commit intellectual property theft`, but it is also investing heavily in research and development
华为的确侵犯了知识产权，但它也在大力投资研发

Its supply contracts with American companies `amount to some $11 billion` a year. It `counts many foreign citizens on` its staff, including at senior levels
它每年与美国公司签订的供货合同总额约为110亿美元。它的工作人员中有许多外国公民，包括高层人员

it `stands for values` that should `resonate with` Americans, too: `a can-do attitude`, independent outlook and openness to the world
它所代表的价值观：积极进取的态度、独立的观点、向全世界开放――这些同样也应该能够引起美国人的共鸣

as the `trade war grinds on` ― how long that strength will `last` and whether it will be enough to `blunt other headwinds`
随着贸易战持续，这股力量能持续多久，是否足以减弱其他经济不利因素

The company received `an unwelcome bit of publicity` last week
上周，该公司收获了一些他们不太欢迎的曝光

but it took `some maneuvering` to find her books
但我花了些功夫才找到她的书

I liked the song, `sad and heavy`, a contrast to the `propaganda music` we grew up with
我喜欢这首歌，它悲伤而沉重，和我们从小听到的政治宣传音乐很不一样

Her writing showed me, and continues to show me, that history, `vulnerable to` the attacks of misused and misleading language, can be protected by the language that `achieves the purity of truth`
她的作品向我展示了，而且还在继续向我展示，历史容易遭到被误用和误导的语言的攻击，但是具有真理纯洁性的语言也可以保护它

History can be `manipulated, whitewashed` and rewritten
历史是可以被操纵、粉饰和重写的

`The veiled threat`, broadcast over state-run news media this week as President Trump `ratcheted up` his trade war against Beijing, was clear
在特朗普总统加强与北京方面的贸易战之际，这种隐晦的威胁本周通过官方新闻媒体播出，其义自现

Other trading partners, `notably` Japan and South Korea, could become `collateral damage`. And in `an odd turnabout`, China’s own needs have made it somewhat `dependent on ore` from the United States.
其他贸易伙伴可能遭受附带伤害，尤其是日本和韩国。此外颇为不巧的是，中国自身的需求已使其多少依赖于美国的矿石

It is `far from clear` that China will `harness rare earths` as a weapon
目前还不清楚中国是否会动用稀土这一武器

The minerals `wind up in everything` from iPhones to wind `turbines` and missiles. They are used to `polish camera lenses` and to `refine crude oil` into gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.
这些矿物最终出现在从iPhone到风力涡轮机、导弹等各种产品里。它们被用于抛光照相机镜头，以及将原油提炼为汽油、柴油和喷气燃料

The `appetite` in the United States for products that include rare earths is enormous. But while the country still imports large quantities of cheap `rare-earth catalysts` for use in oil refineries
美国对含稀土产品的需求十分庞大。然而，尽管美国仍进口大量炼油厂使用的廉价稀土催化剂

`In large part`, that is because so much manufacturing has `shifted out of` the United States. Nearly a decade ago, Beijing began `putting heavy pressure on` manufacturers of products like `electric motor magnets and light-emitting diodes` to move factories to China
在很大程度上，这是因为太多制造业务已转移出美国。近十年前，北京当局开始给电机磁铁和发光二极管等产品制造商大力施压

The `dilemma` for Beijing `lies in whether to jeopardize` its central role in `global supply chains` by `halting exports` of crucial components to the West
北京的困境在于，是否要中断关键零部件对西方的出口，进而危及它在全球供应链中的核心地位

A Chinese `export embargo` would have other `drawbacks`
中国的出口禁令还会有其他弊端

That plan is `based partly on his assessment` that `trade frictions will persist` and that the United States will `seek self-sufficiency`
该计划部分基于他的评估，即贸易摩擦将持续存在，美国将寻求自给自足

The global economy is going to `bifurcate into` the U.S. bloc and the China bloc
全球经济将分化为美国集团和中国集团

China so `completely dominates` one key stage of the manufacturing process ― converting the `oxides to metals` ― and has so much `low-cost overcapacity` that companies elsewhere `are leery of investing` in their own facilities
中国在制造过程的一个关键阶段――将氧化物转化为金属――完全占据主导地位，而且存在大量低成本过剩产能，因此其它国家的企业不敢投资自己的工厂

We’re a long way off, We’re nowhere
我们落后很多，我们什么进展也没有

And there’s evidence that Beijing has been trying to `prop the currency up, rather than weaken it drastically`.
有证据表明，中国政府一直在努力支撑人民币，而不是令人民币大幅贬值

`By definition`, any analysis of the movements of China’s currency `is partly a guessing game`. 
从本质上说，任何对人民币走势的分析在一定程度上都是猜谜游戏

`for relatively straightforward reasons`: They’re designed to cut the exports of the country on which they’re `levied`, in this case China’s exports to the United States.
原因相对简单：关税旨在削减被征收国的出口，在当前情况下，就是中国对美国的出口

`A vicious cycle` can follow a falling currency
货币贬值可能导致恶性循环

`The dour outlook` for the economy may also be `prompting` some global investors to `pull money out of` China
黯淡的经济前景也可能促使一些全球投资者将资金撤出中国

A weakening renminbi itself can also `spur capital outflows` from wealthy Chinese seeking to protect their savings from `devaluation`
人民币贬值本身也可能刺激中国富人的资本外流，他们希望保护自己的储蓄不受贬值影响

China’s `stockpile of dollars` is another clue
中国的美元储备是另一个线索

The trade conflict between the United States and China has `become so caustic that` the two countries `cannot even agree` if they are talking.
美中两国之间的贸易冲突已变得如此尖锐，以至于两国甚至无法就它们是否在谈判达成一致

`The alleged overtures` would have come hours after Mr. Trump `raised tariffs on Chinese imports`
这一所谓的示好到来前几小时，特朗普提高了对中国进口商品的关税

President Trump `jolted markets` and `left world leaders scratching their heads` on Monday 
这个说法震动了市场，也让其他世界领导人摸不着头脑

The back and forth capped a `whiplash-inducing` 72 hours in the trade war 
这番来回应对让贸易战中急速转变的72小时达到高潮

It also left Mr. Trump’s `top economic aides` straining to back up the president without `contradicting him`
它还让特朗普的最高经济助手在支持他的同时，竭力不和他的说法相矛盾

Mr. Trump `has a long history of citing` telephone overtures from `unnamed callers to buttress an argument`
特朗普一直爱引用不具体说明来电者是谁的电话示好来支持自己的论点

The confusion over the China calls left commentators in the United States and China `grasping for answers` about whether one side was lying or if something was lost in translation
中国来电一事造成的困惑，让美中两国的评论人士争相猜测，是一方在撒谎，还是翻译中漏掉了一些东西

The two sides have been `keeping contact at technical level`, it doesn’t have `significance` that President Trump suggested
双方在技术层面一直保持着联络，但没有特朗普总统所暗示的重大意义

What he’s saying is, ‘Hey, I’ll deal.’ People are so `obtuse`
他的意思是，‘嘿，我可以谈。’大家太迟钝了

`stocks plunged` on Friday amid news that China and the United States were both `ratcheting up tariffs`
中美提高关税的消息导致上周五股市暴跌

some analysts said `the relatively modest uptick` showed that investors were not going to be `mollified` by Mr. Trump’s `offhand statements` given how quickly his views `tend to shift`
有一些分析师表示，`有限的涨幅`表明，鉴于特朗普的观点往往多变，投资者不会因他随口一说而得到抚慰

They are `paying less attention to remarks` that `lack specificity` from American officials
他们不大重视美国官员语焉不详的言论

Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Kudlow are “`having much less effect on pumping the market` as they used to, and Trump as well,” 
马努钦和库德洛“对推动市场方面的影响已不比过去，特朗普也是

It makes short-term investing a nightmare and long-term investment `draining`
这让短期投资像噩梦一样，并且让长期投资枯竭

`The volatility` is unlikely to stabilize `anytime soon`. Mr. Trump `made clear this week that` he views his ability to `sow instability as a feature rather than a bug`
这种波动性在短期内稳定下来的可能性不大。特朗普本周明确表示，他认为自己播下不稳定种子的能力是特色，而非缺陷

`True enough`, and people often say that `China will never kill the goose that lays golden eggs`. But as Chris Patten once `dryly noted`, that `phrase came into existence` only because “history `is littered with the carcasses of decapitated geese`.”
完全没错，人们也常说中国绝不会杀会生金蛋的鹅。但正如曾经冷冷地指出的，这个习语之所以存在，是因为“历史满是被砍头的鹅的尸体。”
