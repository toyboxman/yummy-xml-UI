`If you’re depressed by` the state of the world, let me `toss out an idea`: In `the long arc of human history`, 2019 has been the best year ever
如果世界的现状使你感到沮丧，请听听我的一个想法：在人类历史的长弧中，2019年是有史以来最好的一年

The bad things that you `fret about` are true. But 2019 was probably the year in which children were `least likely to die`, adults were `least likely to be illiterate` and people were least likely to `suffer excruciating and disfiguring diseases`
那些让你烦恼的坏事是真的。但2019年几乎肯定是儿童死亡的可能性最小、成人文盲的可能性最小，以及人类遭受极痛苦、损毁外形的疾病可能性最小的一年
