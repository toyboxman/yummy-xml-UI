`If you’re depressed by` the state of the world, let me `toss out an idea`: In `the long arc of human history`, 2019 has been the best year ever
如果世界的现状使你感到沮丧，请听听我的一个想法：在人类历史的长弧中，2019年是有史以来最好的一年

The bad things that you `fret about` are true. But 2019 was probably the year in which children were `least likely to die`, adults were `least likely to be illiterate` and people were least likely to `suffer excruciating and disfiguring diseases`
那些让你烦恼的坏事是真的。但2019年几乎肯定是儿童死亡的可能性最小、成人文盲的可能性最小，以及人类遭受极痛苦、损毁外形的疾病可能性最小的一年

Every single day in recent years, another 325,000 people `got their first access to electricity`. Each day, more than 200,000 `got piped water` for the first time. And some 650,000 `went online` for the first time, every single day
在最近几年里，每天都有32.5万人首次用上电。每天都有超过20万人首次获得自来水。每天都有65万人第一次上网

`If you were given the opportunity` to choose the time you were born in, `it’d be pretty risky` to choose a time in any of the thousands of generations in the past, Almost everyone `lived in poverty, hunger was widespread and famines common`
如果你有机会选择自己的出生时间，选择在过去几千代人中的任何时间都有相当大的风险，过去，几乎每个人都生活在贫困中，饥饿是普遍现象，饥荒经常发生

Diseases like `polio, leprosy, river blindness and elephantiasis` are `on the decline`, and global efforts have `turned the tide on AIDS`
脊髓灰质炎、麻风病、河盲症和象皮病等疾病正在减少，而且，全球的努力已经扭转了艾滋病的形势

You may `feel uncomfortable reading this`. It can `seem tasteless, misleading or counterproductive to hail progress` when there is still so much wrong with the world
读到这里，你可能会感到不舒服。在世界仍存在如此多问题的情况下，欢呼进步似乎不得体、存在误导或产生适得其反的效果

But I worry that `deep pessimism` about the state of the world is `paralyzing rather than empowering`; `excessive pessimism` can leave people feeling `not just hopeless but also helpless`
但我担心，对世界现状的深度悲观让人麻痹，而不是增强人们的力量；过度悲观不仅让人感到绝望，也让人感到无助

They don’t realize that when parents `are confident that` their children will survive, and `have access to birth control`, they have fewer children
他们没有意识到，当父母相信他们的孩子会活下来，而且父母有控制生育的手段时，他们会生更少的孩子

Recognizing that progress is possible can `be a spur to do more`, and that’s why I `write this annual reminder` of gains against the common enemies of humanity
认识到进步的可能，能激励我们作出更大的努力，这就是我为什么每年写篇文章来提醒人们，我们在对抗人类共同敌人上取得的进展

我也从许多人――尤其是年轻人――展现的让世界变得更美好的热情中找回信心

I recently published my annual “gifts with meaning” guide and suggested four organizations to support `in lieu of traditional presents`
我最近发表了我的年度“有意义的礼物”指南，建议向四个组织捐款来取代传统礼物

So I promise to `tear my hair out every other day`, but let’s `interrupt our gloom for a nanosecond` to note what historians may eventually see as the most important trend in the world in the early 21st century: our progress toward `elimination of hideous diseases, illiteracy and the most extreme poverty`
所以我保证，我还会在我每隔一天的专栏里为世界发愁，但让我们打断这种忧郁片刻，来看看最终可能会被历史学家视为21世纪初世界上最重要的一个趋势：我们在消除可怕的疾病、文盲和极端贫困上取得的进步

By the time I die, `illiteracy and extreme poverty may be almost eliminated` ― and it’s difficult to imagine `a greater triumph` for humanity `on our watch`
到我死的时候，文盲和极度贫困有可能差不多已被消除。很难想像人类社会在我们的注视下，取得比这更大的胜利

He was describing how `sea cucumbers`, `the unlovely cousins of starfish and sea urchins`, `end up on the tables` of the Chinese today

Sea cucumbers have been `highly prized for centuries` for their `nutritional value and texture`, if not their flavor. They are believed to `have medicinal properties`, `treating ailments from arthritis to impotency`
海参数百年来不仅因为口味，还因为其营养价值和口感而备受推崇。人们相信它还有药用特性，可以治疗从关节炎到阳痿的各种疾病

They are also good for the environment, `feeding off the rocks and sand` where they live, `purifying the surrounding water`. Their `eradication` would be `devastating up and down the food chain`
它们还有益于环境，以它们所附着的岩石和沙子为食，净化了周围的海水。它们的灭绝将从上至下破坏整个食物链

把从海中现捞的海参稍微焯一下，蘸上蒜末、香菜和辣椒油――附近的小海鲜店里就是这么做的――味道尝起来就像一块有弹性的软骨，再蘸点蒜末、香菜和辣椒油
