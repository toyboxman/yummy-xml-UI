`If you’re depressed by` the state of the world, let me `toss out an idea`: In `the long arc of human history`, 2019 has been the best year ever
如果世界的现状使你感到沮丧，请听听我的一个想法：在人类历史的长弧中，2019年是有史以来最好的一年

The bad things that you `fret about` are true. But 2019 was probably the year in which children were `least likely to die`, adults were `least likely to be illiterate` and people were least likely to `suffer excruciating and disfiguring diseases`
那些让你烦恼的坏事是真的。但2019年几乎肯定是儿童死亡的可能性最小、成人文盲的可能性最小，以及人类遭受极痛苦、损毁外形的疾病可能性最小的一年

Every single day in recent years, another 325,000 people `got their first access to electricity`. Each day, more than 200,000 `got piped water` for the first time. And some 650,000 `went online` for the first time, every single day
在最近几年里，每天都有32.5万人首次用上电。每天都有超过20万人首次获得自来水。每天都有65万人第一次上网

`If you were given the opportunity` to choose the time you were born in, `it’d be pretty risky` to choose a time in any of the thousands of generations in the past, Almost everyone `lived in poverty, hunger was widespread and famines common`
如果你有机会选择自己的出生时间，选择在过去几千代人中的任何时间都有相当大的风险，过去，几乎每个人都生活在贫困中，饥饿是普遍现象，饥荒经常发生

Diseases like `polio, leprosy, river blindness and elephantiasis` are `on the decline`, and global efforts have `turned the tide on AIDS`
脊髓灰质炎、麻风病、河盲症和象皮病等疾病正在减少，而且，全球的努力已经扭转了艾滋病的形势

You may `feel uncomfortable reading this`. It can `seem tasteless, misleading or counterproductive to hail progress` when there is still so much wrong with the world
读到这里，你可能会感到不舒服。在世界仍存在如此多问题的情况下，欢呼进步似乎不得体、存在误导或产生适得其反的效果

But I worry that `deep pessimism` about the state of the world is `paralyzing rather than empowering`; `excessive pessimism` can leave people feeling `not just hopeless but also helpless`
但我担心，对世界现状的深度悲观让人麻痹，而不是增强人们的力量；过度悲观不仅让人感到绝望，也让人感到无助

They don’t realize that when parents `are confident that` their children will survive, and `have access to birth control`, they have fewer children
他们没有意识到，当父母相信他们的孩子会活下来，而且父母有控制生育的手段时，他们会生更少的孩子

Recognizing that progress is possible can `be a spur to do more`, and that’s why I `write this annual reminder` of gains against the common enemies of humanity
认识到进步的可能，能激励我们作出更大的努力，这就是我为什么每年写篇文章来提醒人们，我们在对抗人类共同敌人上取得的进展

We’ll `get a morale boost` if we `acknowledge the backdrop of hard-won improvement`
如果我们承认有来之不易的进步这个背景的话，我们将提升士气

I also `take heart from the passion` so many — especially young people — show to make the world a better place. 
我也从许多人——尤其是年轻人——展现的让世界变得更美好的热情中找回信心

I recently published my annual “gifts with meaning” guide and suggested four organizations to support `in lieu of traditional presents`
我最近发表了我的年度“有意义的礼物”指南，建议向四个组织捐款来取代传统礼物

So I promise to `tear my hair out every other day`, but let’s `interrupt our gloom for a nanosecond` to note what historians may eventually see as the most important trend in the world in the early 21st century: our progress toward `elimination of hideous diseases, illiteracy and the most extreme poverty`
所以我保证，我还会在我每隔一天的专栏里为世界发愁，但让我们打断这种忧郁片刻，来看看最终可能会被历史学家视为21世纪初世界上最重要的一个趋势：我们在消除可怕的疾病、文盲和极端贫困上取得的进步

By the time I die, `illiteracy and extreme poverty may be almost eliminated` — and it’s difficult to imagine `a greater triumph` for humanity `on our watch`
到我死的时候，文盲和极度贫困有可能差不多已被消除。很难想像人类社会在我们的注视下，取得比这更大的胜利

He was describing how `sea cucumbers`, `the unlovely cousins of starfish and sea urchins`, `end up on the tables` of the Chinese today
他说的是海参，这个海星和海胆的丑亲戚，是怎么上了现在中国人的餐桌的

“Some are raised `in pens`,” Mr. Cong said, `wearing blue overalls and white rubber boots`, and standing outside `a long cinder-block building` that contained 54 pools filled with sea cucumbers, `redolent of the sea`. “And some are `free range`.”
“有些是圈养的，”丛选枝说。他穿着蓝色的连体工作服和白色的橡胶靴，站在一个长长的砖房外面，里面是54个充满海参的水池，散发着海水的气味。“有些是散养的”

That’s `a figure of speech`, strictly speaking, since the creatures `barely move in their lives`
严格来说，这只是一种比喻，因为这些生物在生活中几乎不移动

In a few decades, demand `has all but depleted the natural stocks` of the local species
几十年来，野生的该物种已被人们的需求耗尽

Sea cucumbers have been `highly prized for centuries` for their `nutritional value and texture`, if not their flavor. They are believed to `have medicinal properties`, `treating ailments from arthritis to impotency`
海参数百年来不仅因为口味，还因为其营养价值和口感而备受推崇。人们相信它还有药用特性，可以治疗从关节炎到阳痿的各种疾病

They are also good for the environment, `feeding off the rocks and sand` where they live, `purifying the surrounding water`. Their `eradication` would be `devastating up and down the food chain`
它们还有益于环境，以它们所附着的岩石和沙子为食，净化了周围的海水。它们的灭绝将从上至下破坏整个食物链

`Given the Chinese belief` that one can `reinforce a specific part` of the body by eating food that are `in a similar shape`
中国人认为身体某个部分可以通过食用相似形状的食物而强健，这可能有助于它当时作为食材的流行

During `the peak harvest season`, as `fall turns into winter`, divers `plunge into water` that is about 48 `degrees Fahrenheit`, coming up for only short breaks to `unload their mesh nets`
收获季节的高峰期是在秋冬转换的时候，潜水员进入大约48华氏度（约为8.89摄氏度）的水中工作，只能短暂出水片刻，卸下渔网捕捞到的东西

When `plucked alive` from the sea, `blanched lightly and bathed in`, say, a sauce of garlic, `cilantro and chili oil` — as they `are served at` a small fish restaurant not far away — they `taste like a rubbery piece of cartilage`, bathed in a sauce of garlic, cilantro and chili oil.
把从海中现捞的海参稍微焯一下，蘸上蒜末、香菜和辣椒油——附近的小海鲜店里就是这么做的——味道尝起来就像一块有弹性的软骨，再蘸点蒜末、香菜和辣椒油

Mr. Xu’s note `was rich in metaphors` describing the difficult days ahead. Alternately `likening the company to plums bitten` by winter’s frost, `a bamboo stalk battered by wind` and an `embattled aircraft`
徐直军的致辞也充满了用来描述未来艰难日子的隐喻。这位高管时而把公司比作严冬霜打下的梅花，时而将其比作被狂风吹打的竹子，时而又将其比作艰苦作战中的飞机

`Even so`, Mr. Xu indicated that the confrontation with the United States would `continue to dampen growth` and said he expected Huawei to remain on the blacklist in 2020
即便如此，徐直军仍表示与美国的对抗将继续抑制增长，并称他预计2020年华为将继续被列入“实体清单”

Difficulty is `the prelude` to greater success, and `adversity the whetstone of an iron-willed team`
困难从来都是更大胜利的前奏，挑战更是坚强队伍的磨刀石

Huawei, he said, will “`need to go all out`” to develop software and services that work with its smartphones
他说，华为将“需要全力”开发与智能手机兼容的软件和服务

The company’s shares are not `publicly traded` and it `has no obligation to` announce its results. `In a nod to transparency`, Huawei has long announced financials, and this year it began reporting unaudited results quarterly
华为并未上市，因此没有公布财报的义务。为了提高透明度，该公司长期以来一直对外公布财务数据，并于今年开始公开了未经审计的季度财报

The experience `struck a chord` for many Chinese white-collar tech employees, who are now `facing sagging returns` for long hours at the office
此事也引起了中国科技行业许多白领员工的共鸣，他们同样面临着长时间加班却难以获得回报的困境

Despite `the renewed focus` on Huawei’s famous `hard-charging corporate spirit`, Mr. Xu did not `mince his metaphors` in describing the company’s outlook on its employees
尽管人们开始重新关注华为著名的“狼性”文化，但在描述公司对员工的期望时，徐直军没有拐弯抹角

“Managers at all levels need to `put company interests above personal gain` and go where they are `needed most`, including hardship regions,” he wrote, calling those willing to `put up with` such difficulties “tree growers.”
“各级干部要以公司大局为重，上火线、下战壕，到业务最需要的地方，到艰苦区域作战，”他这样写道，并承诺将把愿意“栽树并持续贡献的”人提拔上来

“We will remove `mediocre managers` more quickly — people who have `lost their enterprising spirit`, who have `built their position on personal connections` or `empty and unactionable reporting`, and those who `prioritize short-term gains and pass problems on to` their successors,” he wrote, calling such people “`the pit-diggers` among us.”
华为将“加快对平庸干部淘汰，坚决把不思进取、靠混关系、做报告坐上管理岗位、历史上挖过坑的干部撤下来”，他写道

The Chinese book world is `cautiously optimistic` that `the partial trade truce` reached this month between Beijing and Washington will `break the logjam`
中国出版界谨慎乐观地认为，本月北京与华盛顿之间达成的局部贸易停战将结束这一停滞局面

People in the publishing industry `are reluctant to` discuss publicly which books have been `held up` for fear that Beijing will target them for speaking out. Many spoke `on condition of anonymity`
由于担心被针对，出版业人士不愿公开讨论哪些书被搁置。许多人要求匿名

“China and Japan,” about `the turbulent history` between the Asian giants by the `influential Sinologist` Ezra Vogel
汉学大家傅高义(Ezra Vogel)的《中国与日本》(China and Japan)，关于两个亚洲巨人之间的动荡历史

Still, publishing industry `insiders` describe `a near freeze of regulatory approvals`, one that could make the publishing industry reluctant to `buy the rights to sell American books` in China
不过出版业的内部人士称，监管机构的审批几乎完全冻结，这导致出版业不愿意购买美国图书在华销售的版权

His `autobiography` had been `scrubbed of mentions of` the Arab Spring protests and other material
其自传中，提及阿拉伯之春抗议活动等内容的部分已被删除

`Given the vast gulf` in understanding and communication between the U.S. and China, we should be worried about any `narrowing of the flow of information`
鉴于中美两国之间在理解和沟通方面存在的巨大鸿沟，我们有理由担心信息流通的缩窄

Peter Navarro, his `hawkish trade adviser`, was ready with `a flurry of arguments` against the move
鹰派贸易顾问彼得·纳瓦罗已准备好用一系列的论点反对此举

It was a familiar argument for Mr. Trump’s top trade adviser, who has spent the past three years `fanning the president’s protectionist instincts` and encouraging him to `embark on` a punishing trade war with China
特朗普首席贸易顾问的论点并不令人陌生，过去三年，他一直煽动总统的保护主义本能，鼓励总统与中国开展惩罚性的贸易战

Mr. Trump `dismissed Mr. Navarro’s concerns`, `opting for` an initial deal with China
特朗普不理会纳瓦罗的担忧，选择与中国达成初步协议

`What happens in the Oval should stay in the Oval`, both for `the sanctity and security` of the internal discussions and `for the good of the country`
为了内部讨论的神圣性和安全性，也为了国家的利益，椭圆形办公室发生的事情不应外传

An academic `with little previous government or business experience`, Mr. Navarro has `managed to exert enormous influence over` United States trade policy by `tapping into` the president’s `disdain for globalization`
纳瓦罗是一位几乎没有政府和商业经验的学者，他利用总统对全球化的蔑视，成功对美国贸易政策施加了巨大影响

For all the criticism he gets from `the free trade wing of` the Republican Party, he was one of the first people to `ring the alarm` on China years ago
尽管共和党自由贸易派对他做出了各种批评，但他仍是多年前首先敲响中国警钟的人之一

He’s helped `step up inspections` of Chinese packages to `crack down on online counterfeiting` and gotten involved with a project to `revive American shipyards`
他帮助加强了对中国包裹的检查，以打击网络假冒产品，并参与了一个重振美国造船厂的项目

You don’t need to be `a big bloated bureaucracy`. All you need be is `lean and flat and nimble` enough to `harness agency resources` for the president and his agenda
你不需要成为一个臃肿的官僚机构。你需要做的就是精简、扁平化和灵活地利用机构资源，为总统和他的议程服务

VMware, `the jewel in the crown` at Dell Technologies, is one of the cheapest tech stocks you can buy right now
VMware公司是Dell旗下如同王冠上的宝石，一个最便宜的你能够现在投资的技术股票

But TikTok’s popularity and its roots in China, where no large corporation can `thrive outside the good graces of the government`, have `prompted intense scrutiny` of the app’s content policies and data practices
但是TikTok源于中国，在那里，任何一家大公司没有获得政府的好感是难以茁壮成长的，加之TikTok的流行程度，这促使人们对该应用程序的内容政策和数据实践进行了严格审查

TikTok agreed to pay $5.7 million to `settle the complaint` and said it would `abide by` COPPA(Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act)
TikTok同意支付570万美元达成和解，并表示将遵守《儿童在线隐私保护法》

Dinat Yur `is fed up with living` in a place where `winters drag on` for six months and the average `annual temperature is below freezing`
迪纳特·尤尔也厌倦了生活在这样一个地方：冬季长达六个月，年平均气温低于冰点

`Born and raised in` a city proud of `its resilience against climatic` and `all other odds`, Mr. Yur has for the moment found `his calling in a defiantly contrarian occupation` for a place so cold: He makes ice cream
尤尔出生并成长在一个以抵御恶劣气候和其他种种不利因素为荣的城市，如今，他的使命是在一个这么冷的地方从事一项一反常规的事业：制作冰淇淋

He `was hard at work` mixing milk, sugar and `a raspberry mush imported` from Italy to produce `a summery swirl of frozen gelato`
尤尔在辛勤地劳作着，把牛奶、糖和意大利进口的覆盆子糊做成一个充满夏日风情的意式冰激凌漩涡

Eating his `confections outside` during winter, Mr. Yur `conceded, is not a good idea` — they quickly turn to `teeth-cracking chunks of ice`
尤尔承认，冬天在室外吃他的甜品不是什么好主意——它们很快就会变成能崩碎牙齿的大冰块

Russia’s `curious love affair with ice cream` has long been a subject of `theorizing about` how a country `plagued by such terrible weather` and other `miserable conditions` `manages to keep going`, `prevailing over seemingly unsurmountable hurdles`
长期以来，人们一直在试图理解，一个如此饱受恶劣天气和其他恶劣条件折磨的国家，是怎么克服看似无法逾越的障碍努力前行的，而其国民对冰激凌的热爱就是课题之一

`Particularly popular in Russia is a story`, probably `apocryphal`, about a visit to Moscow in the winter of 1944 by Winston Churchill
在俄罗斯流行着一个可能是杜撰的故事，1944年冬天温斯顿·丘吉尔访问莫斯科

Moscow, however, has winters that usually `hover in the 20s Fahrenheit` — meaning that Magadan is `pushing the limits of this against-the-odds spirit`
然而，莫斯科的冬天通常在零下六摄氏度左右徘徊——这意味着马加丹是在挑战这种不畏困难精神的极限

Only Russians never rushed to Magadan; they `were dragged there`. The only `recent rush has been to the exit`. Young people particularly are `making a run for it, a stampede`
只是俄罗斯人并不是涌向马加丹，而是被拖到那里去的. 最近，那里唯一的热潮是人们竞相离开的浪潮. 年轻人尤其心急

`Aside from its bleak weather` and even bleaker history, Magadan is, `if truth be told`, no worse — and `in some respects better` — than many provincial Russian towns
说实话，除了荒凉的天气和更荒凉的历史，马加丹不比许多俄罗斯地方城镇差，并且在某些方面还更好

`Another plus` is climate change, which is `making winters somewhat milder`
还有个加分项是气候变化让这里的冬天稍微没那么可怕了

But for many people in Magadan, the end of the Soviet Union meant `economic ruin`. The `slashing of` Soviet-era subsidies `sent Magadan salaries tumbling`
但是对于马加丹州的许多人来说，苏联的解体意味着经济的崩溃。苏联时期的补贴被大幅削减，使马加丹的薪水大跌

Mr. Putin, though, has `done the opposite`, stressing the importance of `keeping remote northern outposts alive`, `no matter the cost`. His `calculations include` security, patriotic pride in Russia’s reach, and economics: Most of Russia’s `natural resources lie beneath the ice` and snow of places like Magadan and the nearby wilds.
不过，普京却做了相反的事情，他强调不计代价保住这个偏远的北部居住地的活力。他的筹算包括安全，对俄罗斯的爱国自豪感和经济因素：俄罗斯的大部分自然资源都位于马加丹和附近野外的冰雪覆盖下

Government subsidies also help keep `the interest rate on mortgages` in town much lower than in warmer parts of Russia
政府补贴还有助于使当地城镇抵押贷款的利率保持在远低于俄罗斯温暖地区的水平

While Magadan `is blessed with` rich supplies of gold, silver and other natural resources, conditions are `so harsh that` some economists still question
尽管马加丹拥有丰富的黄金、银和其他自然资源，但条件如此恶劣，以至于一些经济学家仍在质疑

To `lift flagging spirits`, municipal buses `are emblazoned with a defiant statement` of the city’s will to survive: “Magadan was, is and will be.”
为了振作精神，公交车上醒目地展示着对城市生存意愿的抗争声明：“马加丹有曾经，有现在，也有未来。”

The phrase `borrows, inauspiciously, from a less-than-successful Soviet-era slogan` once plastered across the country: “Lenin lived, lives and will live!”
这句话不太吉利地借用了曾经在全国范围宣传的、不太成功的苏联时代口号：“列宁活在过去，活在现在，也将永远活在未来！”

For days, Li Bin `had what felt like a cold`, with a high fever of between 102 and 105
几天来，李斌一直感冒，高烧在38.8到40.5度之间

A doctor told him he had `a form of viral pneumonia`, without offering `specifics`. Mr. Li, 42, was hospitalized, then transferred to another facility and `quarantined with` other patients who had similarly unexplained symptoms
医生告诉他，他患有某种形式的病毒性肺炎，但没有提供具体信息。42岁的李斌住院后，被转移到另一家医院，与其他有相似症状、病因不明的患者一起隔离

The cases have `alarmed Chinese officials`, who are `racing to unravel the mystery` behind them in a region where the memory of an outbreak of `the dangerous respiratory disease` known as SARS `remains fresh`
这些病例使中国官员感到担忧，他们正在努力找出这些神秘病例背后的原因，在该地区，被称作SARS的危险呼吸道疾病爆发的记忆还历历在目

Symptoms of the new illness include high fever, `difficulty breathing and lung lesions`, the city government said they had `ruled out` as causes SARS, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), bird flu and the adenovirus
新疾病的症状包括高烧、呼吸困难和肺部病变, 市政府表示，他们已经排除了SARS、中东呼吸综合征(MERS)、禽流感和腺病毒病原

Experts have said `contact with infected animals` was `the likeliest source of transmission`
专家说与被感染动物的接触是最可能的传播来源

Those `strains are particularly evident` in `the convenience store` industry. Japan’s `chains` have greatly expanded in recent years `in an effort to` capture market share at one another’s expense
这些压力在便利店行业中尤为明显。近年来，日本的连锁店已极速扩展，为了市场份额展开你死我活的竞争

While the expenses for the chains were minimal, the expansion `took a toll on the franchisees` who operate the vast majority of Japan’s more than 55,000 convenience stores
连锁企业的支出微乎其微，但扩张却给加盟商造成了损失，他们经营着日本5.5万多家便利店的绝大部分

Even back then, I `was preoccupied with` store operations, worrying about `sudden cancellation by part-time workers`. I had to hold a mobile phone while I `soaked in a spa`
即使在那时，我也得全神贯注于商店运营，担心兼职员工突然不来了。泡温泉时还必须得拿着手机

`Supportive customers have shown up to shop` among his remaining inventory, which includes snacks, instant noodles, `stationery items, detergents and cosmetics`
支持他的客人来到店里，在他剩余的存货中购买东西，其中包括零食、方便面、文具、清洁剂和化妆品

I just want to `disclose everything` in my case. I believe `the justice will be given`. That is why, he said, he plans to `fight to the bitter end.`
我只想公开我的全部情况。我相信会得到公正的对待. 他说，这就是为什么他打算战斗到最后一刻

Water is pretty boring, `as far as beverages go`. It doesn’t `have a catchy jingle`, a secret `family recipe` or even a taste, really. Yet people can’t `seem to get enough of it`
水是一种没什么意思的饮品。没有关于水的广告口水歌，没有水的家传秘方，它甚至连味道都没有，真的。可是人们好像怎么喝水都不够

Another warns that if you `feel thirsty`, you’re already `dehydrated`
还有一种建议警告说，如果你感到口渴，说明你已经脱水了

Feeling `sluggish`? You probably need more water. `Uninspired and utterly hopeless` about your career and `romantic prospects`? Well, have you had any water today?
觉得疲惫吗？你可能需要更多的水。事业和恋爱毫无灵感和希望？嗯，你今天喝水了吗？

People `hydrate as if` their reputations depend on it. They `dutifully carry water bottles` with them wherever they go, `draining and refilling them with gusto`
仿佛补水是一个关乎个人名誉的事。无论走到哪里，他们都忠实地随身携带水瓶，兴致勃勃地喝完水再灌满

A study published in 2015, of `72 male subjects`, found that `full-fat milk, skim milk` and orange juice kept people more hydrated than still water did
2015年发表的一项针对72名男性受试者的研究发现，全脂牛奶、脱脂牛奶和橙汁比饮用水的补水效果更好

`It’s no accident that` it’s No. 1, If you had to `put together a perfect scenario` and plan how to build a category this would have been it
它成为第一绝非偶然，这是建立完美场景，建立商品类别的好例子

In the 1970s, `ad campaigns` by Evian and Perrier introduced the concept of bottled water as `a high-end refreshment beverage`
1970年代，依云(Evian)和巴黎水(Perrier)的广告宣传引入了瓶装水概念，把它作为一种高端的、令人恢复活力的饮品

While consumers may have begun to `curb their intake` of `caffeinated or sugary beverages`, they `had no reason to` put a limit on `zero-calorie, thirst-quenching water`. And they were carrying it around with them, `on the go`
消费者可能会限制摄入咖啡因或含糖饮料，但他们没有理由限制零卡路里且解渴的水。他们去哪里都带着水

As `single-use plastic` water bottles `proliferated`, an `environmentally conscious response` emerged: reusable water bottles
随着一次性塑料水瓶的普及，可重复使用的水瓶这一环保意识也随之兴起

Water is a `go-to remedy` for a variety of `ailments`: exhaustion, headaches, `digestive problems, inflammation`, dry skin, `acne`.
水是治疗各种疾病的首选灵丹妙药：疲劳、头痛、消化不良、炎症、皮肤干燥、痤疮

`Still`, many consumers treat water like `an anti-aging potion`
尽管如此，许多消费者仍将水视为抗衰老的神物

Water `appears immune` to claims that its benefits are `overblown` — we need it to survive, after all. Its benefits have even become `a meme`. 
无论怎么说水的益处被夸大了，似乎都不会影响它——我们毕竟确实需要水才能生存。它的好处甚至成为了一种米姆

There are social media accounts dedicated to `berating their followers` for not drinking enough water
有一些社交媒体账号专门用来斥责关注者没有补充足够的水

Coffee is a `hydrating beverage`, If you’re drinking it, `let go of the guilt`. Enjoy it
咖啡是一种补水饮料，如果你喝了，就不要有负罪感。享受它

One friend `gutted her downstairs bedroom` to `house five of the kangaroos`. Ms. Pulis has kept the youngest joeys `in quilt pouches `in another’s living room
一位朋友把楼下卧室清空，安置了5只袋鼠。普利斯将最小的幼袋鼠们放在另一个客厅的棉布袋里

As wildfires have killed at least 24 people, destroyed more than 1,400 homes and `ravaged 15 million acres`, they have also `inflicted a grievous toll` on Australia’s `renowned wildlife`
野火已经造成至少24人丧生，1400多所房屋被毁，6万平方公里的土地遭到破坏，而且对澳大利亚著名的野生动植物造成了惨重的损失

`Quilters` in the Netherlands have `made mittens` for koalas with burned paws. New Zealanders are `stitching joey pouches and bat wraps`
荷兰的棉纺织者为爪子烧伤的考拉制作了手套。新西兰人正在缝制幼袋鼠布袋和蝙蝠襁褓

Some experts have `been dubious of` the high numbers that have spread widely on social media, which are based on estimates of `population densities of mammals`, birds and `reptiles` from previously published studies
一些专家对社交媒体上广泛传播的巨大数字表示怀疑，这些数字是从先前发表的研究中基于哺乳动物，鸟类和爬行动物的种群密度估算出来的

`The death toll is arrived at` by multiplying the number of animals expected to inhabit a given area by the total acreage burned.
死亡数字是用给定区域的预估动物数量乘以过火面积

A video taken by a reporter showed `the scorched corpses` of sheep and cows `strewn along a highway`. `Carcasses` like these have raised biological fears around the country
记者拍摄的一段视频显示，沿公路散落着烧焦的绵羊和母牛的尸体。这样的残骸在全国引起了人们对生物安全的恐慌

Farmers had to `put down burned livestock` at a time when drought had already made `earning a living` nearly impossible
在干旱已经使人们几乎无法谋生的时候，农民不得不杀死被烧伤的牲畜

Farmers in the nearby town of Bairnsdale said that `a cattle sale was planned` Thursday to `unload their remaining livestock`, some of which may be injured
附近城镇拜恩斯代尔的农民说，计划于周四进行家畜售卖，倾销剩余的牲畜，其中一些可能受了伤

Around the country, people have `banded together` to help feed, find and `rehabilitate survivors`
在全国各地，人们团结起来，帮助养活、寻找幸存动物，协助它们的康复

Americans would `be wise to brace for` war with Iran. `Full-scale conflict` is not a certainty, but the probability is higher than at any point in decades
美国最好为与伊朗的战争做好准备 全面冲突并不一定会发生，但它的可能性比几十年来的任何时候都要高

Instead, `predictably, it induced` Tehran to `lash out with` a series of increasingly `bold military provocations` against Sunni Arab and Western targets while restarting `important aspects` of its nuclear program
相反，可以预见的是，它促使德黑兰重新启动了其核计划的重要部分，同时对逊尼派阿拉伯人和西方目标进行了一系列日益大胆的军事挑衅

`In deciding to` eliminate General Suleimani, Mr. Trump and his team argue they were acting `in self-defense` to `thwart imminent attacks` on Americans in Iraq and the region
对于除掉苏莱曼尼将军的决定，特朗普和他的团队辩称，他们是在自卫，以制止即将对身在伊拉克和该地区的美国人发起的袭击

Even in this `critical instance`, the administration `failed to brief, much less consult`, bipartisan leaders in Congress
即使在这个关键时刻，本届政府也未能向国会的的两党领袖通报情况，更不用说征求意见了

To `assess the fallout` of killing General Suleimani, we must understand that the Iranian regime cannot survive internal dissent or sustain its powerful position in the region if it `backs down from` this provocation
为了评估杀害苏莱曼尼将军的后果，我们必须了解，如果伊朗在这次挑衅面前退却，伊朗政权将无法承受内部的分歧或维持在该地区的强大地位

`There is no hope` now to `revive, much less strengthen`, the Iran nuclear deal
现在已经没有希望恢复——更不用说加强——伊朗的核协议了

When Iran does respond, its response will likely be `multifaceted` and `occur at unpredictable times` and in multiple places
当伊朗真正做出回应时，可能会是多方面的，并且会在不可预测的时间和多个地方发生

Oil prices `rattled skittishly`, everyone suddenly monitored ships, and headlines `speculated that` Israel might attack Iran’s nuclear sites
油价波动不定，各方都突然跟踪船只往来，新闻大标题都是对以色列可能攻击伊朗核设施的猜测

My `piece featured scenes` of `distraught young people` gathering on crowded `intersections singing the national anthem` — suddenly everyone a terrified Iranian citizen rather than an `aspiring guitarist` or a `day laborer`
我在文章中展现的场景是心神狂乱的年轻人聚集在拥挤的十字路口唱国歌，大喊大叫的妈妈从超市买奶粉囤积——突然间，每个人都成了惊恐的伊朗公民，而不是有志成为吉他手的人、打短工的人

The American-backed 1953 `coup` destroyed both my grandfather and `great uncle’s careers`, until then in service of the government, and `sent the latter into exile`
1953年美国支持的伊朗政变，摧毁了原本在政府工作的祖父和叔祖父的职业，后者被迫流亡

In the 1980s, Iran `cultivated regional groups and militias hostile` to Washington, and encouraged them to take Westerners hostages and staged attacks through these networks
20世纪80年代，它扶植与华盛顿有敌意的地区组织和民兵，鼓励他们劫持西方人作人质，并通过这些网络发动袭击

He was `a pivotal figure` in `vanquishing` the Islamic State, helping `repel its rapid march` across Iraq in 2014. In Syria, for the many Syrians who `endured the industrial-scale brutality` of the Assad regime, the general led what could only be understood as an offensive force
他是击败伊斯兰国的关键人物，在2014年帮助击退了伊斯兰国在伊拉克的快速挺进。在叙利亚，对于许多忍受了阿萨德政权工业化规模暴行的叙利亚人来说，这位将军领导的是一支只能被理解为进攻性的力量

It is for `these maneuvers`, `in part to provide Iran some deterrence` against relentless American hostility, that General Suleimani is remembered
这些策略部分是为了给伊朗提供一些抵抗美国无情敌意的威慑，苏莱曼尼正是因为这些策略而被人铭记

He had become `a patriarch` for an `ambivalent country adrift, forgiven`, at least by the hundreds of thousands who `turned out` for his funeral
他已成为一个充满矛盾、漫无目的的国家德高望重的长者，至少那些参加了他葬礼的几十万人宽恕了他指挥那支力量时过分强硬的做法

Even the reformist cleric Mehdi Karroubi, `an octogenarian` who `is confined under permanent house arrest, issued condolences`
甚至已被永久软禁的改革派教士、八十多岁的迈赫迪·卡鲁比也表示了哀悼

`In other words`, Trump’s latest attempt to bully another country `has backfired` — just like all his previous attempts.
换句话说，特朗普最近霸凌另一个国家的企图适得其反——就像他之前的所有事情一样

Trump has `acted on the apparent belief` that he could easily `intimidate foreign governments` — that they would `quickly fold` and allow themselves to `be humiliated`
特朗普的所作所为就是基于这样一个显然的信念：他可以轻易恐吓外国政府——他们会很快屈服，任凭他蒙羞

But this strategy keeps failing; the regimes he threatens are `strengthened rather than weakened`, and Trump is the one who `ends up making humiliating concessions`
但这种策略一直失败；他所威胁的政权得以加强，而不是遭到削弱，最终做出丢人现眼的让步的是特朗普自己

Or consider the trade war with China, which was supposed to `bring the Chinese to their knees`
或者想想同中国的贸易战，它的本意是让中国人屈服

`Ask yourself`, how would Americans have reacted if a foreign power had `assassinated Dick Cheney`, claiming that `he had the blood of` hundreds of thousands of Iraqis on his hands?
扪心自问，如果一个外国势力暗杀了迪克·切尼，声称他手上沾有成千上万伊拉克人的鲜血，美国人会作何反应

Even more important, however, was the fact that America was something more than a big country `throwing its weight around`. We always `stood for something larger`
然而，更重要的是，美国并非只是一个到处发号施令的大国。我们一直在捍卫的是某种更大的东西

Trump officials `seem taken aback` by the uniformly negative consequences of the Suleimani killing. But that’s what happens when you `betray` all your friends and `squander all your credibility`
特朗普的官员们似乎对苏莱曼尼被杀带来的一边倒的负面后果感到吃惊。但是，背叛自己所有的朋友，挥霍自己所有的信誉，就是会导致这样的后果

Trump, however, has `turned his back on everything` that used to make America great. Under his leadership, we’ve become `nothing more than a big, self-interested bully`
然而，特朗普却抛弃了所有曾经让美国伟大的东西。在他的领导下，我们变成了一个自私自利的大恶霸

Oh, and because we `were committed to enforcing rules`, we were also `relatively trustworthy`
哦对了，由于我们致力于执行规则，我们也会相对值得信赖

`The natural sugar` in `whole fruit (fructose)` is accompanied by `fiber and nutrients` and `makes a slow journey` through your body. But when sugar is added to beverages or `packaged foods`, it’s more quickly absorbed and burdens the liver
水果中的天然糖分（果糖）是由纤维和营养物质组成的，它会在你的体内缓慢代谢。但是，当糖被添加到饮料或包装食品中，它的吸收会更快，会加重肝脏负担

`Processed food is digested` quickly as soon as it enters our `intestines`. `Fiber-rich foods` like whole fruits break down slowly and `travel farther through the digestive track`, which triggers the release of `satiety hormones that make us feel full`
加工食品一旦进入肠道就会被迅速消化。而全果这类富含纤维的食物则会慢慢分解，在消化系统中停留更长时间，从而触发饱足荷尔蒙的释放，让我们感觉很饱

Bananas and grapes are particularly high in fructose `given the amount of fiber they contain`, so they give us `a faster sugar spike`
香蕉和葡萄的果糖含量特别高，因为它们含有大量的纤维，所以它们会让血糖飙升得更快

Dried fruit `is packed with nutrients`, but the drying process removes the water and `concentrates a lot of fruit sugar in` a very small `bite`. The risk is that it takes more dried fruit to `fill you up` than whole fruits
干果富含营养物质，但在干燥过程中，水分会流失，这样很小的一口干果里就浓缩了大量的果糖。风险在于，要想填饱肚子，就得吃下比全果更多的干果

`Raisins and dates` are about 60 to 65 percent sugar, `dried figs` and apricots are about 50 percent sugar, and `prunes` are about 38 percent sugar
葡萄干和枣干含有60%到65%的糖，无花果干和杏干含有50%的糖，梅干含有38%的糖

Another way to `weigh the pros and cons` of dried fruit is to look at `glycemic load`, a measure of how fast your body `converts a serving of food into sugar`
衡量干果利弊的另一种方法是看升糖指数，这个数值是用来衡量身体将一份食物转化为糖的速度

Strawberries, apricots, grapefruit, lemon, limes, cantaloupe, nectarines, oranges, pears, blueberries, peaches, plums, apples and pineapple have `glycemic loads of 6 or less`
草莓、杏子、葡萄柚、柠檬、酸橙、哈密瓜、油桃、橙子、梨、蓝莓、桃子、李子、苹果和菠萝的升糖指数不超过6

A quarter-cup of milk contains about `3 grams of` a natural sugar called lactose. The sugar in milk is not considered `an “added sugar`,” and it doesn’t `overwhelm the liver` the way added sugar does
四分之一杯牛奶含有约3克被称为乳糖的天然糖。牛奶中的糖不被认为是“添加糖”，它也不像添加糖那样加重肝脏负担

Adding milk or cream to your coffee and enjoying the naturally sweet taste of milk is a great way to `kick the added sugar habit` in the morning
在咖啡中加入牛奶或奶油，享受牛奶天然的甜味，这是从早上开始戒掉添加糖习惯的好方法

Over time you can `cut it in half` again and `wean yourself off` the sugar
随着时间的推移，你可以把糖再减半，让自己摆脱对糖的依赖

With so much added sugar `lurking in granola, cereals, pastries, breads and yogurts`, you might as well just call it `dessert`. But readers have `had a tough time figuring out alternatives` to popular grain-based breakfast foods
格兰诺拉麦片、麦片、糕点、面包和酸奶中都含有大量添加糖，不妨把它们称为甜点。常见的早餐食品以谷物为主，读者们很难找到替代品

Eggs are `a high-protein option`, and while they are also `high in cholesterol`, many people can probably `eat them in moderation `without worrying about heart risks
鸡蛋是提供高蛋白的选择，虽然它们也含有高胆固醇，但许多人也许可以适量食用，无需担心心脏风险

Consider eating `smoked salmon, tuna or chicken salad` for breakfast. `Make a vegan breakfast bowl` of sweet potatoes, beans and `avocado`
可以考虑早餐吃烟熏三文鱼、金枪鱼或鸡肉沙拉。或者用红薯、豆子和鳄梨(牛油果)做一份素食早餐

Try `plain, unsweetened yogurt` with `berries and nuts` or `sliced apples with sugar-free peanut butter`. Or just eat and `savor a whole orange` or make a fruit salad
尝试普通无糖酸奶，加入浆果和坚果，或者苹果片和无糖花生酱。要不就吃一个完整的橘子，或者做一份水果沙拉

Try a breakfast salad with avocado and `hard-boiled eggs`. Use `a big kale leaf` to make a breakfast `burrito or egg salad wrap`. `Experiment with cauliflower` to make `hash browns`. Bake a sweet potato and add salsa, yogurt or nuts
试试用鳄梨和煮鸡蛋做早餐沙拉。用一片大甘蓝叶做早餐卷或鸡蛋沙拉卷。试试做一个花椰菜版的土豆丝饼。烤一个红薯，加入调味汁、酸奶或坚果

Try `miso soup, butternut squash soup` or another variety of hot soup. You’d be surprised how great soup tastes on a winter morning
尝试味噌汤、南瓜浓汤，或者其他种类的热汤。在冬天的早晨，你会惊讶地发现汤的味道实在太好了

What about `steel-cut oats`? Or `regular oats`? Do they have added sugar?
钢切燕麦片怎么样？或者普通燕麦呢？它们加糖了吗？

Morning oat-eaters are `by far the biggest demographic` we’ve heard from since starting the Sugar Challenge
自从发起“无糖挑战”以来，反响最强烈的就是早餐吃燕麦片的群体了

Steel cut oats `are the least processed`, meaning they have more fiber and are the best choice. `Rolled oats have been partially cooked`, making them increase blood sugar faster. `Instant oats should be avoided`, because they will be rapidly converted to sugar
钢切燕麦片是其中加工最少的，这意味着它们含有更多纤维，是最好的选择。碾压燕麦已部分煮熟，因此升血糖更快。应避免食用速溶燕麦，因为它们会很快转化为糖分

The reward for doing a little extra research? Ms. McMullen gets to enjoy her `sprouted rye guilt-free and (mostly) sugar free`
多做点功课有什么好处？麦克马伦可以毫不内疚地享受（基本上）不含糖的发芽黑麦面包了

Some smaller companies have until 2021 to `comply with the rule`. As a result, you may see a mix of old and new `food labels` for another year. The new label will help consumers `distinguish between` sugars that occur naturally in foods and those that are added
一些规模较小的公司则是从2021年才开始遵守这一规定。因此，新的一年里，新旧食品标签都有可能看到。新标签将帮助消费者区分食物中天然存在的糖和添加糖

`As an example`, take a look at the label on `whole milk`, which shows 11 grams of sugar `in a one-cup serving`. That `sounds like a lot`, but the new label will make it clear that all that sugar `occurs naturally as lactose` and that the same cup of milk has zero grams of added sugar
以全脂牛奶标签为例，上面显示一份牛奶含有11克糖。看起来好像很多，但是新的标签将清楚地表明，所有糖都是天然乳糖，不含添加糖

`The spate of moves` offers some clues about Mr. Putin’s plans and priorities, but also raises questions about what may `lie ahead` for the Russian president
这一系列举动提供了一些线索，让人们可以了解普京的计划和优先事项，但也让人对这位俄罗斯总统可能面临的前景产生了疑问

Mr. Putin’s hold on power in Russia is `unrivaled`, built up over the last 20 years `in his posts` as president and prime minister.
普京对俄罗斯权力的掌控无人能及，这是他在过去20年担任总统和总理期间建立起来的

But Russia’s Constitution `bars a president from serving` more than `two consecutive terms`. To maintain his grip on power, as he has hinted he intends to do, Mr. Putin needs to find a way to `engineer a leadership transition` that will allow that to happen

This and other changes could `give Mr. Putin more leeway` to find a position in which he can maintain power without violating the Constitution

`A revamped State Council` could `become a vehicle` for Mr. Putin to maintain power if he `relinquishes the presidency`, particularly over the military and foreign policy
如果普京放弃总统职位，改组后的国务委员会可能会成为他维持权力的工具，特别是在军事和外交政策方面的权力

Despite Mr. Putin’s `immense sway`, he’d be taking a risk if he simply declared himself `president for life`
尽管普京拥有巨大的影响力，但简单地宣布自己是终身总统会是一种冒险

This time around, Mr. Putin `looks determined to orchestrate` his next move in `a slow-motion fashion` that’s less likely to produce `a backlash`
这一次，普京似乎下定决心要以一种不太可能引起强烈反对的慢动作来策划下一步行动

The changes to the Constitution he called for give him several options to hold on to power — while affording him as much as four years’ time to `set his course`
他呼吁修改宪法，这给了他几个继续掌权的选择，同时也给了他四年的时间来制定自己的路线

All of this means that the Kremlin is likely to `portray the resignation` on Wednesday of Mr. Medvedev and every cabinet minister as a sign that Mr. Putin has `heard Russians’ demand for change`
这一切意味着，克里姆林宫可能会把周三梅德韦杰夫和全体内阁的辞职描述为普京听取了俄罗斯人要求改变的信号

While Russians do increasingly blame Mr. Putin `for their ills`, many more blame `the bureaucrats below him`
尽管俄罗斯人确实越来越多地因他们的困境指责普京，但更多的人指向了他下面的官僚

`To drive home the point`, Mr. Putin proposed `a constitutional amendment` that offered the day’s clearest statement of how he views his successor
为了阐明这一点，普京提出了一项宪法修正案，给出了当天关于他对继任者看法的最清晰的声明

That was `an allusion` to Mr. Putin’s frequent charge the West is `fomenting political opposition` to undermine Russian sovereignty
这是在间接提及，普京多次指控西方国家煽动政治反动派破坏俄罗斯主权

China has `committed to buy` an additional $200 billion of American goods and services by 2021 and `crack down on business practices` that the Trump administration has criticized. But text of the accord does not provide enough information to `determine how it will work in practice`
中国承诺在2021年底前再购买2000亿美元的美国商品和服务，并对特朗普政府批评的商业行为进行打击。但协议文本没有提供足够的信息来确定它将如何落实

Mr. Trump said his deal is `a boon for farmers`, who have been among `the hardest hit` by his trade war
特朗普说，这笔交易对农民来说是一个福音，因为他们是受到贸易战打击最严重的群体之一

China is only agreeing to make purchases for the next two years and `is vague about what happens thereafter`
中国仅同意在未来两年进行采购，对之后会发生什么并不清晰

The agreement says the countries “`project that the trajectory`” of increased purchases would continue through 2025, but it remains to be seen how it will `actually play out`
协议说，两国“预计”增加购买量的“轨迹”将持续到2025年，但落实情况仍有待观察

Can it `get out of such commitments` if there isn’t `domestic demand`? Will the purchases `distort commodities markets`?
如果国内需求不存在，它能从这种承诺中脱身吗？这种购买是否会扭曲大宗商品市场？

Previous administrations have tried to get China to crack down on this practice `with limited success.`
先前的政府曾试图让中国严厉打击这种做法，但收效甚微

For instance, the deal requires China to “`enumerate additional acts constituting trade secret misappropriation`,” including “`electronic intrusions`,” a reference to hacking of computer systems
例如，该交易要求中国“列举构成商业机密盗用的其他行为”，包括“电子入侵”，指对计算机系统的黑客入侵

The agreement also aims to make it easier for companies to `seek redress` in China if they believe their trade secrets have been stolen. 
该协议还旨在让企业认为自己的商业机密被窃取的时候，更容易在中国寻求赔偿

`The pharmaceutical industry` appears to have `secured significant gains`, including commitments by the Chinese government to do more to protect patent owners from `copycats`
制药业似乎获得了重大收益，包括中国政府承诺采取更多措施保护专利所有者免受仿制品的损害

Among the biggest questions `going in to the negotiations` with China was how any agreement `would be enforced`. `Having watched `previous agreements with China fail to `live up to their promise`, many American experts and business executives `were skeptical` that the Trump administration could get China to keep the commitments it makes
与中国进行谈判的最大问题之一是协议将如何执行。目睹先前与中国达成的协议未能兑现承诺后，许多美国专家和企业高管对特朗普政府能否让中国信守承诺表示怀疑

The deal also includes `an appeals process` where issues can be `elevated from midlevel officials all the way up to` the offices of the United States trade representative and the vice premier of China
该协议还包括一个上诉程序，问题可以从中层官员一直提升到美国贸易代表和中国副总理办公室

If the United States or China believes that the other is acting `in bad faith`, either country can `give written notice and withdraw from the deal`
如果美国或中国认为对方背信弃义，则其中一方可以发出书面通知并退出交易

The Parties shall `work constructively to provide fair, effective, and nondiscriminatory market access` for each other’s services and services suppliers. `To that end`, the Parties shall take specific actions beginning with the actions `set forth in` this Chapter `with respect to` the financial services sector
双方应进行建设性的工作，给予对方的服务和服务提供者公平、有效、非歧视的市场准入待遇。为此，双方应从本金融服务章节约定的行动开始，采取具体行动

Even if China did approve their applications, it is not clear that those businesses would `make many inroads` in the country’s `advanced electronic payment system`, which `is dominated by` domestic companies
即使中国批准了它们的申请，也不清楚这些企业是否会在中国由国内企业主导的先进电子支付系统中取得很大进展

The Parties shall `refrain from competitive devaluations` and not target exchange rates for competitive purposes, including through `large-scale, persistent, one-sided intervention` in exchange markets
双方应避免竞争性贬值，避免将汇率用于竞争性目的，包括对外汇市场进行大规模、持续、单向干预

`Much of what` China is agreeing to do is `in line with commitments` it has already made through the Group of 20 and `its obligations` to the International Monetary Fund
中国同意采取的行动，在很大程度上符合它通过20国集团做出的承诺，以及它对国际货币基金组织的义务

Brad Setser, an economist at `the Council on Foreign Relations`, was `unimpressed by` the new currency provisions, `pointing out` that China is `primarily promising things` that it already does and that it will continue to `be circumspect about` its actual interventions
美国外交关系委员会经济学家布拉德·塞策对新的汇率条款不以为然，他指出，中国主要是在承诺它已经在做的事情，并将继续对其实际干预行动保持谨慎态度

Administration officials have said that they will not `lift those tariffs` until the countries `manage to agree to` a phase 2 agreement. `Prolonged strains` in the relationship could `prompt American firms to spend less` in China `and vice versa`
政府官员表示，在两国达成第二阶段协议之前，他们不会取消这些关税。长期的紧张关系会促使美国公司减少在中国的投资，反之亦然

PREAMBLE: REALIZING that it is in the interests of both countries that trade grow and that `there is adherence to international norms` `so as to` promote market-based outcomes
序言 : 认识到贸易增长和遵循国际规范、以促进基于市场的成果，符合两国的利益

A Chinese man in his 30s has `tested positive` for the `new coronavirus`, the Japanese health ministry said Thursday
日本厚生劳动省周四表示，一名30多岁的中国男子被检测出新型冠状病毒呈阳性

It is possible that the patient had `close contact with` an unknown patient with `lung inflammation while in China`
在中国期间，该患者可能与一名未知的肺炎患者密切接触过

The Wuhan health commission said on Wednesday that `the risk of a rapid spread of the virus among humans is low` but it could not `rule out the possibility of human-to-human transmission` of the virus. Officials also said they `detected the first cluster of` the virus involving members of a family
武汉市卫健委周三表示，该病毒在人类中迅速传播的风险很低，但不能排除该病毒在人际之间传播的可能性。官员们还说，他们发现了首批家庭聚集性病例

The World Health Organization has `reiterated that` there is no evidence of `human-to-human transmission of the virus`
世界卫生组织重申，没有证据表明该病毒在人与人之间传播

Experts say they want to know how the virus was transmitted to humans and `the incubation period` of the patients
专家说，他们想知道病毒是如何传播给人类的，以及患者的潜伏期有多长

While the new coronavirus appears to be `less virulent and deadly` than the virus that caused the 2003 `severe acute respiratory syndrome` outbreak, many questions remain
尽管这一新型冠状病毒似乎不如引起2003年严重急性呼吸系统综合征爆发的病毒那样剧烈和致命，但仍有很多问题未解

The whole trouble `with resolutions` is that keeping them is hard. Which makes sense: If it were easy to `keep a resolution, there would be no need to make one`
决心的全部问题在于难以坚持。这不难懂：如果坚持决心容易的话，就不叫决心了

In that spirit, I offer some `very doable resolutions` for l`iving more lightly on the earth`
本着这种精神，我建议一些切实可行的新年决心，让我们能更环保地生活在地球上

First, let’s `give credit where it is due`. Trump’s tough line on China has `shaken loose more apparent concessions` from the Chinese than previous administrations managed. 
首先，该给的称赞还是要给。比起前几任政府，特朗普对中国的强硬立场促使中国人给出更为明显的让步。

The previous, longstanding policy of `constructive engagement`, using `persuasion couched` in the language of mutual benefits, `bore little fruit`.
过去的长期建设性接触政策，以互惠互利的措辞进行说服，收效甚微

Why did China make these concessions? `Therein lies a deep irony`. Many of `the ostensible concessions` are in areas where Chinese reformers have long sought to create change `for their country’s own good.`
中国为什么作出这些让步？这其中就很有讽刺意味了。许多看上去是让步的地方，中国的改革者出于自身利弊的考量本来就打算改变了。

Even `a cease-fire`, and the prospects that further tariffs can be avoided, might help `mitigate the slump` in business sentiment and investment in China.
仅是休战，以及可以避免进一步征收关税的前景，都可能有助于缓解中国商业信心和投资的低迷

In that case, `all bets are off` and Washington wants Beijing to `override the market`
在这种情况下，一切皆有可能，并且华盛顿会想要北京去推翻市场的决定

These include China’s corporate subsidies, which `give its companies a leg up on` foreign competition, the dominance of state-owned enterprises in its economy
其中包括中国的企业补贴，这些补贴使中国企业在国外竞争中处于优势地位，使国有企业在经济中占主导地位

The deal with China and the recently `ratified` United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement `ought to help resolve that uncertainty`
与中国的协议以及最近正式批准的《美国-墨西哥-加拿大协议》应有助于解决这一不确定性

But given the Trump administration’s record of `mercurial policymaking`, `trade hostilities` could again `flare up` at the president’s `whim`, `undermining the certainty` businesses need before making decisions about their investments and supply chains
但是，鉴于特朗普政府在政策制定上一贯的反复无常，贸易敌对可能再次因总统的突发奇想而爆发，破坏企业在做出有关投资和供应链决策之前所需要的确定性

But China might `end up being the winner` when `the dust settles`
但尘埃落定后，中国可能成为最终赢家

Summer temperatures can approach 100 degrees, `with heavy humidity`. Its `traditional dish`, and one of China’s `favorite noshes, is a pungent pasta concoction called reganmian, or “hot dry noodles.”`
这里夏季气温可达100华氏度，湿度极大。它的传统菜肴——也是中国人最喜欢的小吃之一，是一种辛辣的面食，叫做热干面

`The boom has come with problems`. Heavy pollution has provoked protests. Its streets `are often clogged with traffic. `
繁荣之下，问题随之而来。严重的污染引发了抗议。它的街道经常被堵得水泄不通

Its steel factories, `long a backbone of the local economy`, have struggled along with the rest of the inefficient industry in China `with overcapacity and pollution problems`, leading Beijing to combine the state-owned local giant, Wuhan Steel, with another company.
武汉的钢铁厂长期以来一直是当地经济的支柱，但随着产能过剩和污染问题的出现，它们和中国其他效率低下的行业一样苦苦挣扎，北京方面最终将本地的国企巨头武钢与另一家公司合并

Wuhan held a special place in the heart of Mao Zedong, who famously took a swim in the Yangtze there in 1966 to `show his vitality`
武汉在毛泽东的心中享有特殊的地位。1966年，他曾在武汉的长江中游泳，以彰显自己的生命力，这件事很著名

Experts said `the stunning scale of the shutdown`, isolating a major urban `transit hub` larger than New York City, was without precedent.“It’s `an unbelievable undertaking`,” said Dr. Howard Markel
专家表示，此次封城相当于孤立了一个比纽约市还大的重要城市交通枢纽，规模之大令人震惊，这是史无前例的, “这是一项不可思议的工作”
