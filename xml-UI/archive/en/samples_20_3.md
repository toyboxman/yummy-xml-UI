The Defense Department should `capitalize on that resource surge to build breakthrough capabilities` in A.I., quantum, hypersonics and other `priority technology areas`
国防部应将这些资源投资到人工智能、量子物理、超音速技术和其他高优先级技术上，以创造领域水平上的突破

For example, a partnership should `expand affordable access` to cloud computing for university researchers and students. A new proposal from Stanford for a “National Research Cloud” `offers a vision` for this.
例如，应该建立一种合作伙伴关系，让大学研究人员和学生可以用上廉价的云计算。斯坦福大学的新提议“国家研究云”为该目标提供了一个思路

We can change the immigration process for `highly skilled people` now to `reduce the red tape, backlogs and uncertainty` that threaten to drive tech talent to other countries — including to our strategic competitors.
我们现在就可以改变高技能人才的移民程序，以减少官僚主义、积压和不确定性，这些都有可能将科技人才推向其他国家——包括我们的战略竞争对手

We should `accelerate discovery by creating more flexible ways` to fund `the most promising researchers` for multiple years at a time. This `opens longer-term paths` to scientific discovery
我们应该通过创造更灵活的方式来加速新发现，为最有前途的研究人员提供多年资助。这会为科学发现开辟更长远的道路

`Despite earnest efforts`, the tech community has not `demonstrated convincingly` that it can regulate itself
尽管做出了认真的努力，但科技界并没有令人信服地证明它可以自我调整

`To be sure`, while we are competing with the Chinese, we should also work with them. There are many areas where cooperation can help everyone — for example in A.I.-based approaches to `climate challenges, space exploration, disaster relief and pandemics.`
当然，我们在与中国人竞争的同时，也应该与他们合作。在许多领域，合作可以帮助所有人——例如使用人工智能，在应对气候挑战、太空探索、救灾和流行病等方面采取措施

`These recommendations are informed by` recent experiences in industry and public service, but they are `inspired by the conviction instilled` when I was a much younger man that a wise federal strategy can `spur innovation`, drive private enterprise and `renew American leadership.`
这些建议是根据我最近在产业和公共服务方面的经验提出的，但它们的灵感，来自年少之时潜移默化而成的信念：明智的联邦战略可以刺激创新、推动私营企业和重振美国的领导地位

Ultimately, the Chinese are competing to become the world’s leading innovators, and the United States `is not playing to win`. A `bold, bipartisan initiative` can `extend our country’s technology advantage` beyond what many experts predict. `Success matters` for more than our companies’ bottom lines and our military’s `battlefield edge`
最终，中国正在竞争成为世界领先的创新者，而美国这样下去是不会获胜的。一个大胆的、跨党派的倡议给我国的技术优势带来的大幅提振，将是许多专家不曾预见的。成败不只是关系到企业的盈亏和军队在战场上的优势

A group of experts I belong to (the R&D Blueprint) `coined the term` “Disease X”: We `were referring to the next pandemic`, which would be caused by an unknown, `novel pathogen that hadn’t yet entered the human population`
我所在的专家组R&D Blueprint创造了“疾病X”这个词，它指的是下一次大范围流行病，届时会由一种未知、新奇、人类从未接触过的病原体引发

As the world `stands today on the edge of the pandemic precipice`, it’s worth taking a moment to consider whether Covid-19 is the disease our group was warning about
今天，世界正站在大范围流行病的悬崖边缘，我们有必要花点时间来考虑一下，Covid-19是否就是我们小组所警告的那种疾病

Disease X would have `a mortality rate` higher than a seasonal flu but would `spread as easily as the flu`. It would `shake financial markets` even before it `achieved pandemic status`. `In a nutshell`, Covid-19 is Disease X.
疾病X的死亡率高于季节性流感，但传播起来和流感一样容易。甚至在大流行之前就能撼动金融市场. 简而言之，Covid-19就是疾病

`The looming pandemic` will challenge us in new ways, as people try to `evade quarantines`, and misinformation campaigns and conspiracy theorists `ply their trade` in open democracies.
随着人们试图逃避检疫，散布不实信息，阴谋论者在开放的民主国家开展活动，迫在眉睫的大流行将以新的方式挑战我们

But as the world struggles to respond to Covid-19, we `risk missing the really big picture`: Pandemics are `on the rise`, and we need to `contain the process` that drives them, not just the individual diseases
但是，当全世界都在努力应对Covid-19的时候，我们却有可能忽视了真正的大方向：大规模流行病的势头正在上升，我们需要遏制推动它们的进程，而不是仅仅关注个别疾病

These `spillovers` are `increasing exponentially` as our `ecological footprint` brings us closer to wildlife in remote areas and the wildlife trade brings these animals into urban centers. 
随着我们的生态足迹使我们更接近偏远地区的野生动物，以及野生动物贸易使这些动物进入城市中心，这些后果正呈指数级增长

`Unprecedented road-building, deforestation, land clearing` and agricultural development, as well as globalized travel and trade, make us `supremely susceptible` to pathogens like coronaviruses
随着我们的生态足迹使我们更接近偏远地区的野生动物，以及野生动物贸易使这些动物进入城市中心，这些后果正呈指数级增长

Yet the world’s strategy for dealing with pandemics is `woefully inadequate`. `Across the board, from politicians to the public`, we treat pandemics as a disaster-response issue: We wait for them to happen and hope a vaccine or drug can be developed quickly `in their aftermath`
然而，世界应对大范围流行病的策略严重不足。从政治人物到公众，我们都把它当作灾难来应对：我们坐等它们发生，并希望发生后能够迅速研制出疫苗或药物

The problem is that between outbreaks, `the will to spend money on prevention wanes`, and the market for vaccines and drugs against `sporadic viral diseases` isn’t enough to drive research and development
问题是，在两次疫情暴发间隙，投入资金预防的意愿减弱，针对零星病毒性疾病的疫苗和药物市场不足以推动研究和开发

As Covid-19 strikes today and `a spate of` other pathogens are ready to emerge in the future, we continue to `butt up against nature`
随着今天的Covid-19暴发和未来其他大量病原体的出现，我们还在继续与自然作斗争

Scaling up this effort to `cover all viral families`, as the Global Virome Project proposes to do, is `a logical first step` toward prevention
按照Global Virome项目的建议，将这一努力扩大到所有病毒家族，这是迈向预防的合理第一步

China is known as the world’s factory for `car parts`, toys and electronics, but it also `churns out` much of the `penicillin, antibiotics and pain medicines` used across the globe, as well as `surgical masks` and medical devices
中国以汽车零部件、玩具和电子产品的世界工厂而闻名，但它也生产了全世界所使用的大部分青霉素、抗生素和止痛药，以及医用口罩和医疗设备

`While the United States remains a global leader in drug discovery`, much of the manufacturing has `moved offshore`. The last American plant to `make key ingredients for penicillin` announced it would close its doors in 2004
美国仍然是全球领先的药物研发国，但其大部分药物生产已经转移到海外。美国最后一家生产青霉素关键成分的工厂已在2004年宣布关闭

If China shut the door on exports of core components to make our medicines, within months our `pharmacy shelves would become bare` and our health care system would `cease to function`
假如中国停止出口我国药品生产的核心成分，几个月之内，我们的药店货架就会空空如也，我们的医疗系统就会停止运作

If China `banned the export of drugs`, the United States would `sink into the hell` of a novel coronavirus epidemic
如果中国禁止药品出口，美国将会陷入新冠肺炎疫情的地狱

And South Korea, Germany, India, Taiwan and others `have clamped down on exports` of masks and other `protective gear` over worries their own supplies will `fall short`
韩国、德国、印度、台湾及其他国家政府都因为担心供应不足而限制了口罩和其他防护装备的出口

He called the administration’s coming `executive order` “a very strong first step in `incentivizing domestic production`.”
政府即将发布的行政命令是“刺激国内生产强有力的第一步”。

Technically I think it’s possible, but `unlikely from a cost effectiveness perspective`. The Trump administration has urged companies making electronics, steel, toys and many other products to move their supply chains out of China, `with mixed success`.
从技术上讲，我认为是可能的，但从成本效益的角度看，可能性不大。特朗普政府呼吁制造电子产品、钢铁、玩具和许多其他产品的企业将供应链移出中国，但收效上喜忧参半

China is also a key producer of the chemicals that go into making drugs, and `home to a vast supply` of `well-educated but low-paid scientists`. And `pharmaceutical companies` say they `are drawn to` China as a large and rapidly growing health care market `in its own right`
中国也是用于制药的化学物质的主要生产国，并拥有大批受过良好教育但收入较低的科学家。制药公司说，它们被吸引到中国，因其本身就是一个庞大且快速增长的医疗保健市场

In the private sector, as in many other industries, pharmaceutical companies `have shifted from stockpiling goods in warehouses` to a `“just in time” logistics model` that ships products as `need arises` — reducing costs but also increasing the `likelihood of shortages`
与许多其他行业一样，私营部门中的制药公司已经从在仓库中储存货物转变为在需求增加时运输产品的“刚刚好”物流模式——这降低了成本，但也增加了短缺的可能性

‘It’s Just Everywhere Already’: How Delays in Testing `Set Back` the U.S. Coronavirus Response
“它已经无处不在”：美国如何错失了遏制新冠病毒的良机

`As luck would have it`, Dr. Chu had a way to monitor the region. For months, as part of a research project into the flu, she and a team of researchers had been `collecting nasal swabs` from residents experiencing symptoms throughout the Puget Sound region.
凑巧的是，海伦·朱有办法监测该地区。几个月来，作为针对流感的研究项目的一部分，她和一组研究人员一直在整个普吉特海湾地区出现症状的居民中收集鼻拭子

 Local officials across the country were left to `work blindly` as the crisis `grew undetected and exponentially`
 危机在不知不觉中急剧恶化，全国各地的地方官员却只能盲目应对

 It’s going to `take rigorous, aggressive public health` — `what I like to say, block and tackle`, That means if you find a new case, you isolate it
这将需要严格、积极主动的公众卫生——我想说的是，阻断并处理，这意味着如果你发现了一个新病例，要进行隔离

But the Seattle Flu Study illustrates `how existing regulations and red tape` — sometimes designed to protect privacy and health — have `impeded the rapid rollout` of testing nationally, while other countries ramped up much earlier and faster
但是从西雅图的流感研究可见，现行的监管和繁琐程序——有时旨在保护隐私和健康——如何导致无法快速进行全国范围的测试，而其他国家却可以更早、更迅速地进行

Faced with a public health emergency `on a scale potentially not seen in a century`, the United States has not `responded nimbly`
面对可能是百年一遇的公共卫生突发事件，美国未能做出灵活反应

The C.D.C.’s `own effort to` create a system for monitoring the virus around the country, using `established government surveillance networks` for the flu, has not yet `built steam`
疾控中心自己的努力，即利用现成的政府流感监控网络建立全国范围内的病毒监控系统，目前尚未运转起来

The C.D.C.’s first job was to `develop a diagnostic test`. “That’s our `prime mission`,” Dr. Redfield said, “to `get eyes on this thing`.”
疾控中心的第一项工作就是开发诊断测试。“我们的首要任务，”雷德菲尔德说，“就是能看到这东西”

Dr. Chu `tried repeatedly to wrangle approval` to use the Seattle Flu Study. The answers `were always no`
朱医生曾多次试图争取批准使用西雅图流感研究。得到的回答始终是否定的

By Feb. 24, as new cases of the virus began `popping up` in the United States, the state labs were `growing frantic`.
到2月24日，随着新的病例开始在美国出现，州实验室一片混.

The Association of Public Health Laboratories made what it called an “`extraordinary and rare request`” of Dr. Stephen Hahn, `the commissioner` of the F.D.A., asking him to `use his discretion` to allow state and local public health laboratories to create their own tests for the virus
美国公共卫生实验室协会向FDA局长斯蒂芬·哈恩博士提出了一个“非同寻常而罕见的要求”，要求他使用自由裁量权，允许州和地方公共卫生实验室自行进行病毒检测

But the approval process for laboratory-developed tests `was proving onerous`
但事实证明，实验室进行检测的审批过程十分繁琐

Still, the troubling finding `reshaped how officials understood the outbreak`. Seattle Flu Study scientists `quickly sequenced the genome` of the virus, finding `a genetic variation` also present in the country’s first coronavirus case
尽管如此，这一令人不安的发现改变了官员们对疫情的理解。西雅图流感研究所的科学家迅速对病毒的基因组进行了测序，发现在美国首例冠状病毒病例中也存在遗传变异

`The implications were unnerving`. There was a good chance that the virus had been `circulating silently in the community` for around six weeks, infecting potentially hundreds of people.
其含义令人不安。该病毒很有可能已经在社区内悄无声息地传播了大约六周，感染了数百人

They would need to use `a new consent form` that explicitly mentioned that results of the coronavirus tests might be shared with the local health department
他们将需要使用一份新的同意书，明确提到冠状病毒检测的结果可能会与当地卫生部门共享

The availability of testing for coronavirus `remains uneven`
冠状病毒检测仍然不是哪里都可以做

`The frustration`, she said, was how long it took to `cut through red tape` to try to save lives in an outbreak that had the potential to explode in Washington State and spread in many other regions
她说，令人沮丧的是，在一场可能在华盛顿州暴发，并在许多其他地区蔓延的疫情中，人们花了许多时间才得以突破繁文缛节去挽救生命

I’m writing this from `the makeshift quarantine bunker` in my dining room — `sweatpants on, hand sanitizer nearby`, `snacking my way through` my `emergency rations`.
这些是我在我家饭厅临时改造的隔离区写下的——穿着运动裤，洗手消毒液就在手边，时不时地吃两口我的紧急口粮配给，也就是零食

In his blog post last week, he wrote that it “might also offer an opportunity for many companies to finally build a culture that allows `long-overdue work flexibility`.”
他上周在博客中写道：“它还可能为许多公司提供机会，最终建立一种备受期待的灵活工作文化。”

I was a work-from-home evangelist who told everyone `within earshot` about the benefits of avoiding the office. `No commute! No distracting co-workers`! Home-cooked lunch! What’s not to love?
我狂热鼓吹在家工作，告诉身边的每个人避开办公室的好处。不用通勤！没有同事来打扰你！在家吃饭！让人怎能不爱？

Most people should work in an office, or near other people, and `avoid solitary work-from-home arrangements whenever possible.`
大多数人应该在办公室或在其他人周围工作，并尽量避免独自在家工作的安排

But for those of us `lucky enough to be able to` work from home, coronavirus or no, `a few words of caution are in order.`
但是对于我们这些能在家工作的幸运儿，无论有没有冠状病毒，有必要注意以下几点

`The study examined` remote workers at a Chinese travel agency and found that they `were 13 percent more efficient than` their office-based peers
该研究对中国一家在线旅行服务公司的远程工作人员进行了调查，发现他们的效率比办公室同事高13％

But research also shows that what remote workers `gain in productivity`, they often miss in `harder-to-measure benefits` like creativity and innovative thinking. `Team cohesion` suffers in remote work arrangements
但是研究也表明，虽然远程工作者效率更高，但他们也错失了创造力和创新思维这些难以衡量的收益. 远程工作会影响团队凝聚力

Steve Jobs, `for one`, was a famous opponent of remote work, believing that Apple employees’ best work `came from accidentally bumping into other people`, not sitting at home in front of an email inbox.
史蒂夫·乔布斯就是著名的远程工作反对者，他认为苹果员工最好的工作表现来自于偶然的碰撞，而不是坐在家里面对收件箱

Creativity comes from `spontaneous meetings`, from random discussions, You `run into someone`, you ask what they’re doing, you say ‘Wow,’ and soon you’re `cooking up all sorts of ideas`.
创造力源于自发的会议，来自随机的讨论，你遇到一个人，问问他在做什么，听了就说‘哇’，然后很快就有各种各样的点子冒出来

`I’ll grant that office work has its downsides`, even in healthy times. Commuting has been shown to make us less happy, and `the open-plan office`, `a truly cursed workplace design trend` that emphasizes `airy spaces` with `rows of desks and little privacy`, has made `distraction-free focus nearly impossible`
我承认，即使是在健康的时期，在办公室工作也有它的缺点。事实证明，通勤会让我们不那么开心，开放式办公室真是一种令人讨厌的办公室设计趋势，它强调通风的空间，带有一排排的办公桌，几乎没有隐私，让人几乎不可能不受干扰地专心工作

But some people may never `be content with virtual water coolers.`
但有些人可能永远不会满足于虚拟的饮水机

As `a white-collar millennial`, I’m supposed to `be cheering on` the remote work revolution. But I’ve realized that `I can’t be my best, most human self in sweatpants`, pretending to pay attention on video conferences `between trips to the fridge`
作为一名千禧一代的白领，我应该为远程工作革命欢呼。但我已经意识到，穿着运动裤，假装专心参加视频会议，时不时去冰箱拿东西，这并不是我最好、最有人情味的状态

As supply chains in the West `began to run dry`, `airfreight rates from China jumped` suddenly last week
随着西方国家的供应链开始枯竭，上周来自中国的空运价格迅速上涨

Beijing `has unleashed a series of top-down measures` to get offices and factories `humming again`
为了让办公室和工厂重新活跃起来，中国政府出台了一系列自上而下的措施

The state-owned railway `has halved a wide range of freight charges`. The national education ministry has `created 180,000 spaces at graduate schools` next autumn for students graduating this spring `with little prospect of a job`

Those measures `face formidable hurdles`. Local officials are under pressure to reduce new infections, making them nervous about allowing people to return to work.
恢复经济活动的措施面临着巨大障碍。地方官员在减少新感染病例上面临巨大压力，这让他们对允许工人重返工作岗位十分紧张

`Cash-strapped families` may also `be reluctant to spend`. Household and corporate debts are huge after a decade of `heavy lending by the state-controlled banking sector`. Workers do not know whether their employers can pay them. Businesses do not know if other businesses `will default on payments` for goods and services
现金拮据的家庭可能也不愿意花钱。在国家控制的银行部门大量发放贷款十年之后，家庭和企业都担负着巨额的债务。工人们不知道他们的雇主是否发得出工资。企业不知道其他企业是否会拖欠商品和服务的付款

The provincial authorities in southern China `stepped in` a week ago to rescue HNA Group, `a debt-laden private sector conglomerate` that has struggled to pay its bills.
一周前，中国南方一个省的政府出手救助海航集团，这家负债累累的私营企业集团陷入债务危机

More than 50 million migrant workers have not yet returned to their jobs, according to official data. Some `remain in quarantine`. Others are `stranded in rural areas` where bus service has not resumed
官方数据显示，逾5000万农民工尚未返回工作岗位。有些人仍在隔离中。有些人被困在农村地区，因为那里的长途汽车还没有恢复运行

`Signs of fraud` have already emerged, making it harder for officials in Beijing to figure out what is going on around the country. `One scam `involves businesses that `turn on air conditioning and run machinery with no output`, said Cao Heping, a Peking University economist. The goal is to `burn enough electricity to qualify for restart subsidies`
欺诈的迹象已经出现，这让北京的官员们更难弄清楚全国的情况。北京大学经济学家曹和平说，一种骗局是，企业打开空调，让机器运转起来，却没有产出。这样做的目的是耗掉足够多的电力，以达到领取复工补贴的资格

Until China `revs up fully`, many people are trying to `conserve cash`
在中国恢复全速发展之前，许多人都在努力节省现金

On a nearby street, Dai Jianglai fears `the imminent failure` of her `grilled pancake eatery`
在附近的一条街上，戴姜莱担心自己的锅盔店很快就要倒闭

`With business so weak`, Mr. Zhang sits every day among his `piles of unsold windshields` and regrets returning a month ago from his hometown, several hours’ drive from Shanghai. “`If I had known it would come to this`," he said, “`I would have stayed home`.”
生意这么不景气，张先生每天都坐在一堆卖不出去的挡风玻璃中间，后悔一个月前从距离上海几个小时车程的老家回到上海，他的老家。“早知道是这个情况，”他说，“我就不回来了。”

Her `lectures` were being replaced by online classes. Her `residence hall was being cleared out`. She, `like thousands of others in her shoes`, had a million questions
她的课换成了在线教学。她的宿舍要腾空。现在，她和其他几万名面临同样处境的学生一样，脑中有无数疑问

One after the other, `like dominoes`, they announced they were suspending classes and asking students to `pack up and go`
于是，如多米诺骨牌一般，他们一个接一个地宣布停课，并让学生打包离开

Dance, theater and music students `fretted that after months of rehearsals` there would be no performances. `Seniors were already mourning their commencement`, assuming that it, too, would be canceled, and that `the Class of 2020 might be together for the last time`
让舞蹈、戏剧和音乐专业的学生苦恼的是，他们排练了好几个月，但演出可能要没了。大四学生已经开始哀叹：他们猜测毕业典礼也要被取消了，2020届可能要就此各奔东西

Some `altruistically minded students` worried about going home and `perhaps unwittingly infecting` their older and more vulnerable parents and grandparents `should the virus already be present at their schools`
有一些为他人着想的学生担心，如果学校已经发现病毒，回家会无意中感染更易感的父母和祖父母等长辈

Ms. Lockhart-Calpito, 19, is `on full financial aid`, which includes tuition, room and board. Her parents are `self-employed`, and she `had scraped together airfare home` for spring break by working two part-time jobs, `as a tutor and as an usher and ticket seller`
19岁的洛哈特-卡皮托领着全额助学金，包括学费、住宿费和餐费。她父母是个体经营者，她自己勉强凑够了春假回家的机票，为此她要打两份零工，一份是家教，一份是领位兼售票员

`Now though`, she has found that the university so welcoming to students like her `had not thought through the consequences of its decisions` about the virus for `those without means`. It felt, she said, “`like an eviction notice.`”
然而现在，她发觉如此欢迎像她这样的学生的学校，在就疫情做决策时，没有考虑这会给没有资源的学生带来什么样的后果。她说，感觉就像是“收到了一张驱逐令”

She `had originally planned to fly home` for spring break on Thursday but had to cancel her flight, `forfeiting its $250 value`, when she got the notification on Tuesday morning
她原计划周四搭飞机回家过春假，但周二收到通知后，不得不取消机票，并因此损失250美元

“We’re `living off her tips`,” she said of her family. “It was a difficult decision, but honestly we `weren’t really left with a choice`.”
“我们靠妈妈的小费过日子，”她谈到家庭情况时说，“这是个艰难的决定，但说实话我们没有选择的余地。”

Harvard officials said they `were swamped with requests` for financial and logistical help and could not take time to talk in detail about the situation
哈佛校方表示，他们现在被资金和后勤方面的协助要求淹没，没有时间深入谈论具体情况

A friend sent him a video of a lecture in which the professor `was wearing purple surgical gloves` and `spraying down the table with a bottle of bleach`
朋友发给他一个讲座的视频，教授戴着紫色的外科手套，拿着一瓶消毒液在喷桌子

He is not looking forward to online classes `because of his previous experience with virtual physics and calculus courses`. They were easier than `live classes`, he said, and as a result, `he did not learn as much`
由于之前的物理和微积分网课体验不佳，他对在线上课没什么期待。网课要比面授简单，他说，因此他在网课中学到的不如面授多

Juan Diego Jaramillo, a senior at Columbia, `was bracing for his long-awaited commencement` to be canceled because of the danger that the virus would spread through `the assembled families`. “`We’d rather they just pull the Band-Aid off`” and deliver the bad news now, he said
哥伦比亚大学的大四学生胡安·迭戈·哈拉米约正在为取消毕业典礼做准备，他一直在等待这一消息，因为典礼上家庭聚集，有传播病毒的危险。“我们宁愿他们直接把创可贴撕了，”现在就宣布坏消息，他说

Most of what it makes are `the disposable surgical masks` worn by health professionals. It makes `a smaller number of N95 respirator masks`, which provide `more filtration` for doctors and nurses.
它生产的大部分产品是卫生专业人员戴的一次性外科口罩，为医护人员提供更多过滤能力的N95呼吸器口罩产量较小

The bans “`risk undermining our collective approach` to handle this crisis,”
这些禁令“有可能破坏我们在这场危机中的共同应对”

Supplies from `a five-story building` in southwestern Shanghai could `help alleviate the shortage`
来自上海西南一座五层大楼的供应，可能有助于缓解短缺

Standing at the factory fence, which `was topped with six strands of electrified wire`, a worker who gave only his family name, Zhou, said the masks had been helping China fight the virus
一位只愿透露自己姓周的工人站在工厂外的电网栅栏前说，口罩一直在帮助中国抗击病毒
