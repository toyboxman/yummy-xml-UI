The Defense Department should `capitalize on that resource surge to build breakthrough capabilities` in A.I., quantum, hypersonics and other `priority technology areas`
国防部应将这些资源投资到人工智能、量子物理、超音速技术和其他高优先级技术上，以创造领域水平上的突破

For example, a partnership should `expand affordable access` to cloud computing for university researchers and students. A new proposal from Stanford for a “National Research Cloud” `offers a vision` for this.
例如，应该建立一种合作伙伴关系，让大学研究人员和学生可以用上廉价的云计算。斯坦福大学的新提议“国家研究云”为该目标提供了一个思路

We can change the immigration process for `highly skilled people` now to `reduce the red tape, backlogs and uncertainty` that threaten to drive tech talent to other countries ― including to our strategic competitors.
我们现在就可以改变高技能人才的移民程序，以减少官僚主义、积压和不确定性，这些都有可能将科技人才推向其他国家――包括我们的战略竞争对手

We should `accelerate discovery by creating more flexible ways` to fund `the most promising researchers` for multiple years at a time. This `opens longer-term paths` to scientific discovery
我们应该通过创造更灵活的方式来加速新发现，为最有前途的研究人员提供多年资助。这会为科学发现开辟更长远的道路

`Despite earnest efforts`, the tech community has not `demonstrated convincingly` that it can regulate itself
尽管做出了认真的努力，但科技界并没有令人信服地证明它可以自我调整

`To be sure`, while we are competing with the Chinese, we should also work with them. There are many areas where cooperation can help everyone ― for example in A.I.-based approaches to `climate challenges, space exploration, disaster relief and pandemics.`
当然，我们在与中国人竞争的同时，也应该与他们合作。在许多领域，合作可以帮助所有人――例如使用人工智能，在应对气候挑战、太空探索、救灾和流行病等方面采取措施

`These recommendations are informed by` recent experiences in industry and public service, but they are `inspired by the conviction instilled` when I was a much younger man that a wise federal strategy can `spur innovation`, drive private enterprise and `renew American leadership.`
这些建议是根据我最近在产业和公共服务方面的经验提出的，但它们的灵感，来自年少之时潜移默化而成的信念：明智的联邦战略可以刺激创新、推动私营企业和重振美国的领导地位

Ultimately, the Chinese are competing to become the world’s leading innovators, and the United States `is not playing to win`. A `bold, bipartisan initiative` can `extend our country’s technology advantage` beyond what many experts predict. `Success matters` for more than our companies’ bottom lines and our military’s `battlefield edge`
最终，中国正在竞争成为世界领先的创新者，而美国这样下去是不会获胜的。一个大胆的、跨党派的倡议给我国的技术优势带来的大幅提振，将是许多专家不曾预见的。成败不只是关系到企业的盈亏和军队在战场上的优势

A group of experts I belong to (the R&D Blueprint) `coined the term` “Disease X”: We `were referring to the next pandemic`, which would be caused by an unknown, `novel pathogen that hadn’t yet entered the human population`
我所在的专家组R&D Blueprint创造了“疾病X”这个词，它指的是下一次大范围流行病，届时会由一种未知、新奇、人类从未接触过的病原体引发

As the world `stands today on the edge of the pandemic precipice`, it’s worth taking a moment to consider whether Covid-19 is the disease our group was warning about
今天，世界正站在大范围流行病的悬崖边缘，我们有必要花点时间来考虑一下，Covid-19是否就是我们小组所警告的那种疾病

Disease X would have `a mortality rate` higher than a seasonal flu but would `spread as easily as the flu`. It would `shake financial markets` even before it `achieved pandemic status`. `In a nutshell`, Covid-19 is Disease X.
疾病X的死亡率高于季节性流感，但传播起来和流感一样容易。甚至在大流行之前就能撼动金融市场. 简而言之，Covid-19就是疾病

`The looming pandemic` will challenge us in new ways, as people try to `evade quarantines`, and misinformation campaigns and conspiracy theorists `ply their trade` in open democracies.
随着人们试图逃避检疫，散布不实信息，阴谋论者在开放的民主国家开展活动，迫在眉睫的大流行将以新的方式挑战我们

But as the world struggles to respond to Covid-19, we `risk missing the really big picture`: Pandemics are `on the rise`, and we need to `contain the process` that drives them, not just the individual diseases
但是，当全世界都在努力应对Covid-19的时候，我们却有可能忽视了真正的大方向：大规模流行病的势头正在上升，我们需要遏制推动它们的进程，而不是仅仅关注个别疾病

These `spillovers` are `increasing exponentially` as our `ecological footprint` brings us closer to wildlife in remote areas and the wildlife trade brings these animals into urban centers. 
随着我们的生态足迹使我们更接近偏远地区的野生动物，以及野生动物贸易使这些动物进入城市中心，这些后果正呈指数级增长

`Unprecedented road-building, deforestation, land clearing` and agricultural development, as well as globalized travel and trade, make us `supremely susceptible` to pathogens like coronaviruses
随着我们的生态足迹使我们更接近偏远地区的野生动物，以及野生动物贸易使这些动物进入城市中心，这些后果正呈指数级增长

Yet the world’s strategy for dealing with pandemics is `woefully inadequate`. `Across the board, from politicians to the public`, we treat pandemics as a disaster-response issue: We wait for them to happen and hope a vaccine or drug can be developed quickly `in their aftermath`
然而，世界应对大范围流行病的策略严重不足。从政治人物到公众，我们都把它当作灾难来应对：我们坐等它们发生，并希望发生后能够迅速研制出疫苗或药物

The problem is that between outbreaks, `the will to spend money on prevention wanes`, and the market for vaccines and drugs against `sporadic viral diseases` isn’t enough to drive research and development
问题是，在两次疫情暴发间隙，投入资金预防的意愿减弱，针对零星病毒性疾病的疫苗和药物市场不足以推动研究和开发

As Covid-19 strikes today and `a spate of` other pathogens are ready to emerge in the future, we continue to `butt up against nature`
随着今天的Covid-19暴发和未来其他大量病原体的出现，我们还在继续与自然作斗争

Scaling up this effort to `cover all viral families`, as the Global Virome Project proposes to do, is `a logical first step` toward prevention
按照Global Virome项目的建议，将这一努力扩大到所有病毒家族，这是迈向预防的合理第一步
