`Any way you cut it`, this is going to be bad, `the projected size` of the outbreak already seems hard to believe
不管你们怎么看，情况都会变得很糟糕，预期的疫情规模看起来已经让人难以置信

Dr. Mecher was urging `the upper ranks` of the nation’s public health bureaucracy to wake up and prepare for the possibility of `far more drastic action`
梅彻在邮件中敦促美国公共卫生部门的高层清醒过来，为采取更激烈应对措施的可能性做好准备

He `seemed shellshocked and deflated` to some of his closest associates. One described him as `“subdued” and “baffled”` by how the crisis had played out
一些最亲密的助手发现他备受打击，灰心丧气。有人说他对危机愈演愈烈感到“郁闷”和“困惑”

He only `regained his swagger`, the associate said, from `conducting his daily White House briefings`, at which he often seeks to rewrite the history of the past several months
那名助手说，他只能靠每天的白宫新闻发布会来重拾自信，发布会上，他经常试图改写过去几个月的历史

And they insist that the president was either not `getting proper information`, or the people around him weren’t `conveying the urgency of the threat`. In some cases, they argue, the specific officials he was hearing from had been `discredited in his eyes`, but once the right information got to him through other channels, he `made the right calls`
他们坚持认为，要么是总统没得到正确的信息，要么是他周围的人没有传达威胁的紧迫性。他们辩称，在某些情况下，某些给他意见的官员在他看来是不足信的，但一旦通过其他渠道获得了正确的信息，他就会做出正确的决定

President Trump `took bold action` to protect Americans and `unleash the full power` of the federal government to `curb the spread of the virus,` expand testing capacities and `expedite vaccine development` even when we had no true idea the level of transmission or `asymptomatic spread`
特朗普总统采取了大胆的行动来保护美国民众，发动了联邦政府的全部力量来遏制病毒的传播，加大了检测能力，加快了疫苗研发，即便当时我们对感染或无症状传播的水平没有充分认知

There had already been `an alarming spike` in new cases around the world and the virus was spreading across the Middle East. It was becoming apparent that the administration `had botched the rollout` of testing to track the virus at home, and a smaller-scale surveillance program `intended to piggyback` on a federal flu tracking system had also been `stillborn`
世界各地的新病例出现了令人担忧的激增，病毒正在整个中东地区蔓延。越来越明显的是，政府搞砸了用来追踪国内传播的病毒检测，而一个借助联邦流感追踪系统的小型监控项目也胎死腹中

`Facing the likelihood` of a real pandemic, the group needed to decide when to `abandon “containment”` — the effort to keep the virus outside the U.S. and to isolate anyone who gets infected — and `embrace “mitigation” to thwart the spread` of the virus inside the country until a vaccine becomes available
面对真出现一场大流行的可能，工作组需要决定何时放弃“遏制”——即努力将病毒控制在美国之外，并隔离任何被感染的人——转而采取“缓解”措施，阻止病毒在国内的传播，直到有疫苗可用

A 20-year-old Chinese woman had `infected five relatives` with the virus even though she never `displayed any symptoms herself`. The `implication was grave` — apparently healthy people could be `unknowingly spreading the virus` — and supported the need to move quickly to mitigation
一名20岁的中国女子感染了五名亲属，尽管她本人从未表现出任何症状。这件事的可能影响很严重——表面上健康的人可能在无意中传播病毒——也为迅速采取措施减少传播的需要提供了依据

But over the next several days, a presidential `blowup and internal turf fights` would `sidetrack such a move`
但在接下来的几天里，总统的大发脾气和内部的地盘之争耽搁了这项计划

These final days of February, perhaps more than any other moment `during his tenure` in the White House, `illustrated Trump’s inability or unwillingness to absorb warnings` coming at him. 
2月份的最后几天，或许比特朗普入主白宫后的任何时刻都更能说明这位总统的无能或不愿意接受向他发出的警告

He instead `reverted to his traditional political playbook` in the midst of a `public health calamity`, `squandering vital time` as the coronavirus spread silently across the country
在一场公共卫生灾难中，他却重拾自己惯用的政治策略，浪费了宝贵的时间，让新冠病毒得以在全国悄悄地蔓延

Within 24 hours, before they got a chance to make their presentation to the president, `the plan went awry`
但在他们有机会向总统当面提交这份备忘录前不到24小时内，计划黄了

But Messonnier had `jumped the gun`. They had not told the president yet, `much less gotten his consent`.
但梅索尼耶早了一步。工作组还没有把计划告诉总统，更不用说得到他的同意了

On the 18-hour plane ride home, Trump `fumed as he watched the stock market crash` after Messonnier’s comments. `Furious`, he called Azar when he landed at around 6 a.m. on Feb. 26, `raging that` Messonnier had scared people unnecessarily. 
在飞回美国的18个小时行程中，特朗普眼看着梅索尼耶的警告导致股市崩盘，这让他怒不可遏。飞机在2月26日早上6点左右降落后，特朗普就怒气冲冲地打电话给阿扎尔，对梅索尼耶不必要地让人们惊慌大发雷霆

`Already on thin ice with` the president over a variety of issues and having overseen the failure to quickly produce an effective and widely available test, Azar would soon find his authority reduced
由于阿扎尔已在几个问题上与总统的关系如履薄冰，而且在快速生产有效且可广泛使用的检测盒上监管不力，他很快就会发现自己的权力被削弱了

`The push to convince Trump` of the need for `more assertive action stalled`. With Pence and his staff in charge, the focus was clear: no more `alarmist messages`
说服特朗普有必要采取果断行动的努力受到拖延。让彭斯和他的工作人员负责这项工作，重点很明确：不要再发出危言耸听的信息

Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser and `a hawk on China`, `took a blunt warning away from the call` with the doctor, a longtime friend: `A ferocious, new outbreak` that `on the surface appeared similar to` the SARS epidemic of 2003 had emerged in China. It had spread far more quickly than the government was admitting to, and `it wouldn’t be long before` it reached other parts of the world
波廷格是国家安全事务副主任，也是对华鹰派人士，他在打给医生老友的电话中，得到了一个直言不讳的警告：中国出现了看起来与2003年的SARS相似的新疫情。它的传播速度比政府承认的快得多，而且用不了多少时间就会传播到世界其他地方

And they `ran into opposition` from Trump’s economic advisers, who worried a tough approach toward China could `scuttle a trade deal` that was a pillar of Trump’s reelection campaign
这些人也受到了特朗普的经济顾问的反对。他们担心，对中国采取强硬态度可能会破坏与中国达成的初步贸易协议，而这是特朗普连任竞选的支柱之一

Intelligence agencies did not `detect any alarm` inside the Chinese government that `analysts presumed` would `accompany the accidental leak` of a deadly virus from a government laboratory
情报机构没有在中国政府的内部交流中发现任何警报，分析人士认为，如果一种致命病毒从政府实验室意外泄漏的话，会伴随有这种警报

Faced with `the relentless march of a deadly pathogen`, the disagreements and a lack of long-term planning had `significant consequences`
面对这种致命病原体的持续打击，分歧和缺乏长期规划导致了严重后果

The efforts to `sort out policy behind closed doors` were contentious and sometimes only loosely organized.
暗中制定对策的过程充满了争吵，有时在组织上很随意。

That was the case when the National Security Council `convened a meeting` on short notice on the afternoon of Jan. 27. `The Situation Room` was standing room only, `packed with` top White House advisers, low-level staffers, Trump’s `social media guru` and several Cabinet secretaries.
美国国家安全委员会于1月27日下午匆匆召集的一场会议，就属于这种情况。白宫战情室里只能站立，挤满了白宫高级顾问、低级别幕僚、特朗普的社媒大师和多位内阁部长

That `sentiment was present throughout February`, as the president’s top aides reached for a consistent message but took few concrete steps to prepare for the possibility of a major public health crisis
整个2月份，这种心态一直存在，总统的高级助手们一直在传达一致的信息，但没有采取任何具体步骤来为可能发生的重大公共卫生危机做准备

As images of America’s overwhelmed hospital wards and `snaking jobless lines` have flickered across the world, people on the European side of the Atlantic are looking at the richest and most powerful nation in the world `with disbelief`
当美国人满为患的医院病房和蜿蜒的失业者队伍的影像在世界各地播放，大西洋另一边的欧洲民众正难以置信地注视着这个世界上最富有和最强大的国家

There is a special irony: Germany and South Korea, both products of `enlightened postwar` American leadership, have become `potent examples` of best practices in the coronavirus crisis
有一点格外讽刺：德国和韩国均为战后美国领导启迪下的产物，如今已经成为新冠病毒危机中采取最佳措施的表率

Not long ago, Ms. Merkel was considered `a spent force`, having announced that this would be her last term. Now her approval ratings are at 80 percent
默克尔不久前宣布这将是她的最后任期，被认为大势已去。而现在她的支持率是80％

There is `another wild card` in the short term, Mr. Mo?si pointed out. The United States has an election in November. That, and `the aftermath of the deepest economic crisis` since the 1930s, might also affect the course of history
莫伊西指出，短期内还有一个不确定因素。美国将在11月举行大选。这件事，加上自上世纪30年代以来最严重的经济危机的后果，可能也会影响历史的进程

Europe’s social democratic systems are not only more human, they leave us better prepared and `fit to deal with a crisis` like this than the more `brutal capitalistic system` in the United States
欧洲的社会民主制度不仅更人性化，还让我们比实行残酷资本主义制度的美国更有准备，更适合应对这样的危机

To a historian `it’s nothing new`, that’s what happens, It’s `a very familiar story` in world history that after `a certain amount of time a power declines`
对于历史学家来说，这并不是什么新鲜事，这是世界历史上经常发生的故事，一段时间后，一个大国会衰落

You `accumulate problems`, and because you’re such a strong player, you can `carry these dysfunctionalities for a long time` Until something happens and you can’t anymore
你积累了很多问题，因为你是一股强大的势力，因此能够在很长一段时间内容纳这些机能的失调，直到有什么事情发生，搞得你不能继续这样下去

President Trump arrives in the Oval Office these days `as late as noon`, when he is usually `in a sour mood` after his morning `marathon of television`
特朗普总统要到中午才会来到总统办公室。因为看了一上午的电视，来到办公室的时候他总是情绪不佳

The president `sees few allies` `no matter which channel he clicks`. He is angry even with Fox, `an old security blanket`, for not `portraying him as he would like to be seen`
不管总统调到哪个台，都看不到帮他说话的人。就连福克斯这个以往让他备感安慰的台现在也让人生气，因为他们对自己的描绘与他的期望不符

Even Republicans have criticized Mr. Trump’s briefings as `long-winded` and his rough handling of critics as `unproductive`
就连共和党也批评特朗普的发布会冗长、应对批评粗率且没有成效

The executive order — `watered down with loopholes` after `an uproar` from business groups — was aimed at `pleasing his political base`
这道行政命令（因商界团体一片哗然而保留多项例外）是为了取悦他的政治基本盘

Aides said the president’s `low point` was in mid-March
他的助手说，3月中旬是最糟的时刻
