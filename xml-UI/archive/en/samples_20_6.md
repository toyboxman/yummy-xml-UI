In Days of Discord, a President `Fans the Flames`
分裂动荡之际，总统仍在煽风点火

While other presidents seek to cool the situation `in tinderbox moments` like this, Mr. Trump `plays with matches`. He `roars into any melee` he finds
遇到这样危机一触即发的情况，其他总统都会努力给局势降温，特朗普却在玩火。他咆哮着冲进各种混战

The police `cordoned off several blocks` around the Executive Mansion as `a phalanx of camouflage-wearing` National Guard troops `marched across` nearby Lafayette Square
身着迷彩服的国民警卫队列队穿过附近的拉斐特广场，与此同时，警方封锁了总统官邸周围的几个街区

While he `hides behind` his fence afraid/alone, I stand w/ people peacefully `exercising their First Amendment Right`. There are no `vicious dogs & ominous weapons`. There is just a scared man. Afraid/alone …
他躲在围栏后面，惊恐万分/孤家寡人，而我则在支持人们和平地行使第一修正案权利. 没有凶残的狗和厉害的武器。只有一个吓坏了的人。惊恐万分/孤家寡人...

From the start of his ascension to power, Mr. Trump has `presented himself as someone` who `seeks conflict, not conciliation, a fighter, not a peacemaker.`
从掌权之初，特朗普就把自己塑造成一个寻求冲突而非和解的人，他是斗士，不是和事佬

The president seems `more out-of-touch and detached from the difficult reality` the country is living than ever before, At a moment when America `desperately needs healing`, the president is focused on petty personal battles with his `perceived adversaries`
总统似乎比以往任何时候都更脱离、更漠视这个国家正在经历的艰难现实, 在美国迫切需要疗愈的时刻，总统却一心一意同他眼中的对手进行琐碎的个人斗争

It is fair to say that 2020 has `turned out to be` a year that `has frayed the fabric of American society` with `an accumulation of anguish` that `has whipsawed` the country and its people
公平地说，事实证明，2020年是美国社会结构受损的一年，累积起来的痛苦对美国和美国人民造成了极大的伤害

I am `daily thinking about` why and `how a society unravels` and what we can do to stop the process, `The calamity` these days is about more than Trump. He is just the `malicious con man` who lives to `exploit our vulnerabilities`
我每天都在思考，一个社会为什么会分解，是怎么分解的，我们能做些什么来阻止这个过程，这些天的灾难不仅仅和特朗普有关。他只是一个恶毒的骗子，全靠利用我们的弱点为生

Come on, what is this, sixth grade? You don’t `put gasoline on the fire`. That’s not `calming anybody`. All he does is diminish himself
“省省吧，这是什么呀，六年级小学生吗？你不要火上浇油了。你这根本不是在安抚.他所做的只是削弱他自己
