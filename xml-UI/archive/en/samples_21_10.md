Xu Jiayin was China’s richest man, a symbol of the country’s economic rise who helped **transform poverty-stricken** villages into **urbanized metropolises** for the **fledgling** middle class. He **amassed the trappings** of the elite, with trips to Paris to taste rare French wines, a million-dollar **yacht**, private jets
中国曾经的首富许家印是该国经济崛起的象征，他帮助贫困的村庄转变为新兴中产阶级的城市化大都市。他过着精英的生活，去巴黎品尝稀有的法国葡萄酒，拥有价值百万美元的游艇、私人飞机

 Last week, the company, which has unpaid bills **totaling more than** $300 billion, missed a key payment to foreign investors. That sent the world into **a panic** over whether China was facing its own **so-called** Lehman moment
 上周，负债总计超过3000亿美元的该公司未能向外国投资者支付一笔重要款项。这让世界陷入恐慌，怀疑中国是否正面临着自己的雷曼时刻

 The company’s crisis is testing the **resolve** of Chinese leaders’ efforts to reform as they **chart a new course** for the country’s economy.
 恒大的危机正在考验中国领导人在为国家经济开辟新道路时进行改革的决心。

 The term ‘**paradigm shift**’ is always **overused**, so people **tend to ignore** it. But that’s a good way of describing what’s happening right now.
 ‘范式转变’这个词被用烂了，所以往往不为人们所重视。但这是对目前正在发生的事情最贴切的描述。

 Mr. Xu and his company have **mirrored** China’s own economic **ascent** from an **agrarian economy** to one that **embraced** capitalism.
 许家印和他的公司折射出中国从农业经济到拥抱资本主义的崛起。

 Mr. Xu grew Evergrande from a **small outfit** with fewer than a dozen employees into China’s most **prolific** developer through a **combination** of **rampant borrowing** and elite political **connections**. 
 许家印通过大肆借贷和精英政治关系的结合，将恒大从一家只有不到十几名员工的小公司发展成为中国最多产的开发商。

 The party flew to Europe **on a private jet**, with the men playing a popular Chinese card game called “**fight the landlord**.” 
 一行人乘坐私人飞机飞往欧洲，男人们玩一种叫做“斗地主”的纸牌游戏。

 To **supercharge** Evergrande’s growth, Mr. Xu often borrowed twice **on each piece of land** that he developed ― first from the bank and then from home buyers who were **sometimes willing to** pay 100 percent of the value of their future home before it was built.
 为了推动恒大发展，许家印经常拿他开发的项目贷款两次――先是向银行，然后向购房者，这些购房者有时愿意在房子建成前支付100%的房款。

 Xu Jiayin **represents a very important aspect** of China’s economic reform, He used **his wits and his daring** to very, very **aggressively** expand his business, **oftentimes dangerously** so, **from a financial accounting perspective**.
 许家印代表了中国经济改革的一个非常重要的方面，他运用自己的智慧和勇气，非常、非常积极地扩大了自己的业务，从财务会计的角度来看，有时是非常危险的。

**With access to** cheap money and **unbridled** ambition, Mr. Xu expanded into areas in which Evergrande had no experience or expertise, including bottled water, electric cars, **pig farming** and professional sports. His electric vehicle company had a **bold vision** to become bigger and more powerful than Tesla; so far it has delayed **mass production**.
凭借廉价的资金和不受限制的野心，许家印扩张到了恒大没有经验或专长的领域，包括瓶装水、电动汽车、养猪和职业体育。他的电动车公司有一个大胆的愿景，要成为比特斯拉更大、更强的公司；到目前为止，它已经推迟了量产。

If Beijing tries to **make an example out of** Evergrande by letting it collapse, the wealth of millions of people could **vanish along with** Mr. Xu’s empire.
如果北京试图杀鸡儆猴，让恒大破产，数百万人的财富可能会随着许家印的帝国一起消失。

**Amid concerns** that an Evergrande **demise** could **spread through** the Chinese economy, Beijing **unleashed a flood of capital into** China’s banking system last week, **a move** that was seen as **an attempt** to **calm market jitters**.
在人们担心恒大破产可能波及整个中国经济之际，北京上周向中国的银行体系注入了大量资金，此举被视为试图平息市场的不安情绪。

 When China’s economy began to **cool down**, the damage caused by Evergrande’s **voracious appetite** for debt became impossible to ignore. 
 当中国经济开始降温时，恒大贪婪的借债欲望造成的损害变得不可忽视。

 **Debt-saddled** corporate giants like Evergrande were given the freedom to open their **bloody mouths** and **devour the wealth** of our country and our people until they are **too big to fall**, China’s economy and society will be set on the **crater of the volcano** where all may be **ignited** any time.
 像恒大这样负债累累的企业巨头被赋予自由，任其张开血盆大口吞噬我们国家和国民的财富；直到其大到不能倒. 中国经济和社会就会被架上火山口，随着都可能被点燃。

 President Biden has been **working hard to make the pivot to** Asia that his two **predecessors** never **quite managed**.
 拜登总统一直努力转向亚洲，这是他的两位前任都未能完全做到的事。

 It risks **compromising** long-term **nonproliferation interests** in favor of **near-term** militarism. It directs **immense** resources to **ineffective** strategies. It reacts to China’s military **buildup** but does not provide a **credible deterrent** or **seriously alter** the regional military balance against Beijing.
 它有可能为了短期的穷兵黩武而损害长期的防核扩散利益。它将大量资源用于无效的战略。它对中国的军事建设做出反应，但没有提供可靠的威慑力，也没有实质改变针对北京的地区军事平衡。

 It is **far more** difficult for the United States and its allies to **project power** thousands of miles to Taiwan than it is for China to project power 100 miles across the **Taiwan Strait**. U.S. aircraft **simply cannot** fly enough **sorties** to overwhelm both China’s aircraft and its missile defense systems. The AUKUS agreement does not **change these facts**. And any **marginal gains** are likely to be too little, too late. 
 美国及其盟友向数千英里外的台湾投射力量，要比中国向台湾海峡对面160公里外投射力量困难得多。美国飞机根本无法飞行足够的架次来压倒中国的飞机和它的导弹防御系统。AUKUS协议不会改变这些事实。任何边际收益都可能太少、太迟。

 Neither AUKUS **submarines** nor U.S. **bombers** flying from northern Australia are likely to **tip the balance** if they **are dedicated to** the same **losing strategy**. 
 无论是AUKUS的潜艇，还是从澳大利亚北部起飞的美国轰炸机，如果服务于同样的失败战略，它们都不可能改变平衡。

 This is a **hallmark** of great power competition: Competitive initiatives like AUKUS provide visible ways to **counter or balance or complicate** China’s military activities but don’t necessarily help allies meet defined objectives. **More often**, competition becomes **an end in itself** ― an **open-ended imperative** that assumes everything an **opponent dislikes** must be good policy. Another **common feature** of competitive policies is that officials tend to **overlook** their costs.
 这就是大国竞争的特点：要对中国的军事活动进行反制或平衡或干扰，像AUKUS这样的竞争性倡议可以给出显见的途径，不过这不等于就能帮助盟友实现其中所明确的目标。更常见的可能是，竞争本身成了目的――这是一种无休止的要求，即假定只要是对手不喜欢的东西就肯定是好政策。竞争性政策的另一个常见特性是官员倾向于无视成本。

 **For one thing**, AUKUS carries significant diplomatic costs **at a time** when the United States is **in desperate need of** credibility with its allies. France views AUKUS as “a knife in the back”, That **perceived betrayal** could cause unnecessary **friction** in NATO 
 首先一点，此时此刻盟友的信任正是美国迫切需要的，而AUKUS包含了巨大的外交成本。法国认为AUKUS是“背后捅刀”，这被认为是一次背叛，可能在北约内部导致不必要的摩擦

The Biden administration should **take a breath and make certain** it does not reflect a **self-defeating, militarized** concept of great power that pushes other potential partners away in **bullheaded pursuit** of agreement on one issue. It should **institute** strong nonproliferation safeguards, repair damage to other **vital alliances** and ensure that the plan isn’t **throwing good money** after bad strategy.
拜登政府需要静下来想清楚，此举会不会显得像一种弄巧成拙的军事化大国概念，导致其他潜在合作者被这种对单一问题协议的固执追求吓跑。协议需要制定强有力的不扩散防护措施，修复它给其他重要盟友造成的伤害，确保这不是在把钱浪费在糟糕的战略上。

**Too often**, a **narrow focus** on great power competition just leaves America **less competitive** in the **long run**.
在大国竞争中，过分关注某一点经常导致美国丧失长远的竞争力。

China will **aim to reduce the prevalence** of “**medically unnecessary**” abortions, according to guidelines released by the central government on Monday, as part of **a sweeping plan** for women’s and children’s health over the next decade.
根据中央政府周一发布的指导意?，中国将致力于减少“非医学需要的”人工流产的盛行，这是未来十年妇女儿童健康全面计划的一部分。

But the promise immediately **drew attention** on social media **given increasingly urgent efforts** by the government in recent years to promote childbirth and **slow the population’s aging**. Under the one-child policy, which **was implemented** in 1980, officials **at times** forced women to **undergo abortions and sterilizations**.
但这一承诺立即在社交媒体上引起了关注，因为近年来政府在促进生育和减缓人口老龄化方面的努力日益紧迫。在1980年实施的独生子女政策下，官员有时会强迫女性堕胎和绝育。

But over the past decade, as the government has realized the **potential economic consequences** of a slow-growing population, officials have **pivoted to exhorting** women to have more children. The one-child policy **was lifted** in 2015. But public reaction to that permission **was tepid at best**. And some have worried that officials will **turn to more coercive measures**.
但在过去十年里，随着政府意识到人口增?缓慢的潜在经济后果，官员们转而鼓励女性多生孩子。独生子女政策于2015年取消。但公众对这一许可的反应充其量也只是不温不火。一些人担心官员们会采取更加强制的措施。

**Obtaining** an abortion can already be **a somewhat cumbersome process** in China. Because of many families’ **longstanding preference** for boys over girls, sex-selective abortions are illegal
在中国，人工流产已经是一个相当繁琐的过程。由于许多家庭?期以来重男轻女，针对胎儿性别的选择性人工流产是非法的

Officials have also expressed concern about abortions as **a manifestation of eroding family values**. **In addition to citing** potential health risks, the procedure could **lead to infertility** that would “**affect family harmony** and happiness.”
官员们还对人工流产表示担忧，认为这是家庭价值观受到侵蚀的表现。除了提到潜在的健康?险外，人工流产可能会导致不孕，“影响家庭和谐幸福”。

She pointed to other parts of the report that she **called encouraging**, such as **pledges to combat gender discrimination** in the workplace, improve educational opportunities for women and **promote sharing housework** between men and women.
她指出报告中其他令人鼓舞的部分，比如承诺打击工作场所的性别歧视，改善女性受教育的机会，以及促进男女分担家务。

Still, she acknowledged the **yawning gap** between official **rhetoric and reality**. State **media outlets** have recently attacked the **perceived “feminization”** of Chinese men. 
不过她承认，官方的言论与现实之间存在巨大差距。官方媒体最近抨击了人们眼中的中国男性被“女性化”的现象

Though the report **affirms the authorities’ stance** against sexual harassment, a judge this month **ruled against the plaintiff** in the most **high-profile** harassment case to **come out of** China’s Me Too movement.
尽管该报告确认了当局反对性骚扰的立场，但一位法官本月对来自中国Me Too运动最引人注目的性骚扰案件中的原告做出了不利判决。

Power cuts and even **blackouts have slowed or closed** factories across China in recent days, **adding a new threat to** the country’s slowing economy and potentially further **snarling global supply chains** ahead of the busy Christmas shopping season in the West. The **outages have rippled across** most of eastern China, where **the bulk of the population** lives and works. 
近日来，中国各地的限电甚至停电已导致工厂减产或停工，给中国正在放缓的经济增加了新的威胁，并可能在?方繁忙的圣诞节购物季到来之前进一步扰乱全球供应链。停电问题已波及中国东部大部分地区，中国的大部分人口在东部生活工作。

**Export demand for aluminum**, one of the most **energy-intensive products**, has been strong. Demand has also been **robust for steel and cement**, central to China’s **vast construction programs**.
铝是能耗强度最高的产品之一，出口需求一直强劲。处于中国各地大型建设项目核心的钢铁和水泥的需求也一直强劲。

As **electricity demand has risen**, it has also **pushed up the price of coal** to generate that electricity. But Chinese regulators have not **let utilities raise rates enough to cover** the rising cost of coal. 
电力需求的增加导致了发电所需的煤炭价格上涨。但中国监管部?不让公用事业公司通过提高电价来弥补煤炭成本的上涨。

Between the **rental costs and the diesel fuel** for powering it, electricity is now **twice as expensive as** when the factory was simply **tapping the grid**.
租金加上柴油成本，让工厂的电价高达电网供电的两倍。

Economists **predicted that production interruptions** at Chinese factories would make it harder for many stores in the West to **restock empty shelves** and could **contribute to inflation** in the coming months.
经济学家预计，中国工厂生产受供电吃紧的影响，将使?方国家许多货架已空的商店更难补货，并可能导致未来几个月的通货膨胀。

It is not clear how long **the power crunch will last**. Experts in China predicted that officials would **compensate by steering electricity away** from energy-intensive heavy industries like steel, cement and aluminum, and said that might **fix the problem**.
目前还不清楚电力短缺会持续多久。中国的专家预测，官员会采取补救措施，将电力从钢铁、水泥和铝等能耗强度高的重工业调拨给其他行业，并表示这可能会解决问题。

State Grid, the **government-run power distributor**, said in a statement on Monday that it would guarantee supplies “and **resolutely maintain the bottom line** of people’s **livelihoods**, development and safety.”
国家电网在周一的一份声明中表示将保障供电，“坚决守住?生、发展和安全底线。”

**Compared with last year**, electricity demand is growing this year in China at **nearly twice its usual annual pace. Swelling orders** for the smartphones, **appliances, exercise equipment** and other manufactured goods that China’s factories **churn out** has driven the rise.
与去年相比，中国今年的电力需求增?速度几乎是往年的两倍，原因是对中国生产的智能手机、家电、健身器材和其他制造业产品订单的激增。

Experts said that a surge in prices in China had drawn energy distributors to send **ships laden with liquefied natural gas** to Chinese ports, leaving others to **scurry for** further sources.
专家说，中国天然气价格的飙升，导致能源经销商将满载液化天然气的船只发往中国港口，让其他国家慌忙寻求其他的天然气来源。

Coal prices have **surged along with demand**. But because the government keeps electricity prices low, **particularly in residential areas**, usage by homes and businesses has **climbed regardless**.
煤炭价格随着电力需求的增?出现飙升。但由于政府将电价保持在低位，尤其是居?用电，使得家庭和企业的用电不受煤价的影响，继续上升。

**Faced with losing** more money with each additional ton of coal they burn, some power plants have **closed for maintenance** in recent weeks, saying that this **was needed for safety reasons**.
由于多烧煤意味着更多亏损，一些发电厂已在最近几周停产检修，并称这是安全生产的要求。 

The regulators **cited a need** to make sure that the cities and provinces **met full-year targets** set by Beijing for their **carbon dioxide emissions** from the **burning of fossil fuels**. If people begin to **point fingers**, there are few others to blame.
监管部?说，这样做是为了确保各省市实现中央制定的来自燃烧化石燃料的二氧化碳排放全年目标。 如果想指责谁的话，几乎没有其他人可指责。

**Disruptions from power shortages** have already **been felt** in Dongguan, a city at the heart of China’s southern **manufacturing belt**.
中国南方的制造业中心东莞已感受到了电力短缺带来的干扰。

The **throaty roar** of huge **diesel generators rumbled** on Monday morning through the streets and **alleys** of Houjie, where **scores of five-story, concrete-walled** factories are **nestled among** low-rise apartment buildings for migrant workers. 
周一上午，厚街镇的大街小巷里响彻着巨型柴油发电机的刺耳轰鸣声。在这里，有数十家水泥墙围起来的五层楼高的工厂，它们周围是打工者居住的低层公寓楼。

One of the **noisy generators rumbled** in a 20-foot yellow shipping container behind a factory where workers in bright blue and orange **jumpsuits** labored to **assemble men's and women’s leather shoes** for American and European buyers.
其中一台嘈杂的发电机，在一家工厂后面六米?的?色集装箱里轰鸣。工厂里，穿着鲜蓝和橙色工装的工人正在为美国和欧洲的消费者组装男式和女式皮鞋。

Mr. Tang had to **turn off his generator** for two days last week after local residents **filed noise complaints** with the local government. He also **rented a metal cage to cover** the generator to **reduce the din**. Some in the **neighborhood, particularly shoe component manufacturers**, were **sympathetic, voicing a mixture** of business **pragmatism and nationalism**.
上周，因为当地居?向政府投诉噪音问题，唐先生不得不停开了两天发电机。他还租了一个金属笼子把发电机罩起来，以减少噪音。社区里有些人，尤其是鞋零部件的制造商们，对噪音问题表示同情， 这是一种既带有商业实用主义、也带有?族主义的态度。

The International Olympic Committee on Wednesday released **a preliminary set of health protocols** for the upcoming Winter Games in Beijing. The Beijing Olympic and **Paralympic Games** will **take place** in what organizers called a “**closed-loop management system**,” a bubblelike environment. Those within the bubble also will **be subject to** daily coronavirus testing.
周三，国际奥委会发布了即将在北京举行的冬奥会的初步卫生政策. 北京冬奥会和冬残奥会将在组织者所说的“闭环管理系统”中举行. 泡泡中的人将每日接受新冠病毒检测。

Anyone, including athletes, **intending to enter this bubble** has two choices: Arrive in China **fully vaccinated** or prepare to spend the first 21 days in Beijing in **solitary quarantine**.
包括运动员在内，任何人想要进入这个泡泡都有两个选择:抵达中国前完成疫苗接种，或者准备好先在北京进行21天的单独隔离。

And while **spectators** will be allowed to return to **competition venues** after being **largely barred** from the recent Summer Games in Tokyo, entry will be limited to those **residing in** mainland China.
最近的东京夏季奥运会基本禁止观众进入比赛场地，北京冬奥会虽然将允许观众进入，但仅限于居住在中国大陆的观众。

The Summer Olympics in Tokyo **featured a far more porous health protocol**. Participants were not required to be vaccinated, nor **sequestered** if they were not, and while they were asked to try to remain **within Games-affiliated venues**, they **were still afforded** plenty of opportunities to interact with the outside world, including **at convenience stores** and local restaurants for **takeout meals**. 
东京夏季奥运会的防疫政策的管控远不如北京严格。参与者未被要求接种疫苗，未接种也不需要隔离，虽然他们被要求尽量留在奥运会相关的场馆内，但仍有很多机会与外界互动，包括在便利店和当地餐厅取外卖?物。

There’s very **little insulation** left on **the wiring** in the relationship, and it’s not hard to imagine **getting some crossed wires** and that starting a fire. The Taiwan issue has **ceased to be a sort of narrow, boutique issue**, and it’s become **a central theater** ― if not the **central drama** ― in U.S.-China strategic competition
在中美关系中，绝缘保护层所剩无几，某些电线交错导致起火的事情并不遥远。台湾已不再是个波及面狭窄的小问题，它已经成为美中战略竞争的中心舞台――甚至可以说是主线剧情

All three have **sought to show resolve** in hopes of **averting war**, only to **provoke countermoves** that **compound distrust** and increase the risk of **miscalculation**.
三方都试图表现出希望避免战争的决心，却制造了反效果，这加深了不信任，也增加了误判的风险。

Taiwan independence was a **grave lurking threat to national rejuvenation**. Nobody should **underestimate the staunch determination, firm will** and powerful ability of the Chinese people to **defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity**.
台独是“民族复兴的严重隐患”。任何人都不要低估中国人民捍卫国家主权和领土完整的坚强决心、坚定意志、强大能力

Few believe a war is **imminent or foreordained, in part because** the economic and diplomatic **aftershocks would be staggering** for China.
很少有人相信战争即将到来或注定爆发，部分原因是对中国而言，战争所带来的经济和外交打击将无比巨大。

**Some individuals still try to completely deny** the War of Resistance against the United States and Aid Korea, **question the justice** of sending troops, and try to **erase** the great victory, No matter how they **distort, obliterate, falsify, tease and denigrate the facts**, history is written in the hearts of the people.
仍有个别人试图全盘否定抗美援朝战争，质疑出兵正义性，试图抹杀伟大胜利，无论他们对事实如何歪曲、涂抹、篡改、戏谑、诋毁，历史写在人民心中。

The film has **smashed records** since opening on Sept. 30, **on the eve of** China’s National Day. In its first week, it has already **grossed $552 million**, according to Maoyan, the ticketing service, already making it **the eighth-most-successful film** in China’s history.
自9月30日国庆前夕上映以来，《长津湖》打破多项纪录。根据猫眼票务的数据，该片在上映第一周就获得了15.27亿元的票房，目前已是中国电影史上票房排名第八的作品。

A decade ago, the Chinese government **systematically dismantled** the C.I.A.’s spying operation in the country, with **informants captured** or killed. Some former officials have **blamed a breach** of the agency’s **classified communications system**, while others have blamed a former C.I.A. officer **later convicted** of giving secrets to China. Since then, the agency has tried to rebuild its networks, but the Chinese government’s power to track the movements and communications of people has **slowed the effort**.
十年前，中国政府系统瓦解了中情局在该国的间谍活动，线人或被捕或遭处决。一些前官员认为这是由于中情局的机密通讯系统遭到破坏，另一些人则怪罪到一名前中情局官员身上，此人后来因向中国提供机密情报而被定罪。此后，中情局一直试图重建间谍网络，但中国政府追踪相关行动和通信的能力阻碍了这项工作取得进展。

**In the jargon** of the C.I.A., **tradecraft** is the skills spies use to **evade adversarial operatives**, find new sources and communicate with them **securely**. Technological advances by countries like China have **forced the agency to** update and improve their tradecraft. 
用中情局的行话来说，谍报技术就是间谍用来躲避敌方特工、寻找新情报来源，并与之进行安全通讯的技能。中国等国家的技术进步迫使中情局不得不更新和改进谍报技术。

The appointment in 2017 of Mr. D’Andrea, who had **a long career leading operations** against Al Qaeda and other terrorist targets, was **a sign of** the Trump administration’s **hard line on Iran**. And inside the C.I.A., Mr. D’Andrea **helped craft a more muscular approach** against Tehran.
丹德烈亚曾长期领导打击基地组织(Al Qaeda)和其他恐怖主义目标的行动，他在2017年的任命表明了特朗普政府对伊朗的强硬立场。而在中情局内部，丹德烈亚帮助制定了对抗德黑兰的更强硬手段。

**Throughout his time** in the agency, Mr. D’Andrea **worked undercover**, even as he took senior leadership roles, and the agency would not **publicly acknowledge** or discuss his role. But with his retirement, his work can ever so **slightly emerge from the shadows**. Mr. Burns said Thursday that Mr. D’Andrea had had **a “remarkable impact**.”
丹德烈亚在中情局一直从事卧底工作，即使担任高级领导职务后，中情局也没有公开承认或讨论过他的角色。但在退休之后，他所做的工作也可以露出冰山一角。伯恩斯周四表示，丹德烈亚发挥了“重要的作用”。

Access to senior policymakers doesn’t **work its magic as much as before**, either. Stephen Schwarzman, head of the **private equity** giant Blackstone, has **long cultivated relationships** with the Chinese leadership. He is tight with Liu He, the country’s **economic czar**.
与高层决策者的接触不再像以前那么有用了。私募股权巨头黑石集团负责人苏世民多年来一直在培养与领导层的关系。他与“经济沙皇”刘鹤往来密切。

The Wall Street firms are **apparently betting** that China’s past successes will continue. They have **a long track record on their side**, but they would **do well to** remember what they constantly tell their customers: Past performance isn’t **necessarily indicative** of future results.
华尔街的企业显然在押注中国能够延续过往的成功。长久以来的成就支持了他们的立场，但最好别忘了他们一直告诫客户的话：过去的业绩并不一定能预示未来的结果。

China is **reshaping how business works** and limiting executives’ power. **Long in coming, but rapid in execution**, the policies are **driven by a desire** for state control and **self-reliance** as well as concerns about debt, **inequality** and influence by foreign countries, including the United States.
中国正在重塑企业运作方式，限制高管权力。这些政策酝酿已久，但执行迅速，其驱动因素正是对控制国家和自力更生的渴望，以及对债务、不平等和包括美国在内的外国影响的担忧。

At China’s annual World Internet Conference last week, an official **signaled that** efforts to **rein in** internet giants were not over, warning against the “**disorderly expansion of capital**.” Once **a showcase for the might** of China’s entrepreneurs, this year’s conference became a platform for **pledging fealty to state efforts to spread the wealth**.
上周在中国举行的年度世界互联网大会上，一位官员表示，对互联网巨头的管制还没有结束，要警惕“资本无序扩张”。这里曾是展示中国企业家强大实力的舞台，今年却成了支持国家财富分配举措的誓师大会。

Alibaba’s chief executive, Daniel Zhang, **hailed his firm’s new $15.5 billion plan** to help small business and **underdeveloped regions**, invoking **the aphorism “If you teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime.”**
阿里巴巴首席执行官张勇称赞了该公司旨在帮助小企业和欠发达地区的价值155亿美元对新计划，并引用了一句格言：“授人以鱼，不如授人以渔。”

Companies **focused on the consumer internet** have lost the protections they once enjoyed. Instead, the government is focused on **a push for** national self-reliance, **countenancing big bets on bleeding-edge** technology, **partly in response to** United States policies that **cut off access to** key components like microchips. Officials have **heavily subsidized** manufacturers of semiconductors, commercial aircraft, electric cars and other products.
专注于消费者互联网的公司失去了它们曾经享有的保护。政府转而专注于推动国家自力更生，支持在尖端技术上的大笔投入，部分是为了回应美国切断微芯片等关键部件供应的政策。政府对半导体、商用飞机、电动汽车和其他产品的制造商给予了大量补贴。

It was **a stark reminder** that they are not like you. There are **hierarchies** in Chinese society, and different treatment **comes with it**, Still, **part of me wonders for** how long. 
这是一个鲜明的提醒，他们和你不一样。中国社会有等级制度，不同的待遇也随之而来，不过，我还是有点想知道这能持续多久。

On the **northern edge** of a vast Chinese factory city, **welding torches gleam** as workers finish construction on a **gas-fired power plant** to replace one that burned coal and **blanketed the surrounding neighborhood in a sooty pall**.
在中国这座巨大的工厂之城的北郊，闪烁着电焊的火光，工人们正在完成一个燃气发电厂的建设工作，新电厂将取代令周遭笼罩在烟尘下的燃煤电厂。

This **archipelago** of power plants **underlines an unsettling reality** in the global fight to slow climate change. China burns more fossil fuels than any other nation, making it the planet’s top source of the **greenhouse gases** that are warming the Earth. And its **voracious appetite** for electricity is only growing.
这些正在建设的发电厂凸显了全球减缓气候变化努力的一个令人不安的现实。中国的化石燃料消耗比世界上其他国家都要多，使其成为全球最大的温室气体排放国，温室气体排放是地球变暖的原因。而且，中国对电力的强烈胃口仍在变大。

Just weeks before a critical United Nations **climate summit** in Glasgow, attention **is riveted** on China and whether it will do more to cut emissions. The world’s top energy agency said last week that China “**has the means and capacity**” to reduce its pollution. 
几周后，联合国将在格拉斯哥召开重要的气候峰会，人们目前的注意力都集中在中国，以及它是否会采取更多减排措施上。世界最高能源机构上周表示，中国“有(减少污染)的途径和能力”

China has taken some important steps this year to begin to **curb its use** of coal, the **dirtiest** of fossil fuels. Some provinces, like **coastal** Shandong, **mandated over** the summer that some of their oldest, **least efficient** coal-fired plants be closed.
中国今年已采取了一些重要措施，开始限制煤炭使用，这是一种最脏的化石燃料。一些省份(比如沿海的山东)已在今年夏天下令关停了省内最老、效率最低的燃煤电厂。

Each year, China burns more coal than the rest of the world **combined** and **almost as much oil as** the United States. But it is also **making heavy investments in clean energy**. China is the world leader in **hydroelectric power**, in solar power and in wind power. While China has mostly **run out of rivers to dam** for hydroelectric power. China needs to find a way to produce even more energy while reducing emissions at the same time ― **a tall order**.
中国每年的煤炭消耗量超过世界其他国家的总和，每年的石油消耗量几乎与美国相当。但中国也正在大量投资清洁能源领域。中国在水力发电、太阳能和? 电领域都处于世界领先地位。虽然中国可建造水力发电大坝的河流已所剩无几.中国需要找到一个在生产更多电能的同时减少碳排放的方法，这是个艰巨的任务。

American energy use was **nearly flat** over the decade before the pandemic and then **fell sharply** last year. Europe’s energy use was **gradually declining** even before the pandemic.
美国的能源消耗在新冠病毒大流行前的十年里几乎没有增?，并在去年出现了大幅下降。欧洲的能源消耗甚至在疫情之前就在逐渐下降。

The United States **in particular** has been able to reduce emissions by **gradually shifting** from coal power to a **greater reliance** on natural gas, which emits about half the carbon dioxide when burned, and by **ramping up its renewable energy**.
具体到美国来说，美国一直能够通过逐渐从燃煤转向更大程度地依赖天然气(燃烧天然气排放的二氧化碳量约是燃煤的一半)，以及增加可再生能源的使用来减少碳排放。

The United States and other countries are **pressuring China to** agree to help limit global warming this century to no more than 1.5 **degrees Celsius** compared with temperatures before **the Industrial Revolution**. That’s the **threshold beyond** which scientists say the planet will **experience irreversible damage**. As countries continue to **pump carbon emissions into** the atmosphere, the Earth has already warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius.
美国和其他国家正在向中国施压，要求它同意帮助实现将本世纪全球变暖幅度控制在不高于工业革命前1.5摄氏度的目标。科学家说，变暖超过这个阈值，将让地球受到不可逆转的破坏。随着各国继续向大气层排放二氧化碳，地球的温度已经上升了约1.1摄氏度。

**Complicating matters** is China’s view that climate change is **primarily** an American responsibility. That’s because former President Donald J. Trump in 2017 **withdrew the United States from the Paris agreement**, the pact among nations to fight climate change. That decision that **essentially stopped** climate progress by the U.S. for four years.
让问题变得复杂的是，中国认为气候变化主要是美国的责任。这是因为前总统特朗普曾在2017年让美国退出了各国为应对气候变化签订的《巴黎协定》。特朗普的决定实质上让美国在气候问题上的进展 停滞了四年。

Just five years ago, three **inland regions** that create **abundant** solar and wind energy power ― **sparsely populated** Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Gansu ― were **wasting up to** two-fifths of that power. To **address this problem**, China has built **ultra-high-voltage transmission lines** linking the country’s **interior to hubs** near the coast.But connectivity still has a ways to go. 
就在五年前，三个拥有丰富太阳能和?能的内陆地区――人口稀少的内蒙古、新疆和甘肃――生产的电能有高达40%被浪费。为了解决这个问题，中国修建了将内陆与沿海地区连接起来的超高压输电线。但仍需建设更多的输电线。

现在上演的是拉锯战，中央政府正在试图减少煤炭生产，而地方政府正在干相反的事情。

A **bicycle mechanic** who works and lives near the new gas-fired power plant being completed on the northern edge of Dongguan, said that he certainly did not miss the coal plant. Clothes **got dirty if you hung them outside**, white cars got dirty after being **parked here for a while**. He is **unenthusiastic about** power plants in general.
一名自行?修理工，他工作和生活的地方就在东莞北郊即将建成的新燃气发电厂附近。他说，他一点也不想念那个燃煤发电厂。衣服挂在外面，会给弄脏。白色的?子停在这儿，过会儿也脏了. 他对发电厂的总体态度是没有热情。

The men and women **wrestled** Wang Jianna to the ground. **Holding down her legs and shoulders**, they **pried** her 6-month-old baby from her arms and **took off running**. A **surveillance camera captured** it all. But there **was little Ms. Wang could do**.
几名男女把王建娜摔倒在地，按住她的肩膀和腿，把她六个月大的孩子从她怀里拽出来，然后跑开了。一个监控摄像头拍下了这一切。但王建娜无能为力

I **feel deeply wronged**, Although snatching is **unreasonable and unjustified**, the **court** still supported it.

**Custody battles** can be **bitter affairs** anywhere in the world. In China, where courts **rarely grant joint physical** custody, **disputes** over children are **especially acrimonious**. It creates **a perverse incentive** for parents **going through a split to abduct** and hide their children to win **sole** custody. 
在世界上任何地方，监护权之争都是可能令人痛苦的事情。在中国，法院很少授予共同监护权，关于孩子的纠纷尤其激烈。这给离异中的父母带来了一种反常的动机，让他们为了赢得单独抚养权而绑架和藏匿自己的孩子。

“It’s **become almost a game** ― whoever has physical custody has **legal custody**,” said Dai Xiaolei, who founded **Purple Ribbon** Mother’s Love, **a grass-roots advocacy group**, after losing a custody battle with her ex-husband. “**It’s a free-for-all**.”
“这几乎变成了一场游戏――谁有了实际监护权，谁就有法律监护权，”戴晓磊说。“完全是无法无天。”她在与前夫的监护权之争中败诉后，创立了草根维权组织“紫丝带妈妈”。

**Traditionally**, a woman seeking a divorce was expected to **forgo custody** of her children. But that has changed over the years as women in China have **gained more financial stability** and independence. **On paper**, Chinese law **is tilted slightly in favor of** women. **In cases** where the child is 2 or younger, mothers are **typically awarded** sole custody. But **in practice**, judges can **be swayed by institutional and informal considerations** that experts say often give men an advantage. 
传统上，人们会认为寻求离婚的女性理应放弃对孩子的监护权。但是多年来，随着中国女性获得了更多经济上的稳定和独立，这种情况发生了变化。理论上，中国法律稍微偏向于女性。在孩子两岁或更小的情况下，母亲通常被授予唯一监护权。但在实践中，法官可能会受到制度和非正式理由的影响，专家们说，这些考虑往往会给男性带来优势。
