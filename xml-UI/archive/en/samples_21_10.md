Xu Jiayin was China’s richest man, a symbol of the country’s economic rise who helped **transform poverty-stricken** villages into **urbanized metropolises** for the **fledgling** middle class. He **amassed the trappings** of the elite, with trips to Paris to taste rare French wines, a million-dollar **yacht**, private jets
中国曾经的首富许家印是该国经济崛起的象征，他帮助贫困的村庄转变为新兴中产阶级的城市化大都市。他过着精英的生活，去巴黎品尝稀有的法国葡萄酒，拥有价值百万美元的游艇、私人飞机

 Last week, the company, which has unpaid bills **totaling more than** $300 billion, missed a key payment to foreign investors. That sent the world into **a panic** over whether China was facing its own **so-called** Lehman moment
 上周，负债总计超过3000亿美元的该公司未能向外国投资者支付一笔重要款项。这让世界陷入恐慌，怀疑中国是否正面临着自己的雷曼时刻

 The company’s crisis is testing the **resolve** of Chinese leaders’ efforts to reform as they **chart a new course** for the country’s economy.
 恒大的危机正在考验中国领导人在为国家经济开辟新道路时进行改革的决心。

 The term ‘**paradigm shift**’ is always **overused**, so people **tend to ignore** it. But that’s a good way of describing what’s happening right now.
 ‘范式转变’这个词被用烂了，所以往往不为人们所重视。但这是对目前正在发生的事情最贴切的描述。

 Mr. Xu and his company have **mirrored** China’s own economic **ascent** from an **agrarian economy** to one that **embraced** capitalism.
 许家印和他的公司折射出中国从农业经济到拥抱资本主义的崛起。

 Mr. Xu grew Evergrande from a **small outfit** with fewer than a dozen employees into China’s most **prolific** developer through a **combination** of **rampant borrowing** and elite political **connections**. 
 许家印通过大肆借贷和精英政治关系的结合，将恒大从一家只有不到十几名员工的小公司发展成为中国最多产的开发商。

 The party flew to Europe **on a private jet**, with the men playing a popular Chinese card game called “**fight the landlord**.” 
 一行人乘坐私人飞机飞往欧洲，男人们玩一种叫做“斗地主”的纸牌游戏。

 To **supercharge** Evergrande’s growth, Mr. Xu often borrowed twice **on each piece of land** that he developed ― first from the bank and then from home buyers who were **sometimes willing to** pay 100 percent of the value of their future home before it was built.
 为了推动恒大发展，许家印经常拿他开发的项目贷款两次――先是向银行，然后向购房者，这些购房者有时愿意在房子建成前支付100%的房款。

 Xu Jiayin **represents a very important aspect** of China’s economic reform, He used **his wits and his daring** to very, very **aggressively** expand his business, **oftentimes dangerously** so, **from a financial accounting perspective**.
 许家印代表了中国经济改革的一个非常重要的方面，他运用自己的智慧和勇气，非常、非常积极地扩大了自己的业务，从财务会计的角度来看，有时是非常危险的。

**With access to** cheap money and **unbridled** ambition, Mr. Xu expanded into areas in which Evergrande had no experience or expertise, including bottled water, electric cars, **pig farming** and professional sports. His electric vehicle company had a **bold vision** to become bigger and more powerful than Tesla; so far it has delayed **mass production**.
凭借廉价的资金和不受限制的野心，许家印扩张到了恒大没有经验或专长的领域，包括瓶装水、电动汽车、养猪和职业体育。他的电动车公司有一个大胆的愿景，要成为比特斯拉更大、更强的公司；到目前为止，它已经推迟了量产。

If Beijing tries to **make an example out of** Evergrande by letting it collapse, the wealth of millions of people could **vanish along with** Mr. Xu’s empire.
如果北京试图杀鸡儆猴，让恒大破产，数百万人的财富可能会随着许家印的帝国一起消失。

**Amid concerns** that an Evergrande **demise** could **spread through** the Chinese economy, Beijing **unleashed a flood of capital into** China’s banking system last week, **a move** that was seen as **an attempt** to **calm market jitters**.
在人们担心恒大破产可能波及整个中国经济之际，北京上周向中国的银行体系注入了大量资金，此举被视为试图平息市场的不安情绪。

 When China’s economy began to **cool down**, the damage caused by Evergrande’s **voracious appetite** for debt became impossible to ignore. 
 当中国经济开始降温时，恒大贪婪的借债欲望造成的损害变得不可忽视。

 **Debt-saddled** corporate giants like Evergrande were given the freedom to open their **bloody mouths** and **devour the wealth** of our country and our people until they are **too big to fall**, China’s economy and society will be set on the **crater of the volcano** where all may be **ignited** any time.
 像恒大这样负债累累的企业巨头被赋予自由，任其张开血盆大口吞噬我们国家和国民的财富；直到其大到不能倒. 中国经济和社会就会被架上火山口，随着都可能被点燃。

 President Biden has been **working hard to make the pivot to** Asia that his two **predecessors** never **quite managed**.
 拜登总统一直努力转向亚洲，这是他的两位前任都未能完全做到的事。

 It risks **compromising** long-term **nonproliferation interests** in favor of **near-term** militarism. It directs **immense** resources to **ineffective** strategies. It reacts to China’s military **buildup** but does not provide a **credible deterrent** or **seriously alter** the regional military balance against Beijing.
 它有可能为了短期的穷兵黩武而损害长期的防核扩散利益。它将大量资源用于无效的战略。它对中国的军事建设做出反应，但没有提供可靠的威慑力，也没有实质改变针对北京的地区军事平衡。

 It is **far more** difficult for the United States and its allies to **project power** thousands of miles to Taiwan than it is for China to project power 100 miles across the **Taiwan Strait**. U.S. aircraft **simply cannot** fly enough **sorties** to overwhelm both China’s aircraft and its missile defense systems. The AUKUS agreement does not **change these facts**. And any **marginal gains** are likely to be too little, too late. 
 美国及其盟友向数千英里外的台湾投射力量，要比中国向台湾海峡对面160公里外投射力量困难得多。美国飞机根本无法飞行足够的架次来压倒中国的飞机和它的导弹防御系统。AUKUS协议不会改变这些事实。任何边际收益都可能太少、太迟。

 Neither AUKUS **submarines** nor U.S. **bombers** flying from northern Australia are likely to **tip the balance** if they **are dedicated to** the same **losing strategy**. 
 无论是AUKUS的潜艇，还是从澳大利亚北部起飞的美国轰炸机，如果服务于同样的失败战略，它们都不可能改变平衡。

 This is a **hallmark** of great power competition: Competitive initiatives like AUKUS provide visible ways to **counter or balance or complicate** China’s military activities but don’t necessarily help allies meet defined objectives. **More often**, competition becomes **an end in itself** ― an **open-ended imperative** that assumes everything an **opponent dislikes** must be good policy. Another **common feature** of competitive policies is that officials tend to **overlook** their costs.
 这就是大国竞争的特点：要对中国的军事活动进行反制或平衡或干扰，像AUKUS这样的竞争性倡议可以给出显见的途径，不过这不等于就能帮助盟友实现其中所明确的目标。更常见的可能是，竞争本身成了目的――这是一种无休止的要求，即假定只要是对手不喜欢的东西就肯定是好政策。竞争性政策的另一个常见特性是官员倾向于无视成本。

 **For one thing**, AUKUS carries significant diplomatic costs **at a time** when the United States is **in desperate need of** credibility with its allies. France views AUKUS as “a knife in the back”, That **perceived betrayal** could cause unnecessary **friction** in NATO 
 首先一点，此时此刻盟友的信任正是美国迫切需要的，而AUKUS包含了巨大的外交成本。法国认为AUKUS是“背后捅刀”，这被认为是一次背叛，可能在北约内部导致不必要的摩擦

The Biden administration should **take a breath and make certain** it does not reflect a **self-defeating, militarized** concept of great power that pushes other potential partners away in **bullheaded pursuit** of agreement on one issue. It should **institute** strong nonproliferation safeguards, repair damage to other **vital alliances** and ensure that the plan isn’t **throwing good money** after bad strategy.
拜登政府需要静下来想清楚，此举会不会显得像一种弄巧成拙的军事化大国概念，导致其他潜在合作者被这种对单一问题协议的固执追求吓跑。协议需要制定强有力的不扩散防护措施，修复它给其他重要盟友造成的伤害，确保这不是在把钱浪费在糟糕的战略上。

**Too often**, a **narrow focus** on great power competition just leaves America **less competitive** in the **long run**.
在大国竞争中，过分关注某一点经常导致美国丧失长远的竞争力。

There’s very **little insulation** left on **the wiring** in the relationship, and it’s not hard to imagine **getting some crossed wires** and that starting a fire. The Taiwan issue has **ceased to be a sort of narrow, boutique issue**, and it’s become **a central theater** ― if not the **central drama** ― in U.S.-China strategic competition
在中美关系中，绝缘保护层所剩无几，某些电线交错导致起火的事情并不遥远。台湾已不再是个波及面狭窄的小问题，它已经成为美中战略竞争的中心舞台――甚至可以说是主线剧情

All three have **sought to show resolve** in hopes of **averting war**, only to **provoke countermoves** that **compound distrust** and increase the risk of **miscalculation**.
三方都试图表现出希望避免战争的决心，却制造了反效果，这加深了不信任，也增加了误判的风险。

Taiwan independence was a **grave lurking threat to national rejuvenation**. Nobody should **underestimate the staunch determination, firm will** and powerful ability of the Chinese people to **defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity**.
台独是“民族复兴的严重隐患”。任何人都不要低估中国人民捍卫国家主权和领土完整的坚强决心、坚定意志、强大能力

Few believe a war is **imminent or foreordained, in part because** the economic and diplomatic **aftershocks would be staggering** for China.
很少有人相信战争即将到来或注定爆发，部分原因是对中国而言，战争所带来的经济和外交打击将无比巨大。

**Some individuals still try to completely deny** the War of Resistance against the United States and Aid Korea, **question the justice** of sending troops, and try to **erase** the great victory, No matter how they **distort, obliterate, falsify, tease and denigrate the facts**, history is written in the hearts of the people.
仍有个别人试图全盘否定抗美援朝战争，质疑出兵正义性，试图抹杀伟大胜利，无论他们对事实如何歪曲、涂抹、篡改、戏谑、诋毁，历史写在人民心中。

The film has **smashed records** since opening on Sept. 30, **on the eve of** China’s National Day. In its first week, it has already **grossed $552 million**, according to Maoyan, the ticketing service, already making it **the eighth-most-successful film** in China’s history.
自9月30日国庆前夕上映以来，《长津湖》打破多项纪录。根据猫眼票务的数据，该片在上映第一周就获得了15.27亿元的票房，目前已是中国电影史上票房排名第八的作品。

A decade ago, the Chinese government **systematically dismantled** the C.I.A.’s spying operation in the country, with **informants captured** or killed. Some former officials have **blamed a breach** of the agency’s **classified communications system**, while others have blamed a former C.I.A. officer **later convicted** of giving secrets to China. Since then, the agency has tried to rebuild its networks, but the Chinese government’s power to track the movements and communications of people has **slowed the effort**.
十年前，中国政府系统瓦解了中情局在该国的间谍活动，线人或被捕或遭处决。一些前官员认为这是由于中情局的机密通讯系统遭到破坏，另一些人则怪罪到一名前中情局官员身上，此人后来因向中国提供机密情报而被定罪。此后，中情局一直试图重建间谍网络，但中国政府追踪相关行动和通信的能力阻碍了这项工作取得进展。

**In the jargon** of the C.I.A., **tradecraft** is the skills spies use to **evade adversarial operatives**, find new sources and communicate with them **securely**. Technological advances by countries like China have **forced the agency to** update and improve their tradecraft. 
用中情局的行话来说，谍报技术就是间谍用来躲避敌方特工、寻找新情报来源，并与之进行安全通讯的技能。中国等国家的技术进步迫使中情局不得不更新和改进谍报技术。

The appointment in 2017 of Mr. D’Andrea, who had **a long career leading operations** against Al Qaeda and other terrorist targets, was **a sign of** the Trump administration’s **hard line on Iran**. And inside the C.I.A., Mr. D’Andrea **helped craft a more muscular approach** against Tehran.
丹德烈亚曾长期领导打击基地组织(Al Qaeda)和其他恐怖主义目标的行动，他在2017年的任命表明了特朗普政府对伊朗的强硬立场。而在中情局内部，丹德烈亚帮助制定了对抗德黑兰的更强硬手段。

**Throughout his time** in the agency, Mr. D’Andrea **worked undercover**, even as he took senior leadership roles, and the agency would not **publicly acknowledge** or discuss his role. But with his retirement, his work can ever so **slightly emerge from the shadows**. Mr. Burns said Thursday that Mr. D’Andrea had had **a “remarkable impact**.”
丹德烈亚在中情局一直从事卧底工作，即使担任高级领导职务后，中情局也没有公开承认或讨论过他的角色。但在退休之后，他所做的工作也可以露出冰山一角。伯恩斯周四表示，丹德烈亚发挥了“重要的作用”。

Access to senior policymakers doesn’t **work its magic as much as before**, either. Stephen Schwarzman, head of the **private equity** giant Blackstone, has **long cultivated relationships** with the Chinese leadership. He is tight with Liu He, the country’s **economic czar**.
与高层决策者的接触不再像以前那么有用了。私募股权巨头黑石集团负责人苏世民多年来一直在培养与领导层的关系。他与“经济沙皇”刘鹤往来密切。

The Wall Street firms are **apparently betting** that China’s past successes will continue. They have **a long track record on their side**, but they would **do well to** remember what they constantly tell their customers: Past performance isn’t **necessarily indicative** of future results.
华尔街的企业显然在押注中国能够延续过往的成功。长久以来的成就支持了他们的立场，但最好别忘了他们一直告诫客户的话：过去的业绩并不一定能预示未来的结果。

China is **reshaping how business works** and limiting executives’ power. **Long in coming, but rapid in execution**, the policies are **driven by a desire** for state control and **self-reliance** as well as concerns about debt, **inequality** and influence by foreign countries, including the United States.
中国正在重塑企业运作方式，限制高管权力。这些政策酝酿已久，但执行迅速，其驱动因素正是对控制国家和自力更生的渴望，以及对债务、不平等和包括美国在内的外国影响的担忧。

At China’s annual World Internet Conference last week, an official **signaled that** efforts to **rein in** internet giants were not over, warning against the “**disorderly expansion of capital**.” Once **a showcase for the might** of China’s entrepreneurs, this year’s conference became a platform for **pledging fealty to state efforts to spread the wealth**.
上周在中国举行的年度世界互联网大会上，一位官员表示，对互联网巨头的管制还没有结束，要警惕“资本无序扩张”。这里曾是展示中国企业家强大实力的舞台，今年却成了支持国家财富分配举措的誓师大会。

Alibaba’s chief executive, Daniel Zhang, **hailed his firm’s new $15.5 billion plan** to help small business and **underdeveloped regions**, invoking **the aphorism “If you teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime.”**
阿里巴巴首席执行官张勇称赞了该公司旨在帮助小企业和欠发达地区的价值155亿美元对新计划，并引用了一句格言：“授人以鱼，不如授人以渔。”

Companies **focused on the consumer internet** have lost the protections they once enjoyed. Instead, the government is focused on **a push for** national self-reliance, **countenancing big bets on bleeding-edge** technology, **partly in response to** United States policies that **cut off access to** key components like microchips. Officials have **heavily subsidized** manufacturers of semiconductors, commercial aircraft, electric cars and other products.
专注于消费者互联网的公司失去了它们曾经享有的保护。政府转而专注于推动国家自力更生，支持在尖端技术上的大笔投入，部分是为了回应美国切断微芯片等关键部件供应的政策。政府对半导体、商用飞机、电动汽车和其他产品的制造商给予了大量补贴。

It was **a stark reminder** that they are not like you. There are **hierarchies** in Chinese society, and different treatment **comes with it**, Still, **part of me wonders for** how long. 
这是一个鲜明的提醒，他们和你不一样。中国社会有等级制度，不同的待遇也随之而来，不过，我还是有点想知道这能持续多久。
