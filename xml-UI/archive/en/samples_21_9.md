Now here we are, **on the cusp of** the release of Marvel’s “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” the first big-budget American **blockbuster** to center on an **honest-to-goodness** Asian superhero. The film **stars** Simu Liu, who **whirls into action** with all the unique **splendor promised by** a movie that **fuses the eye-popping spectacle** of Chinese **martial arts** with Hollywood’s **unparalleled storytelling** technology.
现在，漫威的《尚气与十环传奇》?上就要上映，这是第一部围绕诚实善良的亚洲超级英雄为中心的美国大片。影片由刘思慕主演，独创的特效结合炫目的中国武术场面，剧情以好莱坞无可比拟的叙事技巧展开。

When we’re first introduced to our **titular protagonist** ― going by **the westernized name** “Shaun” ― he’s **depicted as a good-natured**, smiling **parking valet** who **nods and stammers when condescended to**. He **begs his over-the-top** BFF Katy (Nora “Awkwafina” Lum) not to make noise or trouble.
片名中的主?――使用?化的名字“肖恩”――第一次出场时，他被描绘成一个善良、面带微笑的泊?员，当有人居高临下地对待他时，他会点头，还会结巴。他恳求他最好的朋友、行为乖张的凯蒂 (“奥卡菲娜”林家珍饰)不要制造噪音或麻烦。

He’s **living as** many of our Asian parents **counseled** us: “**The nail that sticks up gets hammered down**,” they said. They encouraged us to **blend in**, to **adopt cultural camouflage**, to **avoid standing out** in ways that might make us vulnerable to the racial targeting that they may have experienced themselves.
他的生活就像许多亚裔父母劝告我们的那样――“枪打出头?”，他们说。他们鼓励我们融入其中，采用文化伪装，避免引人注目，那样可能会让我们容易受到他们可能曾经历过的种族针对。

But it’s **not long before** Shaun **rips off his metaphorical glasses** and **steps unabashedly into the spotlight** as Shang-Chi, a **larger-than-life, pyrotechnic presence** who draws every eye and fills the screen as only superheroes can.
但没过多久，肖恩摘下他那副带有隐喻色彩的眼镜，毫不掩饰地以“尚气”的形象出现在聚光灯下，这是一个超凡脱俗、光芒四射的出场，他主宰着屏幕，吸引了所有的目光，这是只有超级英雄才有的气场。

For those of us who **ultimately rebelled against** our parents’ advice to **shrink ourselves**, Shang Chi’s **heroic arrival** is a **satisfying refutation** of their warnings. Don’t raise your voice. Don’t draw attention. Don’t **take up space**. This was **well-meaning counsel**, but it had **tremendous unintended consequences**, leading many of us to avoid **asserting our Asian heritage**.
对于我们这些最终不顾父母劝说的人来说，尚气的英勇到来是对他们警告的驳斥，令人感到极度舒适。不要大声。不要引起注意。不要占据空间。这是善意的建议，但它产生了意想不到的巨大后果，导致我们中的许多人不愿主张我们的亚裔传统。

**In the course of** conducting interviews for our **forthcoming book**, a history of Asian America from the nineties to now, Phil Yu, Philip Wang and I spoke with Asian American journalists who avoided covering their own communities for **fear of being boxed into an ethnic niche**. We heard from Asian American authors who **resisted writing Asian American lead characters** into their novels. We talked to Asian American performers who’d **normalized the expectation** that they could only be **secondary players, onscreen** and in life.
我们即将出版一本新书，讲述关于90年代至今亚裔美国人的历史，在进行采访的过程中，我和菲尔・柳、菲利普・王采访了一些亚裔美国记者，他们不愿报道自己种族社区的新闻，因为害怕被当作一个小众种族群体。我们听说亚裔美国作家拒绝将亚裔美国主?写入他们的小说。我们还与一些亚裔美国演员进行了交谈，他们已经接受了人们只指望他们扮演次要?色，无论是在银幕上还是在生活中。

Sandra Oh, now leading Netflix’s **hot-topic dramedy** “The Chair,” told us that when she found out she was being **offered a spot** in the **cat- and-mouse assassin thriller** “Killing Eve,” she **assumed** it would be for **a recurring role or supporting character**. “I **looked through the script**, and I couldn’t find an Asian doctor or **receptionist or whatever**,” she **recalled**. “And that’s when my agent told me that they wanted me for the lead. For Eve. The character in the title. That’s the moment that I realized how deep the **internalized racism** had been for me by that point in my career: I couldn’t even see the part I was supposed to be playing. I’d gone from a place of tremendous possibility and confidence when I was very young, to not even **being able to see myself**.”
吴珊卓现在主演网?热?剧情片《椅子》她告诉我们，当她发现自己在猫鼠游戏式的暗杀惊悚片《杀死伊芙》中获得?色时，她以为只是一个重复出现的?色或配?。“我翻阅了剧本，我找不到亚裔医生或接待员之类的人物，”她回忆道。“就在那时，我的经纪人告诉我，他们希望我担任主?。演伊芙。片名中的人物。那一刻我意识到，在我以往的职业生涯中，内化的种族主义对我来说有多深:我甚至看不到我应该扮演的?色。我已经从小时候那种充满各种可能性和信心的阶段，变成了无视自己的程度。”

Shang-Chi isn’t the first **Asian protagonist** we’ve seen on a screen. But as a big-budget, big-screen Marvel superhero, he’ll be **ubiquitous**. Superheroes today are on every screen, device and platform, **visible to every demographic** in our society. Shang-Chi will **usher** in the next **cinematic phase** of the most **successful franchise** in global history. **In his wake** will come more Asian heroes
尚气并不是我们在银幕上看到的第一个亚裔主?。但作为一个大预算、大银幕的漫威超级英雄，他将无处不在。今天的超级英雄出现在每个屏幕、设备和平台上，我们社会中的任何一员都可以看到。尚气将迎来全球历史上最成功电影系列的下一个阶段。在他身后将出现更多亚裔英雄

That can mean the difference between life and death. **Throughout our history** in this country, Asian Americans have seen the **dire consequences of compliance and invisibility: exploitation, exclusion, internment**. We’re seeing them again today in the time of Covid, as the pandemic has **underscored our country’s xenophobic hostility, and unleashed a wave of violence** against the most vulnerable in our communities.
这可能意味着生死存亡的差距。纵观我们在这个国家的历史，亚裔美国人已经看到了顺从和隐形的可怕后果:剥削、排斥、拘禁营。我们今天在新冠时代再次看到了这些后果，大流行凸显了我们国家的仇外敌意，并引发了针对我们社区中最弱势群体的暴力浪潮。

A scene from Shang-Chi **perfectly captures** why this film is so important and **timely. Ambushed by thugs** on a San Francisco bus, Shang-Chi suddenly **unleashes a flurry of eye-popping combat moves**. His longtime friend Katy **does a hard double take**. “Who are you?” she demands. For her, this is **a brand-new** Shaun. For the rest of the riders on the bus, **cheering him on and snapping selfies**, this is a brand-new hero. All of them are **simply seeing him as who he really is**. Don’t we all **deserve as much**?
《尚气》中的一个场景完美地诠释了为什么这部电影如此重要和及时。在旧金山巴士上被暴徒伏击时，尚气突然爆发出一系列令人瞠目结舌的打斗动作。他的老朋友凯蒂大吃一惊。“你到底是谁?”她追问。对她来说，这是一个全新的肖恩。对于为他加油并拍合照的其他公交?乘客来说，这是一个全新的英雄。他们所有人就这样看到了真实的他。难道我们不应该得到同样的待遇吗?

Parents had complained that was **too generous** and had **been laxly enforced**, the administration said. The government said it would **step up inspections** to ensure that gaming companies were **enforcing the restrictions**.
管理部?称，家?们抱怨该举措过于宽松，而且执行不力。政府表示，它将加强检查，确保游戏公司执行这些限制。

Recently many parents have reported that **game addiction** among some youths and children is **seriously harming** their normal study, life and **mental and physical health**, Parents, it said, had demanded “further restrictions and **reductions** in the time provided for **minors** by online gaming services.”
不少家?反映，一些?少年沉迷网络游戏严重影响了正常的学习生活和身心健康，家?们要求“进一步限制、压缩向未成年人提供网络游戏服务的时段时?”。

The new rules also **reflect the government’s intensifying push** for companies to **jettison** what the Chinese Communist Party says are 
**unhealthy influences**, especially among teenagers and children.
新规定还反映出政府正在加大力度，敦促企业摒除中国共产党所说的不健康影响，尤其是在?少年和儿童当中。

Last week, the Chinese government **initiated a crackdown** on **teen celebrity worship and fan clubs**, warning that celebrities’ pursuit of online followers was **warping youths’ value**. China’s **Cyberspace Administration** on Friday **banned ranking** celebrities by popularity.
上周，中国政府发起了一项对?少年崇拜明星艺人、以及明星粉丝团进行打击的行动，并警告，名人对网络粉丝的追求扭曲了?少年的价值观。上周五，国家互联网信息办公室禁止对明星艺人进行人气排名。

Online gaming has been one of **the most vibrant and profitable** sectors of China’s internet industry, generating billions in revenue from players who **pay to take part in online quests**, wars and adventures.
网络游戏一直是中国互联网行业中最具活力、最能赚钱的部?之一， 从付费参与在线任务、战斗和冒险的玩家那里创造了数十亿的收入

In early August, the share prices of Tencent Holdings and other big Chinese video game companies **fell sharply** after a Chinese newspaper called their products “**spiritual opium**.” The article **singled out** Tencent, which owns Honor of Kings, a **hugely popular** game in China.
8月初，腾讯和中国其他大型电子游戏公司的股价大幅下跌，此前一家中国报纸称这些公司的产品为“精神鸦片”。该文特别提到了腾讯，它拥有在中国非常受欢迎的游戏《王者荣耀》

Chinese parents complained that children **constantly found new ways to sneak past the limits** on gaming hours, Many parents reported that their children had big changes **in their temper and personality** after **becoming addicted to games**, even **as if they had become another person**.”
中国父母抱怨说，孩子们总能找到新的方法来逃避游戏时间的限制。很多“家?反映，自己的孩子沉迷手机网络游戏后，脾气和性格较之前大不相同，甚至像是变了一个人一样”。

The woman, who has **been identified by** the police and her lawyers only **by her surname**, Zhou, said bosses and human resources had **shrugged off her complaints**. She eventually **resorted to screaming** about the assault in **a company cafeteria** last month.
警方和她的律师称她为周女士。周女士说，领导和人力资源部?对她的投诉置之不理。在上个月，她最终诉诸于在公司?堂大声高喊这一侵犯事件。

Ms. Zhou’s case has **caused an uproar** within the company and across China’s **tech establishment**. Alibaba fired the man accused of rape, said it would establish an anti-sexual-harassment policy and declared itself “**staunchly opposed to the ugly forced drinking culture**.” Yet former Alibaba employees say the problems **run much deeper** than the company has acknowledged.
周女士的案件在公司内部和中国科技企业中引起轩然大波。阿里巴巴解雇了这名被控强奸的男子，表示将制定反性骚扰政策，并宣称自己“旗帜鲜明地反对丑陋的酒桌文化”。然而，前阿里巴巴员工表示，问题比该公司承认的要严重得多。

Interviews with nine former employees **suggest that casual sexism is common** at Alibaba. They describe a work environment in which women are made to feel embarrassed and **belittled** during team-building and other activities that the company has incorporated in its culture, **a striking departure from the image of inclusion** Alibaba has **tried to project**.
对九名前员工的采访表明，随意的性别歧视在阿里巴巴很常?。在他们描述的工作环境中，公司将团建和其他活动融入其文化，在这些活动中，女性感到尴尬和被贬低，这与阿里巴巴试图塑造的包容性形象大相径庭。

The police investigation into Ms. Zhou’s case is continuing. Alibaba **appears to be trying to keep a lid on** discussions of the matter. 
警方对周女士案件的调查仍在继续。阿里巴巴似乎试图限制对此事的讨论。

Alibaba said **fostering a safe and supportive workplace** was its top priority. When we have **fallen short**, we **believe in taking responsibility and holding ourselves accountable**. Alibaba **made immediate changes to the way** it handles workplace culture and misconduct matters after Ms. Zhou’s case **came to light**. 
阿里巴巴表示，营造一个安全和支持性的工作场所是其首要任务。当我们没有做到时，我们会承担责任并追责。在周女士的案件曝光后，阿里巴巴立即改变了处理职场文化和不当行为问题的方式。

Many Alibaba departments use games and other **ice-breaking activities** to make co-workers **feel at ease with one another**. 
阿里巴巴的许多部?都通过游戏等破冰活动让同事们彼此熟悉。

Her team welcomed her with a game of **charades**. When she lost, she said, she was punished by being made to “fly the plane,” as her co-workers called it. **The stunt involved straddling** a male colleague as he sat in an office chair. The colleague then **lay back in the chair**, causing Ms. Qian to fall on top of him, **face first**. I realized while **carrying out the punishment** that it could be **a little perverted**
她的团队欢迎她的方式是进行一个猜谜游戏。她说，当她输了比赛时，她会受到惩罚，即同事口中的“开?机”。这个动作要求她跨坐在办公椅上的一位男同事身上。然后，同事往后躺在椅子上，导致钱女士倒在他身上，脸最先触碰到对方。 做这个惩罚我才知道就有点变态

But as the company has grown into **a behemoth** with more than a quarter-million employees, **customs** that might once have seemed playful **seem less innocent** now. 
但随着公司发展成为一个拥有逾25万名员工的庞然大物，曾经看似好玩的惯例现在似乎不那么单纯了。

Andrew Lloyd Webber’s **musical “Cinderella” made its glittering debut** in the West End after **multiple Covid-related delays**. On the subway, where masks are still mandatory, half of the riders **go barefaced**.
安德鲁・劳埃德・?伯的音乐剧《灰姑娘》在多次因新冠疫情推延后，终于在?区(West End)闪亮登场。地铁仍然强制要求乘客戴口罩，但一半的乘客都露着脸。

Some of that **equanimity may stem from the fact** that Britain’s case rate, while high, has not yet **risen anywhere near** the level that government officials predicted when they **lifted virtually all Covid restrictions** last month. And some of it may **simply reflect fatigue**, after 17 months of **baleful headlines and stifling lockdowns**.
这样的淡定态度有可能部分源于一个事实，即英国的感染率虽然很高，但远未上升到政府官员上个月预测的解除所有新冠限制措施下会达到的感染水平。还有可能是大家只是倦怠了，毕竟可怕的头条 新闻和令人窒息的封锁持续了17个月的时间。

**Epidemiologists are loath to** make specific predictions because many **were proved wrong** in July when cases **fell immediately** after “Freedom Day,” when most restrictions were lifted.
流行病学家不愿做出具体预测，因为许多人的预测在7月被证明是错误的，在“自由日”之后，大多数限制都被取消了，病例数却立即下降了。

Hospitalizations are rising, however, **as is the fatality rate**. With a backlog of patients with other illnesses, doctors say the National Health Service has **little slack** to **cope with** another **influx of** Covid victims.
然而，住院人数正在上升，死亡率也在上升。医生们表示，如果涌入新一轮新冠患者，全?医疗服务体系将几乎没有喘息的空间。

The government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, **preoccupied with the chaotic military withdrawal** from Afghanistan, has said **little about** the rising hospital numbers ― or **indeed about** the pandemic at all ― in recent weeks.
几周来，英国首相约翰逊政府的注意力被阿富汗撤军的混乱局面占据，几乎没有提及住院人数的增加――或者根本没有提及大流行。

**Relieved** that the more **gloomy predictions of spiraling** cases have not **materialized**, the government argues that its strategy has been **vindicated**, with infections manageable because of the success of its vaccination campaign.
病例飙升的悲观预测并没有成为现实，政府感到松了一口气，认为其策略已得到证实，由于疫苗接种活动取得成功，感染是可控的。

The **rollout of** the vaccine program for adults has been **incredibly impressive**, but, for children and young people it has been **frankly shambolic**
针对成人的 疫苗计划推出非常成功，但坦率地说，针对少年儿童的疫苗计划一直是混乱无序的。

**At the same time**, public **observance of measures** to **contain the spread** of the virus **seems to be slipping**, a factor that some epidemiologists said **accounted for** Britain having a higher case rate than countries like France and Spain, where infections are now falling.
与此同时，公众在遵守遏制病毒传播措施方面似乎逐渐掉以轻心，一些流行病学家表示，这一因素导致英国的病例率高于法国和?班牙等国家，这些国家的感染率目前正在下降。

For some who **objected to** Britain’s **recurring lockdowns**, the return to **normalcy** was both welcome and **overdue**. But some said the **tensions** between freedom and security could **easily resurface**.
对于一些反对英国反复封锁的人来说，恢复正常是值得欢迎的，也早该这样做了。但有些人表示，自由与安全之间的紧张关系很容易重新出现。

Other critics blame the government’s **mixed messages**, pointing to members of Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party, many of whom **abandoned their masks** when they returned to **a crowded chamber of Parliament** recently to discuss Afghanistan. The government’s **official position** is that people should **wear face coverings when confined indoors**.
其他批评者指责政府的信息矛盾，将矛头指向约翰逊的保守党成员，其中许多人最近回到拥挤的议会会议厅讨论阿富汗问题时没有戴口罩。政府的官方立场是，人们在室内时应该戴口罩。

The **intensity has gone out of** the debate, but it will come back if there is another wave, If it does come back, we’ll then be in the position that even the vaccines don’t work. What is the **exit route**? a former justice on Britain’s Supreme Court who has been **an outspoken critic** of the lockdowns.
辩论的激烈程度已减弱，但如果再出现一轮疫情，它还会卷土重来。如果疫情重来，那么我们就会陷入即使疫苗也不起作用的境地。我们有什么退路? 英国最高法院前法官始终直言不讳地批评封锁措施

**‘Reversing Gears’**: China Increasingly Rejects English  
开倒车？中国弱化英语教育

As a student at Peking University law school in 1978, Li Keqiang kept both pockets of his jacket **stuffed with handwritten paper slips**.   
1978在北大法学院读书时，李克强外套口袋里塞满了手写的纸条

It’s hard to **exaggerate** the role English has played in changing China’s social, cultural, economic and **political landscape**.  
英语在改变中国社会、文化、经济和政治面貌方面的所起的作用，怎么说都不过分

English is almost **synonymous with China’s reform and opening-up policies**, which transformed an **impoverished and hermetic** nation into the world’s **second-biggest** economy.  
英语几乎是中国改革开放政策的代名词，该政策将一个贫穷封闭的国家变成世界第二大经济体

That’s why it came as a shock to many when the education authorities in Shanghai, **the most cosmopolitan city** in the country, last month **forbade** local elementary schools to **hold final exams** on the English language.  
这就是为什么当上海这个国际化大都市教育部门禁止小学举行英语期末考试，许多人感到震惊

**Broadly**, the Chinese authorities are **easing the workloads** of schoolchildren, amid an effort to **ease the burdens** on families and parents.
总的来说，中国政府正在减轻学习任务，致力于减轻家庭和家长的负担

The president of **prestigious** Tsinghua University in Beijing **came under fire** this summer after sending each new student a Chinese language copy of Ernest Hemingway’s “The Old Man and the Sea.” He wrote in a letter that he wanted the students to **learn courage and perseverance**.   
今夏著名学府清华大学校长在给每位新生发一本《老人与海》中文版后，受到抨击。他在一封信中写道，希望学生们学会勇气和毅力

Some businesspeople **struck gold** by teaching English or offering instruction on how to take tests in the language.  
有商人靠英语辅导和提供考试指导而发了大财

English **lost some of its sheen** after the 2008 financial crisis.  
2008金融危机后，英语失去了一些光彩

As a result, China’s links to the outside world are being **severed** one by one.  
结果，中国与外部世界的联系正在被一一切断

Share prices of New Oriental, the education giant, **tanked** in July after the Beijing government announced crackdowns on **after-school tutoring services**. The Shanghai government’s announcement **drew praise** online from some **nationalistic quarters**.
在北京市政府宣布打击课外辅导机构后，新东方的股价出现暴跌。上海市政府的公告在网上受到一些民族主义团体的赞扬

The U.S. **withdrawal** from Afghanistan after a failed 20-year **nation-building exercise** has left many Americans and analysts saying, “If only we knew **back then** what we know now, we would have never **gone down** that path.”
在经历了为期20年的建国实践失败后，美国从阿富汗撤军，这让许多美国人和分析人士说，“早知如此，我们就不会走这条路了。"

And my fears can be **summed up in** just a few paragraphs: The 40 years from 1979 to 2019 were **an epoch** in U.S.-China relations. There were **many ups and downs**, but **all in all** it was an epoch of **steady economic integration** between our two countries.
我的担心可以用几段话来概括:从1979年到2019年的40年是美中关系的一个纪元。有许多起起落落，但总而言之，这是两国经济稳定 一体化的时代。

The depth of that U.S.-China integration helped to **fuel a much deeper globalization** of the world economy and **buttress four decades of relative peace** between the world’s two great powers.
美中一体化的深度有助于推动世界经济实现更深层次的全球化，并支撑了世界两个大国之间40年的相对和平。

**In short**, the relative peace and prosperity that the world  experienced in those 40 years cannot be explained **without reference to the U.S.-China bonding**.
简而言之，如果不提美中关系，就无法解释世界在这40年所经历的相对和平与繁荣。

It **lifted out of poverty** hundreds of millions of people in China, India and East Asia **while making many products much more affordable** to more American consumers.
它使中国、印度和东亚的数亿人摆脱了 贫困，同时使更多的美国消费者能够负担得起许多产品。

For the past five years, though, the United States and China **have been stumbling down a path of de-integration** and maybe toward **outright confrontation**. 
然而，过去五年里，美国和中国一直在脱离一体化的道路上跌跌撞撞，甚至可能走向彻底对抗。

These two giants **went from** doing a lot of business on the table and **occasionally** kicking each other under the table **to** doing **a lot less** business on the table and kicking each other **a lot harder** under the table ― so much harder that they are in danger of breaking the table and leaving each other **with a limp**. 
起初，这两个巨头在台面上来往密切，偶尔在台下使绊子，现在变成了在台面上生意少了，台下使绊子越来越激烈――激烈得连台面都快要打破，两败俱伤地离开

**For starters** we need to ask: **What aspects** of our competition/conflict with China are **inevitable** between a rising power and **a status quo power**, and what can be **dampened** by smart policy?
首先，我们需要问:在一个崛起的大国和一个维持现状的大国之间，我们与中国的竞争/冲突在哪些方面是不可避免的，在哪些方面可以通过明智的政策起到抑制作用?

When China sold us “**shallow goods**,” we didn’t care whether its government was **authoritarian, libertarian or vegetarian**. But when it comes to our buying China’s “deep goods,” **shared values matter** and they are not there.
当中国卖给我们“浅层商品”时，我们不在乎它的政府是威权主义、自由主义还是素食主义。但当谈到我们购买中国的“深层商品”时，共同价值观念很重要，但它们却并不存在。

if we are now going to **shift our focus** from the Middle East to an **irreversible strategy** of confronting China, we should **start by asking** three foundational questions
如果我们现在要将关注点从中东转移到对抗中国的不可逆转的战略上，我们应该先问三个基本问题

Are we sure we understand **the dynamics of an immense and changing society** like China well enough to decide that its inevitable mission is the global spread of authoritarianism? Especially when this will require **a generational adversarial commitment** on the part of the United States, **engendering** in turn a **still more** nationalistic China?
中国社会巨大且不断变化，我们是否对其动态有真正足够的了解，就决定说在全球传播威权主义是它不可避免的使命?尤其是当它需要美国将反对的决心代际传递下去，反过来又会导致一个更加民族主义的中国?

Because without that, any **coalition will crumble**.
因为做不到这一点的话，任何联盟都会瓦解

When we make it the world **versus** China on what are the best and most just **international norms**, we isolate **the hard-liners** in Beijing and ***leverage** more Chinese reformers on our side.
当我们让世界与中国在何为最好和最公正的国际规范对立时，我们就可以孤立北京的强硬派，并让中国更多的改革派站在我们这边。

But China will not respond just to **high-minded** talk of international norms, even if faced with a global coalition. Such talk has to be **backed up** with economic and **military clout**.
但即使面对一个全球联盟，中国也不会只对国际规范的高姿态谈话作出回应。这种谈话必须得到经济和军事影响力的支持。

It might **light a fire** under Americans to get serious about **national renewal**. But it might also light a fire to the whole U.S.-China relationship, affecting everything from supply chains to student exchanges to Chinese purchases of U.S. **government bonds**.
它也许能点燃美国人对国家复兴的激情。 但这也可能点燃整个美中关系，影响从供应链到学生交流，再到中国购买美国政府债券的方方面面。

This Sept. 11, a **diminished** president will **preside** over a diminished nation. Another Failed Presidency **at Hand**
今年的9・11到来时，一个已经降格的国家，正在由一位降格的总统掌管着。拜登，又一个即将失败的总统

We are a country that could not keep a **demagogue** from the White House; could not stop an insurrectionist mob from **storming** the Capitol; could not win (or at least avoid losing) a war against a **morally and technologically retrograde** enemy; cannot **conquer a disease** for which there are safe and effective vaccines; and cannot bring itself to trust the government, the news media, the **scientific establishment**, the police or any other institution meant to operate for **the common good**.
我们这个国家无法阻止一名煽动者进入白宫;无法阻止暴徒袭击国会大厦;无法打赢(或至少避免被打败)一场与道德和技术上都落后的敌人的战争;无法战胜疾病，即使有安全有效的疫苗;并且无法相信 政府、新闻媒体、科学机构、警察或任何其他旨在为公共利益运作的机构。

A civilization “**is born stoic and dies epicurean**,” wrote historian Will Durant about the **Babylonians**. Our civilization was born **optimistic and enlightened**, at least by the standards of the day. Now it feels as if it’s **fading into paranoid senility**.
历史学家威尔・杜兰特在谈到巴比伦人时写道，一个文明“生于坚忍，死于享乐”。我们的文明生来是乐观和开明的，至少按照当时的标准是这样。现在感觉它好像正在逐渐衰老，变得疑神疑?。

Joe Biden was supposed to be **the man of the hour**: a **calming** presence **exuding decency, moderation** and trust. As a candidate, he **sold himself as** a transitional president, a **fatherly** figure in the **mold** of George H.W. Bush who would restore **dignity and prudence** to the Oval Office after the **mendacity and chaos** that came before. It’s why I voted for him, as did so many others who once **tipped red**.
乔・拜登本应是这个时刻的主角(风云人物):从容出场，散发着正派、温和和值得信任的气质。作为候选人，他标榜自己是转型总统， 一个像乔治・H・W・布什一样的父亲般的人物，在椭圆形办公室经历了先前的谎言和混乱之后，他将恢复其尊严和审慎。这就是我投票给他的原因，就像许多其他曾经倾向共和党的人一样

Instead, Biden has become the **emblem** of the hour: **headstrong** but shaky, ambitious but **inept**. He seems to be the last person in America to realize that, whatever the **theoretical merits** of the decision to withdraw our remaining troops from Afghanistan, the military and intelligence assumptions on which it was built were **deeply flawed**, the manner in which it was executed was a national **humiliation** and a **moral betrayal**, and the timing was **catastrophic**.
相反，拜登在这个时刻却成为了这样的象征:固执但摇摆不定，雄心勃勃但无能。无论是从阿富汗撤出剩余部队的决定有什么理论价值，该决定所依据的军事和情报假设存在严重缺陷，其执行方式是对国家的羞辱和道德上的背叛，其时机是灾难性的，拜登似乎是美国最后一个意识到这些的人

The 9/11 memorial at the  World Trade Center ― water **cascading into one void**, and then  **trickling**, out of sight, into another ― has **never felt more fitting**.
在世贸中心的9・11纪念广场，水向下流入一层空洞，水流逐渐变弱、消失，淌入另一层空洞，这样的意象从未让人感到如此贴切。

That’s the **optimistic scenario**. **Alternatively**, he could suffer a legislative **calamity** like Hillary Clinton’s health care reform in 1994, which would have ended Bill Clinton’s presidency save for his **sharp swing** to the center
这是乐观的情况。或者，他可能会遭受像1994年希拉里・克林顿的医疗改革那样的立法灾难，好在比尔・克林顿急剧转向中间派

Even the optimistic **precedent** was followed by a Democratic **rout** in 2010, when the party lost 63 House seats. If history repeats itself at the 2022 midterms, I doubt that even Joe Biden’s **closest aides** think he has the **stamina** to fight his way back in 2024. Has Kamala Harris shown the political talent to **pick up the pieces**?
即使民主党有这一乐观的先例，它在2010年仍遭遇了溃败，当时该党失去了63个众议院席位。如果历史在2022年中期选举重演，我怀疑即使是乔・拜登最亲密的助手都会觉得他的精力不足以撑到在2024年重回巅峰。卡玛拉・哈里斯有没有显示出收拾残局的政治才能?

Perhaps what will save the Democrats is that Biden’s weakness will **tempt** Donald Trump to seek (and almost certainly gain) the Republican nomination
如果拜登的软弱诱使唐纳德・特朗普寻求(并且几乎肯定会获得)共和党提名，这或许能拯救民主党

There’s a **way back from this cliff’s edge**. It begins with Biden finding a way to acknowledge publicly the **gravity** of his administration’s **blunders**
现在悬崖勒马还来得及。首先，拜登需要以某种方式来公开承认其政府犯错误的严重性

He’s proud, **inflexible**, and thinks **he’s much smarter than he really is**. That’s bad news for the administration. It’s worse news for a country that **desperately needs** to avoid another failed presidency
他骄傲、固执，高估自己的智力。对政府来说， 这是个坏消息。对于一个迫切需要避免又一段失败的总统任期的国家来说，这是个更坏的消息

Impressing other writers and academics **ceased** to be my goal. Instead, I would focus on using my words to find beauty and hope.
我的目标不再是给其他作家和学者留下深刻的印象。相反，我会专注于用我的文字来寻找美丽和希望

This pandemic has left conversations and lives **cut short**.
这场大流行使谈话和生命都缩短了

And it seems to be bringing a similar **clarity** to people about their priorities: The pandemic has led to one of the largest **shifts** in jobs in recent memory, with millions of Americans making changes.
它似乎也让人们认清了什么是重要的:大流行导致了相当长一段时间里最大的劳动力市场转型之一，数百万美国人做出了改变

The pandemic has **disabused** us of the **illusion** of time as a **limitless** resource and of the false promise that the sacrifices we make for our careers are always **worth** it.
这场疫情使我们摆脱了时间是一个无穷的资源的错觉，以及我们为职业做出的牺牲总是值得的虚假承诺。

In the meantime, exercise and a **reasonable** diet was the **tithes** we paid to our fear
与此同时，锻炼和合理的饮食只是我们为恐惧付出的一小部分

For all that we know about the relatively **low mortality rates** of Covid-19 among the young, it remains something of a **deadly** lottery
尽管我们知道年轻人中Covid-19的死亡率相对较低，但它仍然是一种致命的彩票

We have had to consider our **collective** mortality. And we **are now faced with** the question of meaning. Like the **biblical psalmist** says, “We have escaped like a bird from the fowler’s snare; the **snare** has been broken, and we have escaped.” (Psalm 124:7). Covid-19 **threatened to capture** us in its snare, but **thus far** we have **eluded** it. What shall we do with this opportunity?
我们不得不考虑我们的集体死亡率。我们现在面临着意义的问题。正如圣经中的诗人所说:“我们好像雀鸟，从捕鸟人的罗网里逃脱，罗网破裂，我们就逃脱了。”(诗篇124:7)。Covid-19威胁要用它的罗网俘获我们，但到目前为止我们都躲过了它。我们要如何利用这个契机?

When we had the **illusion of time**, the lower pay, long **commutes**, high cost of  living and separation from loved ones seemed a small price to pay for a successful career. But the pandemic reminded us that there are some things more important than **vocational** progress.
当我们有时间的错觉时，较低的工资、长时间的通勤、高昂的生活成本和与亲人的分离似乎是为成功的事业付出的微不足道的代价。但疫情提醒我们，有些事情比职业发展更重要。

This was **equally true** for single friends who lived in areas where the entire social scene **catered to** married people with families.
对于一些单身朋友来说也是如此，他们住在所有社交活动都迎合有家庭的已婚人士的地区

The pandemic has reminded us that **life is more than what we do**
这场大流行病提醒我们，生活不只是我们所做的事

I **recognize** that for some, Covid-19 did not raise the same **existential** questions. 
我意识到对有些人而言，Covid-19没有引发同样关乎存在意义的问题

**Nonetheless**, I have **relatives** in service industries raising similar questions. They are **no longer willing** to deal with harassment from rude customers for a **barely livable wage**. They are **struggling to** pay their bills, but they are doing so **on their terms** with their **humanity intact**
尽管如此，我有一些在服务行业的亲戚也提出了相似的问题。他们不再愿意为了一份勉强维持生活的收入而应付粗鲁顾客的骚扰。他们正在吃力地支付账单，不过是在符合他们自己的意愿、他们的人性完好无损的条件下来做这些事。

If there is a lesson in this for employers, it is to remember that employees are **more than** workers. We have an **identity** outside the hours **committed to making a living**. Jobs that treat their employees **honorably**, provide flexibility and **leave room** for life outside of work will **thrive**
如果这些对雇主来说有什么教训的话，那就是要记住，员工不仅仅是工人。我们有一种在用于谋生的时间之外的身份。体面对待员工、提供灵活性并为工作之外的生活留出空间的工作将会蓬勃发展

I did not get to speak to my father a final time, but I did deliver the **eulogy** at his funeral. The need to **make sense of** his death revealed what was so often hard to see in the **ebb and flow** of our life together. He was like most of us, **a mass of contradictions**.
我没能和我父亲说上最后一次话，但我在他的葬礼上致了悼词。理解他的死亡这个需求，揭示了在我们共同生活的起起落落中很难看到的东西. 他和我们大多数人一样，是矛盾的集合体。

I confronted him about things he had done and the real pain he caused. It was not a **healing**, but it began something we never got to finish.
我质问他所做过的事和他造成的痛苦。这不是一种治愈，但它开始了一种我们未能完成的东西。 

When he died, I was in **the early stages** of writing what became “Reading While Black.” It has the following **dedication**: “This book **is dedicated to** the memory of Esau McCaulley Sr., who died before he ever got to see a book **bearing** our name in print. **Whatever else** I am, I will always remain your son.”
他去世的时候，我刚开始写《黑人的阅读》，它的致辞是这样的:“这本书献给依绍・麦卡利，他在看到一本印有我们名字的书之前就去世了。不论我还有什么身份，我始终是你的儿子。”

It seems that Covid-19 has **dealt a collective trauma** to the American **consciousness** and that **the full fruit of** that trauma remains uncertain. One thing is clear: Our previous normal was **not as good as we thought it was**.
Covid-19似乎对美国人的意识造成了集体性创伤，这种创伤的全部后果还不确定。有一件事是清楚无疑的:我们过去的常态并不如我们以为的那般坚固美好

Much of its dialogue is in **Mandarin**. The **cast** includes Tony Leung, one of the biggest **Chinese-speaking** movie stars in history.
大部分对白使用普通话。演员阵容包括梁朝伟，有史以来最著名的华语电影明星之一。

The studio’s first Asian superhero movie is **a hit**, **drawing praise** and ticket sales in East Asia and other global markets. 
漫威的首部亚裔超级英雄电影大获成功，在东亚和全球其他市场获得好评和票房收入

Disney, which owns Marvel, **has yet to receive clearance** from Beijing’s regulators to show the film in the vast but heavily **censored** movie market. While the reasons aren’t clear, “Shang-Chi” may be a victim of the **low point** in U.S.-China relations.
漫威的母公司迪士尼尚未获得北京监管机构的批准，无法在这个庞大但受到严格审查的电影市场放映这部电影。虽然原因尚不清楚，但《尚气》可能是美中关系低迷的受害者

China is also **pushing back against Western influence**, with increasingly vocal nationalists **denouncing** foreign books and movies and the teaching of English
中国也在抵制西方的影响，越来越多的民族主义者谴责外国书籍、电影和英语教学

But in other parts of Asia, the movie has been **greeted warmly** by audiences for how it **depicts** a Chinese superhero **burdened** by a racist back story.
但在亚洲其他地区，这部电影受到了观众的热烈欢迎，因为该片描述了一个被种族主义所累的华裔超级英雄

The movie is a **retelling** of the story of a **little-known Marvel character** created in 1973
这部电影重述了一个鲜为人知的漫威角色的故事，该角色创作于1973年

Xu Wenwu is **played** by Mr. Leung, a **legend** in Hong Kong cinema. His role in the film was **pivotal in attracting** Hong Kong audiences to the theaters, said Kevin Ma, a film industry **observer and writer** from Hong Kong.
徐文武由香港电影界的传奇人物梁朝伟饰演。来自香港的电影业观察家和作家凯文・马说，他出演这部电影，对于将香港观众吸引到影院至关重要。

To **reshape** the comic-book **character** to appeal to Asian and Asian American audiences, Marvel **put the movie in the hands** of Destin Daniel Cretton, a Japanese American director
为了重塑漫画人物以吸引亚洲和亚裔美国观众，漫威将这部电影托付给日裔美国导演德斯汀・丹尼尔・克雷顿

But for **blockbusters**, mainland China is the major market to win
但大片若想获胜，中国大陆是主要市场

Despite its absence, the film has generated **spirited debate** on the Chinese internet
虽然尚未上映，影片在中国互联网上还是引起了热议

Readers of Shang-Chi comic books in the 1970s saw Asian faces **colored** in **unnatural** oranges and yellows. They saw the main character **shirtless and shoeless**, spouting “fortune-cookie **platitudes in stilted English**,” The New York Times noted recently. And then there was Shang-Chi’s father in the comics: He was named Fu Manchu and **caricatured as a power-hungry** Asian man, an image that **harks back** to the stereotypes first pressed upon Asian immigrants a century ago.
1970年代《尚气》漫画书的读者会看到亚裔面孔呈一种不自然的橙色和黄色。他们看到主要人物赤裸上身、光着脚，滔滔不绝地“用做作的英语说着幸运饼干式的套话”，《纽约时报》近年的一篇文章注意到。漫画中还有尚气的父亲：他叫傅满洲，被描绘成一个权欲极重的亚洲男人，呼应了一个世纪前亚洲移民最早留下的刻板印象

I think countries that try to **censor** and **cover up** dissenting ideas rather than face them and deal with them are **out of touch with reality**. It’s really **immature and out of touch**.
我认为那些去审查和掩盖异议想法，而不是去面对和处理问题的国家，是跟现实脱节的。非常不成熟和不明就里

Still, the movie has found some **resonance** with Chinese audiences who have **managed to see the film**
影片在一些中国观众中还是引起了共鸣

The trouble in China may have **unintentionally** helped sales in other markets in Asia
在中国遇到的麻烦也许无意中促进了在亚洲其他市场的销量

“It’s **amusing**,” said Ms. Yang, the film producer, “that it’s Americans’ turn to read **subtitles** in a Marvel film.”
“有趣的是，”电影制片人金・杨说，“轮到美国人看漫威电影要看字幕了。”

China’s push for **self-sufficiency** in a wide range of industries is **dividing** foreign companies
中国在多个行业推动自力更生的做法正在外国企业当中带来分歧

Two **influential** groups of foreign businesses in China **issued** very different reports on Thursday. They revealed a **striking divide** on whether international companies support China’s push to replace imports with a **self-reliant** emphasis on domestic production.
周四，两个在中国有影响力的外国企业团体发表了截然不同的报告。在是否支持中国推动以强调自力更生的国内生产取代进口的努力方面，这两份报告揭示了国际企业的明显分歧

China has been **heavily subsidizing** its manufacturers of semiconductors, commercial aircraft, electric cars and other products as part of a national effort to **achieve greater self reliance**.
中国一直在大力补贴半导体、商用飞机、电动汽车和其他产品的制造商，作为加强自力更生努力的一部分

“There are **troubling signs** that China is **increasingly turning inwards**, as can be seen in its 14th **five-year plan**,” the report said, referring to an economic **blueprint** the government released this year. “This **tendency** is **casting considerable doubts** over the country’s future growth **trajectory**.”
报告称，“有令人不安的迹象表明，中国越来越向内转，这在‘十四五’规划中可以看出，”该规划指的是政府今年发布的经济蓝图。“这种趋势正在令人对该国未来的增长轨迹产生相当大的怀疑。”

More than European companies, he said, American companies **tend to** focus mainly on the next quarter’s financial results, which are usually best served by staying in China.
他说，与欧洲公司相比，美国企业往往更关注下一季度的财务业绩，而留在中国通常是更好的选择

China is **swelling** into a military superpower. India, Vietnam and Singapore are spending more on defense. Japan is **leaning to** do the same. Now Australia, backed by the United States and Britain, has **catapulted** the military contest with Beijing in Asia into a **tense new phase**.
中国正在膨胀为一个军事超级大国。印度、越南和新加坡正在增加国防开支。日本也倾向于这样做。现在，澳大利亚在美国和英国的支持下，让与中国的军事竞争在亚洲跃入了一个紧张的新阶段。

In response, China may **step up** its military **modernization**, especially in technology able to **stymie** the submarines.
作为回应，中国也许会加快本国的军事现代化，尤其是在能够阻碍核动力潜艇的技术方面

Countries trying to **stay in the middle**, like Indonesia, Malaysia and others, face a potentially more **volatile** region and growing pressure
那些试图保持中立的国家，比如印度尼西亚、马来西亚等国，面对的是一个可能更加动荡的地区

The picture is one of three **Anglo-Saxon** countries **drumming up militarily** in the Indo-Pacific region
现在的情况是，三个盎格鲁―撒克逊国家在印度―太平洋地区兜揽军事生意

India, which has **veered** between **border clashes** with China and efforts to **patch up ties** with its neighbor, has been **muted** about the agreement.
在与中国发生边界冲突和努力修补与邻国关系之间变化不定的印度尚未对澳英美协议表态

**Outwardly**, Australia’s plan to eventually build at least eight nuclear-powered **submarines** might seem to make little difference to China’s **calculus**
从表面上看，澳大利亚最终建造至少八艘核动力潜艇的计划似乎对中国的算盘没有什么影响

China Evergrande, the **property giant** whose financial **troubles roiled global markets** earlier this week, left investors in a state of **uncertainty** again on Thursday with **the fate of** an $83 million **interest** payment still **unresolved**. The payment, on Evergrande’s **dollar-denominated bonds**, was **due** Thursday
本周早些时候，房地产巨头中国恒大的财务困境搅乱了全球市场。周四，该公司8300万美元的利息支付问题仍未解决，再次让投资者陷入不确定状态。恒大这笔以美元计价的债券将于周四到期

But, this person **noted**, the company’s **debt covenants** provide it with a 30-day **grace period** before the missed payment **results in a default**, which means the **limbo** debtholders find themselves in could continue
但这位人士指出，该公司的债务契约规定，在错过付款导致违约之前，它有30天的宽限期，这意味着债券持有人的困境可能会持续存在

The **tension** in global financial markets has **eased more** recently, **in part** as Chinese officials stepped in to **shore up** confidence ― including by **pumping billions of dollars of capital into** the country’s banking system
全球金融市场的紧张最近有所缓解，部分原因是中国官员出手提振市场信心――包括向该国银行体系注入数十亿美元资金

On another key question for investors, whether China will directly **bail Evergrande out**, so far Beijing has remained **tight-lipped** while emphasizing that no Chinese company is **too big to fail**.
对于投资者面临的另一个关键问题，即中国是否会直接救助恒大，迄今为止，北京一直守口如瓶，同时强调没有一家中国企业是大到不能倒的

He said bondholders and Evergrande may ultimately **work through a near-term agreement** that involves debtholders **loosing a portion** on their Evergrande exposure
他表示，债券持有人和恒大最终可能会达成一项短期协议，其中包括让债券持有人减持部分恒大敞口

Despite the **lingering uncertainty**, stock investors seem to expect a better outcome for Evergrande than they did earlier in the week. Those businesses could still have value even if the **real-estate arm collapses**.
尽管不确定性依然存在，股票投资者似乎对恒大的预期比本周早些时候要好 即使房地产业崩溃，这些企业仍有价值。

Noel Quinn, the chief executive of HSBC, **acknowledged** at the same conference that Evergrande’s challenges might **seep further into** the **equity and credit markets**.
汇丰首席执行官诺埃尔・奎因在同一个会议上承认，恒大的挑战可能会进一步渗透到股票和信贷市场

I’d be **na?ve** to think that the **turmoil** in the market doesn’t have the potential to have **second-order and third-order impact**
如果认为市场的动荡没有可能产生二阶和三阶的影响，那就太天真了

China Evergrande Group, the developer, on Wednesday said it **reached a deal** that might give it **some breathing room** in the face of a bond payment due the next day
开发商中国恒大集团周三表示，公司已协商出一个方案，在一笔债券周四到期前获得了一些喘息空间

Heavy government spending on new rail lines, highways and other projects is keeping the economy **afloat** right now, but may not be **sustainable** through next year.
政府在新铁路、高速公路和其他项目上的巨额支出目前使经济得以维持，但这种开支可能无法持续到明年

While many economists in China are **pouring cold water** over the idea of potential **financial contagion**, they are pointing to the broad weakness in China’s property market, a **mainstay** of the economy, and other long-term threats.
尽管中国的许多经济学家给恒大可能触发金融危机的说法泼冷水，但他们也指出了中国房地产市场普遍疲软以及其他的长期威胁。房地产一直是中国经济的支柱

On Wednesday, it said in a **vaguely worded** stock market filing that it had reached an arrangement with Chinese investors to make a payment due the following day, without offering details.
公司周三在深圳股市发布的一份措辞含糊的公告中说，将在周四如期支付一笔债务的利息，支付方式与中国投资者协商解决，但没有提供细节

Chinese policymakers could **conceivably step in** and rescue Evergrande. But that would **run contrary to** their efforts to get companies to borrow less and to **take some of the steam out of** the property market, where apartments for purchase are increasingly **unaffordable** for many Chinese families in a number of markets.
中国的政策制定者可能会出面拯救恒大。但这会与他们试图让企业少借钱、给过热的房地产市场降温的努力背道而驰。不少城市的许多中国家庭越来越买不起住房。

People **familiar with** Chinese economic policymaking say that big companies often carry a lot of **collateral** on their books, so officials believe lenders won’t **get fully burned** by a collapse. They also cite the tools Beijing has to **unwind debts gradually** and limit financial disruptions, such as its control of the banking system.
熟悉中国经济决策的人士说，大公司的账簿上通常有大量抵押品，因此官员们认为，银行不会因公司破产而遭受重创。这些人士还指出，中国政府有逐步解除债务、限制金融混乱的工具，比如对银行体系的控制

**Overcapacity** in many industrial sectors, coupled with a **faltering** construction sector, have prompted economists to predict slower growth
许多工业领域产能过剩，加上建筑行业的衰退，促使经济学家做出了经济增长放缓的预测

Other questions **hovering** right now over the Chinese economy can be seen in **a handful of** measures
中国经济如今面临的其他悬而未决的问题，可以从一些数据中看到

The **nosedive** in **freight truck** production and sales is about much more than lost economic confidence, however. It also shows how China’s policies over the past few years **temporarily inflated** demand and produced **severe overcapacity**.
然而，货车产量和销售的急剧下降不仅反映了经济信心的丧失，也表明中国过去几年的政策临时推高了需求，造成了严重的产能过剩

**Stringent** new standards for air pollution took effect for freight trucks manufactured beginning July 1. Stricter safety standards are also being **phased in**, such as a requirement that **onboard** software and sensors warn drivers when they start to **drift out of** their traffic lanes.
严格的货运卡车空气污染新标准已在今年7月1日生效。更严格的安全标准也在逐步实施中，比如车载软件和传感器在司机开始偏离车道时必须发出警告。

China’s freight truck manufacturing capacity has **ballooned** to 1.6 million trucks a year in a market where long-term sales estimates are far fewer than a million trucks a year. Truck dealerships across China are now **clogged with** rows of unsold trucks.
中国货运卡车的生产能力已经膨胀到每年160万辆，而中国市场的长期销售预期远低于每年100万辆。中国各地的卡车经销商手中现在都有大量的待售卡车

An **acute** shortage of computer chips has separately affected the production and sale of cars in China, **muddying** the picture. The market for car sales is generally in a **downturn**, partly because of the chip shortage
计算机芯片的严重短缺也影响了中国汽车的生产和销售，让前景变得模糊不清 汽车销售市场比较低迷，部分由于芯片不足

While China faces broad overcapacity and other worries, many economists in China still express more confidence than economists **elsewhere** that the country can **weather its troubles**.
尽管中国面临广泛的产能过剩和其他担忧，中国的许多经济学家仍比其他国家的经济学家对中国能够度过难关更有信心

We **settled into** the now familiar contest between democratic liberalism and authoritarianism.
我们陷入了自由主义和威权主义之间的竞争，这种竞争现在人们已经很熟悉了

They used **religious symbols** as nationalist identity markers and **rallying cries**. They **unified the masses** behind them by **whipping up perpetual culture wars**. They **reframed** the global debate: it was between the **moral decadence** of Western elites and traditional values and superior spirituality of the **good normal** people in their own homelands.
他们使用宗教符号作为?族主义的身份标志和战斗口号。他们通过无休止的文化战争，将群众团结在他们身后。他们重新定义了全球辩论: 这是西方精英的道德堕落，与传统价值观以及本国善良普通人的优越精神之间的争论。

The 21st century is turning into an **era of globe-spanning holy wars** at a time when the **appeal** of actual religion seems to be **on the wane**.
在现实宗教的吸引力似乎在减弱的时候，21世纪正在变成一个跨越全球的圣战时代

Mao Zedong regarded **prerevolutionary** China **with contempt**. 
毛泽东对革命前的中国不屑一顾

Last week, the Chinese government ordered a **boycott** of **“sissy pants” celebrities**. These are the **delicate-looking** male stars who display gentle **personalities** and are accused of **feminizing Chinese manhood**.
上周，中国政府下令抵制“娘炮”明星。这些?相精致的男明星表现出温柔的气质，他们被指责令中国的男子气概变得女性化

The Chinese internet is **apparently now rife with** attacks on the **decadent** “white left” ― educated American and European progressives who **champion feminism**, L.G.B.T.Q. rights **and such**.
中国互联网现在显然充斥着对颓废的“白左”的攻击―― 这个词是指受过教育的美国和欧洲进步人士，他们是女权主义和LGBTQ权利等等的倡导者。

They are **motivated by nativist** and anti-immigrant attitudes and then **latch onto** Christian symbols to separate “them” from “us.” In Germany, for example, **the far-right group** that aggressively **plays up** its Christian identity **underperforms** among voters who are actually religious.
他们受本土主义和反移?态度驱动，然后抓住基督教的象征，把“他们”和“我们”分开。例如，在德国，激进地宣扬其基督教身份的极右翼团体在真正有宗教信仰的选举中表现不佳

These **religiously cloaked** authoritarians have naturally **provoked** an anti-religious **backlash**. The **pseudo-religious** authoritarians have raised the **moral stakes**
这些披着宗教外衣的威权主义者自然激起了反宗教的反弹, 伪宗教威权主义者提高了道德风险

Those of us on the side of Western liberalism have no choice but to fight this on the spiritual and **cultural plane** as well, to show that **pluralism** is the opposite of **decadence**, but is a spiritual-rich, **practically effective** way to **lift human dignity and run a coherent society**.
这些站在自由主义一边的人别无选择，只能在精神和文化层面上与之斗争，以表明多元化是颓废的反面，它是一种精神丰富、实际有效的方式，可以提升人类尊严，并运行一个协调的社会

The war in Afghanistan wasn’t a failure. It was a **massive success** ― for those who **made a fortune off** it.
阿富汗战争不是一场失败，而是一场巨大的成功――对那些从中发财的人来说。

Consider the case of Hikmatullah Shadman, who was just a teenager when American Special Forces **rolled into** Kandahar **on the heels of** Sept. 11. They hired him as an interpreter, paying him up to $1,500 a month ― 20 times the salary of a local police officer, **according to a profile** of him in The New Yorker. By his late 20s, he owned a trucking company that supplied U.S. military bases, earning him more than $160 million.
以希克图拉・沙德曼为例。美国特种部队在 9・11事件发生后进入坎大哈时，他还只是一个十几岁的少年。据《纽约客》上一篇关于他的人物特写，特种部队雇了他来当翻译，每月付给他最高1500美元，是当地警察工资的20倍。他快30岁时已拥有一家为美国军事基地提供物资的卡车运输公司，这让他赚了逾1.6亿美元。

If a **small fry** like Shadman could **get so rich off** the war on terror, imagine how much Gul Agha Sherzai, a **big-time** warlord-turned- governor, has **raked in** since he helped the C.I.A. run the Taliban out of town
如果像沙德曼这样的小人物都能从反恐战争中赚这么一大笔钱的话， 想象一下，军阀出身的省长古尔・阿迦・谢尔扎伊这样的大人物，自帮助中央情报局把塔利班赶出城以来已经赚了多少钱

Nobody knows how much he is worth, but it is clearly hundreds of millions ― enough for him to talk about a $40,000 **shopping spree** in Germany as if he were spending **pocket change**.
没人知道他身价几何，但显然有数亿美元，多到足够让他把一次在德国的4万美元购物狂欢说得像是花口袋里的零钱似的

Look under the **hood of the “good war,”** and this is what you see. Afghanistan was supposed to be an honorable war to **neutralize** terrorists and **rescue** girls from the Taliban. It was supposed to be a war that we **woulda coulda shoulda** won, had it not been for the **distraction** of Iraq, and the hopeless corruption of the Afghan government. But let’s **get real**. Corruption wasn’t a **design flaw** in the war. It was a design feature. We didn’t **topple** the Taliban. We paid warlords **bags of** cash to do it.
这就是这场“正义战争”外表下的情况。阿富汗战争本应是一场消灭恐怖 分子、将女孩从塔利班手下解救出来的光荣战争。这本应是一场我们本会、本可、本该打赢的战争，如果不是因为我们被伊拉克分散了注意力，如果不是因为阿富汗政府腐败得无可救药。但让我们现实一点吧。腐败不是这场战争的一个设计缺陷，而是一个设计特色。我们自己没有推翻塔利班。我们花大价钱雇军阀来推翻塔利班

Westerners often **scratched their heads** at the **persistent lack of capacity** in Afghan governing institutions, but the **sophisticated** networks controlling those institutions never **intended to govern**. Their objective was **self-enrichment**. And at that task, they proved **spectacularly** successful.
西方人经常对阿富汗政府机构的持续无能苦思不得其解, 然而控制这些机构的复杂关系网从来都没打算治理国家。他们的目标是为自己敛财。在这个任务上，他们被证明取得了了不起的成功

In April 2002, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld **dictated a top-secret memo** ordering aides to **come up with** “a plan for how we are going to deal with each of these warlords ― who is going to get money from whom, on what basis, in exchange for what, what is the **quid pro quo**, etc.,” according to The Washington Post.
据《华盛顿邮报》报道，2002年4月，时任国防部?的唐纳德・拉姆斯菲尔德口授了一份绝密备忘录，要求助手提交“一份我们将如何与这些军阀打交道的计划――谁将从谁那里拿钱，以什么为依据，以什么 为交换，回报是什么，等等”。

The war proved **enormously lucrative** for many Americans and Europeans, too. Even after it **got caught bribing** officials and **systematically overbilling** taxpayers, the contracts kept coming.
事实证明，对许多美国人和欧洲人来说，阿富汗战争也是巨大的赚钱机会。即使在公司被抓到贿赂官员、系统性地让纳税人多掏腰包之后，他们的合同仍源源不断。

It’s a **bugbear** of mine that Afghan corruption is so frequently **cited as** an explanation (as well as an excuse) for Western failure in Afghanistan, Americans “**point the finger at** Afghans, **whilst ignoring** their role in both fueling and benefiting from the **patronage pump**.”
阿富汗的腐败被如此频繁地引为?方在阿富汗失败的理由(和借口)，这是一个让我很头疼的问题. 美国人“指责阿富汗人，却忽视了他们在这个互惠互利链中既提供资金、又从中受益的角色”。

The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit that has been tracking spending in a series of reports called the **Windfalls of War**.
非营利组织“公共诚信中心”一直在跟踪支出情况，在一系列报告中称之为战争暴利(战争财)

What **stands out** about the war in Afghanistan is the way that it became the Afghan economy. At least Iraq had oil. In Afghanistan, the war **dwarfed** every other economic activity, **apart from** the opium trade.
阿富汗战争的特别之处在于它是如何成为阿富汗经济的。伊拉克至少有石油。在阿富汗，除了鸦片贸易外，战争使所有其他经济活动相形见绌。

But **alas**, policymakers in Washington **rushed to** push cash out the door, since money spent was one of the few **measurable metrics** of success.
但遗憾的是，华盛顿的政策制定者急于把钱花出去，因为所花的钱是少数几个可衡量成功的指标之一。

The money **was meant to** buy security, bridges and power plants to **win “hearts and minds.”** But the **surreal** amounts of cash **poisoned** the country instead, **embittering** those who didn’t have access to it, and **setting off rivalries** between those who did.
这笔钱本来是用于安全、桥梁和发电厂，以赢得“民心”。但超现实的现金数额反而毒害了这个国家，让那些无法拿到这些钱的人感到愤怒，并在拿到这些钱的人之间引发了竞争。

It would take years for the United States to realize that it was fueling corruption with its **excessive** spending and lack of **oversight**. The result was a fantasy economy that operated more like a casino or a **Ponzi scheme** than a country. Why build a factory or **plant crops** when you can get **fabulously wealthy** selling whatever the Americans want to buy?
美国需要数年时间才能意识到，其过度支出和缺乏监督正在助长腐败。结果是产生了一个幻想中的经济体，其运作更像是一个赌场或庞氏骗局，而不是一个国家。如果出售美国人想要的东西就可以变得超级富有，为什么还要建造工厂或种植农作物?

The money fueled the **revolving door** of war, **enriching the very militants** that it was meant to fight, whose attacks then **justified a new round of** spending.
这笔钱推动了战争的旋转门，使得原本要打击的武装分子变得富有，然后他们的袭击又为新一轮的支出提供了理由。

Social scientists have a name for countries that are so **reliant on unearned income** from outsiders: “rentier states.” It is usually used for **oil-producing countries**, but Afghanistan now **stands out** as an extreme example.
社会科学家对如此依赖外来者非劳动收入的国家起了一个名字:出租者国家。这个名字通常用于产油国家，但阿富汗现在是一个极端的例子。

I knew the war in Afghanistan had **gone off the rails** the day I had lunch in Kabul with a European consultant who **got paid a lot of money** to write reports about Afghan corruption. He’d just arrived, but he already had a lot of ideas about what needed to be done ― including **ridding** the Afghan Civil Service of **pay scales based on seniority**. 
在喀布尔与一位欧洲顾问共进午餐的那天，我就知道阿富汗战争已经脱离正轨，这位顾问获得了很多报酬，用于撰写有关阿富汗腐败的报道. 他刚到那里，但他已经对需要做的事情有了很多想法――包括让阿富汗公务员摆脱基于资历的薪酬等级。

**None of this is to say that** the Afghan people don’t **deserve support**, even now. They do. But **far more** can be achieved by spending **far less** in a more **thoughtful way**.
这并不是说阿富汗人不值得支持，即使是现在。他们确实值得。但是，通过更为深思熟虑的方式，花费更少的钱可以实现更多的目标。

What does the Taliban takeover say about the war? It proves that you cannot buy an army. You can only rent one **for awhile**. Once the money **spigot** turned off, how many **stuck around to** fight for our vision of Afghanistan? 
塔利班的接管对战争来说意味着什么? 它证明了你无法购买一支军队。你只能租用一段时间。一旦资金龙头关掉，有多少人坚持为我们的阿富汗愿景而战?

When I moved to Washington, D.C., in 2002 we all **lived in 9/11’s shadow**. We waited for bombs in the Metro, for more **anthrax** envelopes, for a **sequel** to the previous autumn’s terror. We watched planes headed for Reagan Airport fly low over the Potomac, always **half-expecting** them to **veer**. Everything in my profession **revolved around** the War on Terror. 
我在2002年搬到华盛顿特区时，大家都生活在9・11的阴影下。我们担心地铁里有炸弹，担心出现更多含有炭疽的信封，担心前一年秋天的恐怖事件出现续集。看到飞往里根机场的飞机在波托麦克河上低空飞行时，我们总是担心它们会突然转向。我职业中的一切都围绕着反恐战争。

Nightly in our **unkempt** apartments he argued with the hawks ― **which is to say** with all of us ― **channeling** the realist foreign policy thinkers he admired, predicting **quagmire**, destabilization and defeat.
每晚在我们凌乱的公寓里，他与鹰派――也就是与我们所有人――争论他所钦佩的现实主义外交政策思想家，预言困境、不稳定和失败。

**In almost every way** the rest of the post-9/11 era **vindicated** his arguments ― not just in the Iraq war but also in our **chaos-sowing** Libya intervention and our failed attempt at nation-building in Afghanistan.
在后9・11时代的其余时间里，他的论点几乎在所有方面都得到了验证――不仅是在伊拉克战争中，也在我们制造了混乱的利比亚干预以及在阿富汗建国的失败尝试中。

Even in 2015, it was still **potent** enough that Colby was **reportedly blackballed** from a job as foreign policy director for Jeb Bush’s campaign, because of his **insufficient enthusiasm** about a potential conflict with Iran.
即使到了2015年，鹰派氛围依旧十分浓厚,据说科尔比曾因缺乏对伊朗潜在冲突的兴趣，而被拒绝担任杰布・布什竞选活动的外交政策主任。

A **consensus** can change slowly and then, under the right pressure, **all at once**, and for Republicans that pressure came from Donald Trump. No **dove or systematizer**, he still made **realism and anti-interventionism respectable** again ― with **immediate consequences** for my friend.
共识可以慢慢改变，然后在适当的压力下骤变，对于共和党人来说，这个压力来自唐纳德・特朗普。他不是鸽派或系统主义者，但仍使现实主义和反干预主义再次受到尊重――这对我的朋友产生了直接的影响。

As the **title suggests**, this is a **realist’s** book, **laser-focused** on China’s **bid for mastery** in Asia
正如书名所暗示的那样，这是一本现实主义者的书，重点关注中国征服亚洲的努力

Only China **threatens** American interests in a **profound** way, through a **consolidation** of economic power in Asia that **imperils** our **prosperity** and a military defeat that could **shatter** our alliance system. 
只有中国能够以一种深刻的方式威胁到美国的利益――通过巩固在亚洲的经济实力危及我们的繁荣，以及一场可能破坏我们联盟体系的军事胜利。

“The Strategy of **Denial**” presents a **particularly unsentimental** version of what a lot of people bidding to shape a post-9/11-era foreign policy believe
《否定策略》展示了一个完全不带感情色彩的版本，反映了许多力图塑造后9・11时代外交政策的人所相信的那样

But this is **a long way from** being any kind of consensus. The **establishment freak-out** over Biden’s Afghan **withdrawal indicates** the **extent** to which a focused, China-first foreign policy seems like **retreat** to Democrats and Republicans **accustomed to** more global and **unlimited** ambitions.
而这离达成任何程度的共识还有很?的路要走。拜登从阿富汗撤军引发的权势集团的恐慌表明，对于更加习惯于无休止的全球性野心的?主党人和共和党人来说，目标明确、中国优先的外交政策在很大程度上似乎是一种退缩。

**Meanwhile**, a very different group of **post-9/11-era thinkers** regards China **hawkishness** as a **dangerously self-fulfilling prophecy** ― a way to **blunder** into an unnecessary and **disastrous** war.
与此同时，一群截然不同的后9・11时代的思想家将对华鹰派立场视为一种危险的自我实现预言――一种失策，这将导致一场不必要的灾难性战争

Rather than the old **establishment’s maximalism**, they prefer minimalism, an end even to the light-footprint forms of warcraft attacked by Samuel Moyn of Yale in his new book “**Humane**” ― an interesting **accompaniment and counterpoint** to Colby’s ― and a **deliberate retreat** from empire. (The idea that climate change requires **conciliation with** China also **looms** large for some in this group.)
与旧建制派的最大化主义相比，他们更喜欢极简主义，甚至是终止耶鲁大学的塞缪尔・莫恩在其新作《人道》中所抨击的 “轻足迹”形式的战争――这本书站在科尔比著作的对立面，两本书搭配起来阅读很有趣――以及有意的退让。(气候变化需要与中国和解的想法对这一群体中的一些人来说也很重要。)

The minimalist group has the **least influence** in Washington, but its **skepticism** about warmaking has a lot of popular support ― including skepticism about war with China. 
这个极简主义团体在华盛顿的影响力最小，但它对战争的怀疑得到了很多?众的支持――包括对与中国开战的怀疑。

But Beijing’s own choices will also **shape our strategy**. A China that retreats **somewhat**, post-Covid, from **bellicosity** and border **skirmishes** would **defang** the China-hawk argument **quite a bit**.
但北京自己的选择也将影响我们的战略。在新冠后时代，一个减少好斗和边境小规模冲突的中国将在很大程度上否定对华鹰派的论点。

**On the other hand**, a China that looks at American **disarray** and its own **window of opportunity** and decides to move **aggressively** could leave my old friend in the same place the 9/11 era left his younger self ― with his strategic analysis **vindicated, unhappily**, by an American defeat.
另一方面，如果中国看到了美国的混乱和自己的机会窗口，并决定积极采取行动，这可能会让我的老朋友再次经历他年轻时候在9・11时代所经历的――他的战略分析不幸被美国的失败所证实。

**Yet despite his assurances**, General Milley was so **concerned** about Mr. Trump that later that day he **convened a meeting** with top commanders to remind them that the procedures for launching a nuclear weapon **called for** his involvement in such a decision.
然而，尽管做出了保证，米利还是非常担心特朗普，以至于当天晚些时候，他召集了一次高级指挥官会议，提醒他们发射核武器的程序规定了决策需要有他的参与。

The book also **reveals** how Vice President Mike Pence **struggled** more than was **publicly known** over how to **navigate** Mr. Trump’s demands that he **upend** the election certification. 
这本书还揭示出，在应对特朗普要求他推翻大选结果认证的问题上，副总统迈克・彭斯其实比公众知道的要更勉强。

Mr. Pence **appeared open** to **going along with** Mr. Trump’s plan, pushed the **false claim** that Arizona’s voting results were wrong and asked whether there was any way he could delay certification.
彭斯似乎对支持特朗普的计划持开放态度，他提出了亚利桑那州投票结果有问题的不实说法，并询问是否有任何方法可以推迟认证。

“**Peril**,” which is **scheduled to be released** next Tuesday, says its **accounts** are based on **contemporaneous** notes, documents and interviews with **unnamed firsthand** participants and witnesses. 
定于下周二发行的《危险》称，其叙述是基于当时的笔记、文件以及对未透露姓名的直接参与者和目击者的采访。

**Top aides** ― including General Milley, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Attorney General William P. Barr ― became **convinced** that they needed to take **drastic measures** to stop him from **trampling on** American democracy or **setting off** an international conflict, and General Milley thought that Mr. Trump had **declined mentally** in the **aftermath** of the election, according to the book.
根据这本书，包括米利、国防部??克・T・埃斯珀和司法部?威廉・P・巴尔在内的高级助手们确信，他们需要采取激烈措施，以阻止特朗普践踏美国?主或引发国际冲突，米利认为大选之后的特朗普已经出现心智上的衰颓。

**A little less than half** of the book also covers the first several months of Joseph R. Biden’s administration, as the new president **grappled with** the pandemic, a **faltering** economy, Congress and the military’s withdrawal from Afghanistan.
这本书有将近一半的篇幅涵盖了拜登政府的前几个月，讲述这位新总统如何努力应对疫情、经济衰退、国会和从阿富汗撤军等问题。

But it is the book’s details about the Trump administration that are **likely to garner** the most attention.
但这本书中关于特朗普政府的细节可能会获得最多的关注。

Despite General Milley’s **reassurances**, he **feared** that Mr. Trump might be trying to find a moment that he could **seize on** to remain in power, similar to Hitler’s **exploitation** in 1933 of an **arson fire** at the German Reichstag to help **institute emergency powers**, the book said.
该书称，尽管米利做出了保证，但李作成担心特朗普可能会试图找到一个时机，通过抓住这个时机继续掌权，就像希特勒在1933年利用德国国会大厦纵火案来掌握非常时期的权力一样。

But even after the call, General Milley concluded that the situation was “**grave**” and General Li “remained **unusually rattled**,” the book reports. Mr. Trump, General Milley had concluded, did not want a war but might order the launch of **some sort of** military strike that would **set off a chain reaction** and lead to war.
而书中写道，即便在那次通话后，米利认为形势“严峻”，李作成仍然 “异常紧张”。米利得出的结论是，特朗普不想发动战争，但可能会下令进行某种军事打击，从而引发连锁反应，并导致战争。

Later that day, General Milley spoke to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was growing **increasingly concerned** Mr. Trump would **lash out** and use military force. “This is bad, but who knows what he might do?” Ms. Pelosi said. “He’s crazy. You know he’s crazy. He’s been crazy for a long time. So don’t say you don’t know **what his state of mind is**.” “Madam **Speaker**,” General Milley said, “I agree with you on everything.”
当天晚些时候，米利与南希・佩洛?议?进行了交谈，佩洛?愈发担心特朗普会大肆发泄并动用武力。“这太糟糕了，但谁知道他会做什么呢?”佩洛?说。“他疯了。你知道他疯了。他已经疯了很久了。所以不要说你不清楚他的心理状况。” “议?女士，”米利说。“您说的这些我都同意。”

The general added: “The strict procedures are **explicitly** designed to avoid **inadvertent** mistakes or accident or **nefarious, unintentional, illegal, immoral, unethical** launching of the world’s most dangerous weapons.”
他还说:“严格的程序旨在避免因疏忽出现错误或意外，或是对世界上最危险的武器进行邪恶的、无意的、非法的、不道德的发射。”

**While** much had been reported about General Milley’s views of Mr. Trump, the book’s **depiction** of Mr. Pence revealed for the first time the depths that the vice president went to as his **fealty** to Mr. Trump **collided with** calculations about his political future and the counsel of his aides and advisers to follow the Constitution.
尽管有大量笔墨描述了米利对特朗普的看法，书中对彭斯的描写则首次揭露了在对特朗普的忠诚与对政治前途的盘算、以及其助手和顾问对遵守宪法的建议之间出现冲突之时，这位副总统可以做到何种程度。

‘It’s a **Godsend**’: 9-Cent Taxi Rides in **Rural** South Korea
“天上掉下来的好事”:改变韩国农村的“百元出租?”

On a recent **overcast** morning, a village on South Korea’s west coast showed no sign of human **stirring** until five older residents slowly emerged through the fog that **shrouded lush**, green rice **paddies**.
不久前一个天色阴沉的早晨，在韩国?海岸一个村庄，雾气笼罩着郁郁葱葱的稻田，没有行人走动的迹象，直到五位年?的居?慢慢地从雾中出现。

As its population declined, **so did the number of bus passengers**, which led to unprofitable **routes** being canceled. Then bus drivers **went on strike**.
随着人口减少，公交?乘客的数量也减少了，导致不盈利的路线被取消。然后公共汽?司机开始罢工。 

“The taxi now drives me all the way to my **doorstep**,” Ms. Na said. “You can’t imagine what it was like in older days when I had to **haul** my shopping bag all the way from the bus stop to my place. It **killed my legs**, but there is no one around here to help old folks like me.”
“现在出租?会一路载我到家?口，”罗正顺说。“你根本想不到以前我得把购物袋从?站一路拖到家的样子。我的腿都要断了，但这附近没有人来帮助我这样的老人。”

For years, South Korea has reported one of the lowest **birthrates** in the world, creating a **fast-aging** population and causing **strains** in all **aspects of society** from its welfare budget to public transportation to schools.
多年来，韩国一直是世界上出生率最低的国家之一，造成人口快速老龄化，并给社会各个方面带来压力――从福利预算到公共交通再到学校。

The impact of the **demographic** shift is the most **visible** in thousands of rural villages whose young people, including Ms. Na’s children, have left for big cities for **better-paying jobs**. 
人口结构变化的影响在成千上万的农村地区表现得最为明显，那里的年轻人，包括罗正顺的孩子们，都已经离开家乡到大城市去寻找收入更高的工作。

Government officials say supporting the 100-won taxi services is **far more cost-effective than deploying subsidized buses** to the tiny **hamlets tucked** between mountains where few people other than **arthritic**, retired farmers live ― and building wider roads to **accommodate** those buses.
政府官员表示，支持百元出租?服务远比向隐藏在山间的小村庄部署提供补贴的公共汽?更具成本效益，那里除了退休、患有关节炎的农?之外，很少有人居住，而且还要修建更宽的道路来容纳这些公共汽?。

She sees her village of 12 houses, three of them empty, **decay day by day**. "When it rained the other night, I heard part of an empty house next door **caving in**." said Ms. Park, whose own home was **well-kept**, with farm gear **hanging neatly** on a wall and **zinnias blossoming** outside her gate. “We feel more isolated as the pandemic made it more difficult for our children to visit.”
她看着村子里的12栋房子一天天衰败，其中三栋是空的。那天晚上下雨的时候，我听到隔壁一栋空房子的一部分塌了. 朴景洙说。她自己的房子保养得很好，农具整?地挂在墙上，?外百日菊开了。疫情让孩子们更难来看望我们，我们觉得更孤立了。

**In addition to** picking up groceries and seeing their doctors, they exchange news with **acquaintances** from other villagers, like who was taken to a nursing home and who died.
除了买东?和看病，他们还跟其他村子的熟人交流消息，比如谁被送进了疗养院，谁去世了。

Seocheon **boasts** two UNESCO **World Heritage** attractions ― a centuries-old practice of **weaving fine fabric** from ramie plants, and its **tidal flats teeming with marine life**. 
舒川拥有两个联合国教科文组织世界遗产――有着数百年历史的r麻纺织，以及海洋生物遍布的潮滩。

During the **bird-migrating seasons**, tourists from across South Korea drive to Seocheon to watch **flocks of** longbills, mallards and **honking** swans **feeding on its tidal flats** before flying onto Siberia.
在?类迁徙季节，来自韩国各地的游客驱?前往舒川，观看成群的弯嘴吸蜜?、野鸭和鸣叫的天鹅在?往?伯利亚前在潮滩上觅?。

But the county didn’t escape the **upheaval** that South Korea’s rapid **industrialization wrought** on its rural towns. Its ramie fabric industry declined, with most of South Korea’s clothes now imported or made of **synthetic materials**. People drink more **imported wine** and beer than sogokju.
但该郡并没有逃脱韩国快速工业化给农村城镇带来的剧变。由于韩国的大部分服装现在依靠进口或由合成材料制成，苎麻面料产业衰落。

Seocheon, the county seat, **has all the looks of** a fast-aging community. During a recent market day, its orthopedic and other medical **clinics** were **jammed with** elderly patients.
舒川城拥有快速老龄化社区的所有特征。在最近的一个赶集日，其?科和其他医疗诊所里挤满了老年患者。

At the nearby bus and taxi stop, **stooped**, older passengers with **shopping bundles** sat under **an awning** like a row of birds, waiting for 
their buses or 100-won taxis to **show up**. 
在附近的公交?站和出租?站，提着购物袋的年?乘客驼着背，像一排小?一样坐在遮阳篷下，等待他们的公交?或百元出租?。郡政府安排的一名身穿?色背心的年轻助理正忙着在他们上下?时帮忙提购物袋。

It was **especially difficult** for old people to walk to the nearest bus stop when it **snowed** in winter or was **scorching** hot in summer
在下雪的冬天或 炎热的夏季，老人步行到最近的公交?站尤其困难。

On a recent day, she was **all smiles** as she carried a shopping bag full of fish and **crabs** from the market. She had even **treated** herself to **a new pair of pants**.
最近的一天，她笑容满面地提着一个装满从市场买来的?和螃蟹的购物袋。她还给自己买了一条新裤子。

The announcement by China, which is **by far** the biggest **domestic** producer of coal and the largest financier of **coal-fired** power plants around the world, was **cautiously welcomed** by experts.
作为迄今为止最大的国内煤炭生产国和全球最大的燃煤电厂融资国，中国的这一声明受到了专家的谨慎欢迎。

China is the **undisputed** king of coal. Last year, China built **more than three times more** new coal power capacity than all other countries in the world **combined, equal to** “more than one large coal plant per week,” China’s **net** construction of coal power capacity within the country **grew by** 29.8 gigawatts, **essentially wiping out the gains** of the rest of the world.
中国是无可争议的煤炭之王。去年中国新建的煤炭装机容量是世界上所有其他国家总和的三倍多，相当于“每周新建一座以上的大型燃煤电厂”。中国国内煤电装机容量净建设增加了29.8吉瓦，基本上抵消了世界其他地区煤电净装机容量减少的成果

How much energy is **in a gigawatt**? It is **enough to power** 750,000 homes or 110 million LED **light bulbs**.
一吉瓦有多少能量? 它足以为75万个家庭或1.1亿个LED灯泡供电

Is China **abandoning** coal? Not just yet. **Domestically**, China produces about 1,200 gigawatts of energy from coal, according to Greenpeace China.
中国正在放弃煤炭吗?还没有。根据绿色和平中国的数据，在国内，中国通过燃煤生产约1200吉瓦的能源

For some **host countries**, partnering with China is the only way to draw energy from their own supply of coal. That is because China has an **abundance of** money, the **steel mills** that are needed to make coal power plants and the **engineering expertise** that many other countries don’t have.
对一些东道国来说，与中国合作是从本国煤炭供应中获取能源的唯一途径。因为中国拥有大量资金、制造煤电厂所需的钢厂，以及许多其他国家不具备的工程专业知识。

South Korea and Japan have been the two largest supporters of coal-fired power plants **abroad after China**. **In light of that**, China’s role in **financing** power plants **overseas** “was only going to grow,”
韩国和日本是除中国之外海外燃煤电厂的最大支持者. 有鉴于此，中国在海外发电厂融资方面的作用“只会越来越大”。

Plans to build coal power plants have also been **shelved** (South Africa), **reconsidered** (Bangladesh) and faced funding troubles (Vietnam).
在其他地区，建设燃煤电厂的计划也被搁置(南非)、重新考虑(孟加拉国)或面临资金问题(越南)。

The statement did not **make clear** whether the **moratorium** on “building” **meant no more financing**, or if the new policy would apply to projects that have already been proposed, approved or are **under construction**. He would like to have more **clarity** on these issues in the coming weeks.
声明没有说明暂停“建设”是否意味着不再融资，或者新政策是否适用于已经提出、批准或在建的项目。他希望在未来几周内对这些问题能有更清楚的了解。

Unfortunately, President Donald Trump **promptly tore it up** rather than learn what it was about and get Congress to **ratify** it, and the Democrats have **since then** made no move to **revive the deal**, known as the TPP.
不幸的是，特朗普总统没有去了解它的用意、让国会批准它，反而迅速撕毁了它，此后，?主党人没有采取任何行动来恢复这项被称为TPP的协议。

If you want to be part of this **American-crafted** 21st-century **trade pact**, you have to **play by our rules**. That’s why reformers in China were **intrigued** by the TPP ― they saw it as **a lever** to open the Chinese system ― and **hard-liners** feared it more than **submarines**.
如果你想成为这个由美国制定的21世纪贸易协定的一部分，你就必须遵守我们的规则。正因如此，中国的改革者对TPP感兴趣――他们把它视为撬开中国体制的杠杆――而强硬派对它的恐惧超过了潜艇。

While China’s **admittance** is not likely anytime soon (it requires **unanimous consent** of the members), just by applying Beijing is exposing how **unserious** the American **far left and far right** are when it comes to China. They **rail against** Beijing’s human rights policy and then they block one of America’s most effective tools to **nudge** ― and that is **the most we can ever do** ― China toward more transparency and the **rule of law**, i.e., TPP.
虽然中国不太可能在短时间内加入(这需要成员国的一致同意)，但仅仅通过这次申请，北京就暴露了美国的极左和极右在中国问题上有多不正经。他们抱怨北京的人权政策，然后又阻止美国最有效的工具之一(也是我们能做的最大努力)――也就是TPP――推动中国走向更透明和法治。

What makes this Chinese **maneuver** more **ridiculous** is that Trump was so **ignorant about** the contents of the TPP before he **tore it up** ― his main objection was **surely** that Obama had **negotiated it**
让中国这一步棋显得愈发荒诞的是，特朗普在撕毁TPP之前对其内容一无所知――他的主要反对理由肯定是，这个协议是由奥巴?谈判达成的 

But Trump’s **foolishness** had a lot of **tacit** support from Bernie Sanders and his fellow progressives with their **knee-jerk opposition** to the pact 
但特朗普的愚蠢在相当程度上得到了伯尼・桑德斯和他的进步派伙伴们的默许，他们下意识地反对这项协议

One of the largest **multilateral** trade agreements ever negotiated, it included restrictions on foreign state-owned enterprises that **dumped subsidized products** into our markets. It **set out explicit anti-human-trafficking provisions** that prohibited turning **guest workers** into slave labor. It required **signatories** to permit their workers to form independent trade unions to **collectively bargain** and to **eliminate** all child labor practices.
这是有史以来最大的多边贸易协议之一，其中包括限制向我国市场倾销补贴产品的外国国有企业。协议中有明确的反人口贩运条款，禁止奴役外来劳工。它要求缔约国允许工人组建独立的行业工会进行集体议价，并消除一切童工。

By **accounting for** 40 percent of global G.D.P., the original TPP would have become a real **standards-setter** in the Pacific.
TPP原始缔约国将占据全球GDP的40%，使其成为太平洋地区名副其实的标准制定者。

**precisely** because they wanted us in the neighborhood as a bigger economic **counterweight** to China’s growing domination. And then we **walked away**, and now China wants to take our place ― **on its terms**.
这恰恰是因为这些国家希望我们能在这一地区成为更大的经济力量以制约中国日益增强的统治地位。结果我们就这么走开了，如今中国希望取代我们的位置――并且要按他们的方式。

A new book reports that Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of **the Joint Chiefs of Staff, improperly restricted** the president of the United States’ ability to use military force and **committed to warning** China, an American **adversary**, of any **impending** U.S. military action against it. The context **surrounding** General Milley’s actions is unclear and may be **exculpating**. 
根据一本新书的报道，参谋?联席会议主席?克・米利对美国总统使用军事力量的能力进行了不恰当的限制，并提醒美国的对手中国注意美国对其即将采取的行动。米利这些行为所处的情境目前尚不得而知，这种具体情境也许能让他脱罪。

There are other potential explanations for General Milley’s actions **less salacious** than the Woodward and Costa **telling accounts for**. But the problem **runs deeper than** the specifics of General Milley’s actions and **signals trouble** for the relationship between our military and the civilians it is **intended to serve**.
对于米利的行为，还有其他可能的解释，而不像伍德沃德和科斯塔所说的那样不光彩。但这是一个比米利的具体行为更深层次的问题，预示着我们的军人与其旨在服务的平?之间的关系出现了问题。

Though the president is commander in chief, Congress also provides **civilian control** of the military and requires all two-star generals and above to commit to informing **it of concerns** they have about **executive branch** actions. So General Milley discussing the president’s **soundness** with the speaker of the House, **while unseemly**, could be understood as fulfilling his **constitutional responsibilities**.
尽管总统是总司令，但国会也对军队拥有文官控制权，并要求所有两星及以上的将军承诺向其通报他们对行政部?行动的担忧。因此，米利与众议院议?讨论总统的身心健全性，虽然不太体面，却可以理解为他在履行他的宪法责任。

Whether that’s **indicative** of a **clandestine** move by the chairman or simply the **routine dysfunction** of an administration that wasn’t well managed is difficult to **assess**. We may never **find out the full story**: It’s **unlikely** that General Milley or other military leaders would **publicly rebut the account**, since that would **draw them further into the glare of** civilian politics.
很难评估这是参联会主席的秘密举动，还是仅仅是管理不善的政府的日常运转失灵。我们可能永远无法了解到事情的全貌:米利或其他军事领导人不太可能公开反驳这个说法，因为这会使他们进一步受到文官政治的注目。

But even if the Woodward and Costa account **sensationalizes** General Milley’s actions, his choices are **problematic** for civil-military relations. **Account after account of** the Trump administration is **rife** with General Milley’s friends and colleagues describing his conversations and **ascribing the noblest of** motives to him. Either General Milley has the most **indiscreet circle of acquaintances** in Washington or he’s authorizing it to **reshape his image**.
但即使伍德沃德和科斯塔的说法过于夸张，米利的选择对军政关系来说也是有问题的。在诸多关于特朗普政府的陈述中，充斥着米利的朋友和同事对他所说的话的描述，并将之冠以最高尚的动机。要么米利在华盛顿的交往圈子格外口无遮拦，要么这一切是得到他授意的，旨在重塑他的形象。

One can **sympathize with** the general’s **frustration of having** as his legacy the image of him **striding through** Lafayette Square in combat **fatigues alongside** a president who is **threatening to** use the military against American citizens and still think it’s **unbecoming** for the president’s senior military adviser to be so actively working to **cast himself as the savior** of the Republic. Nor is the problem just **optics**.
可以理解将军的烦恼，因为他留给大家的印象是，身着作战服与一位威胁要对美国公?动用军队的总统一起走过拉斐特广场，但同时我们也需要知道，作为总统的高级军事顾问，主动把自己塑造成共和国的拯救者是不合适的。而且也不只是形象的问题。

Some argue that military leaders **interposing** themselves between the president and a **politically motivated war** is **the least bad choice**. Even in the extreme circumstances of a **wildly erratic** president attempting to use the military to prevent the transfer of power, it’s dangerous to have military leaders **subvert civilian control** of the military in the way a chairman of the Joint Chiefs “pulling a Schlesinger” implies. An **unsound** president is a danger to democracy, but a military that considers itself the **arbiter** of elected leaders’ lawful authorities is also a danger to democracy.
一些人认为，由军事领导人出面阻挠总统发动出于政治动机的战争，属于最不坏的一个选择。即使在最极端的情况下，一个极其不稳定的总统试图利用军队阻止权力交接，参谋?联席会议主席“效法施莱辛格” 也意味着军事领导人颠覆文官对军队的控制，因而是危险的。身心有恙的总统对?主构成威胁，但如果军队认为自己是?选领导人合法权力的仲裁者，也将对?主构成威胁。

America’s **uniformed leaders** did an outstanding job ensuring that our military **kept out of** politics during and after a **contested election**. They deserve **enormous credit** for that **professionalism** and service to the nation. They’d deserve even more credit if they’d stop **publicizing** it.
美国的军方领导做了出色的工作，确保我们的军队在有争议的选举期间和之后远离政治。他们的专业精神和对国家的服务值得巨大的赞誉。如果他们能不把这些公开化，得到的赞誉会更多。

When the troubled Chinese property giant Evergrande **was starved for cash** earlier this year, it turned to its own employees with a **strong- arm pitch**: Those who wanted to keep their bonuses would have to give Evergrande **a short-term loan**. Some workers **tapped** their friends and family for money to lend to the company. Evergrande suddenly stopped paying back the loans, which had **been packaged as high-interest investments**.
今年早些时候，陷入困境的中国房地产巨头恒大急需现金，它向自己的员工大力宣传:那些想要保留奖金的人必须向恒大提供短期贷款。一些员工向他们的朋友和家人借钱给公司。恒大突然停止偿还这些曾被包装为高息投资的贷款。

Once China’s **most prolific** property developer, Evergrande has become the country’s **most indebted** company. It **owes unfinished apartments to** home buyers and has **racked up** more than $300 billion in unpaid bills. 
恒大曾经是中国最高产的房地产开发商，现在已经成为中国负债最多的公司。它还欠购房者未完工的公寓，并累积了超过3000亿美元的未付账单。

Evergrande is **on the hook** to buyers for nearly 1.6 million apartments, according to one estimate, and it may owe money to tens of thousands of its workers.
据一项估计，恒大需要向购房者交付160万套公寓，并且它可能欠数万名员工的钱。

As rumors **rippled through** the Chinese internet that Evergrande might **go bankrupt** this month, Mr. Jin and some of his colleagues gathered in front of **provincial government offices** to **pressure** the authorities to **step in**.
随着中国互联网传出恒大可能在本月破产的流言，金成和他的一些同事聚集在省政府办公室前，向当局施压，要求当局介入。

In the southern city of Shenzhen, home buyers and employees **crowded into the lobby** of Evergrande’s headquarters last week and **shouted** for their money back. “Evergrande, give back my money I **earned with blood and sweat**!” some could **be heard yelling** in **video footage**.
在南方城市深圳，购房者和员工上周涌入恒大总部的大厅高呼要求退钱，在视频片段中可以听到一些人大喊:“恒大还我血汗钱!”

Evergrande did not **respond to a request for comment**, but the company recently warned that it was **under “tremendous” financial pressure** and said it had hired **restructuring experts** to help determine its future. **Things were not always this way**.
恒大没有回应置评请求，但该公司最近警告称其面临“巨大”的财务压力，并表示已聘请重组专家来帮助明确公司的未来。曾经的恒大并非如此。

Banks and investors **happily threw in money, making a bet on** China’s growing middle class and its **appetite for** homes and other properties. **More recently**, real estate has **come under scrutiny** from Chinese regulators who want to end **the go-go years of the boom** and have forced the industry to start **paying off debt**. The idea was to **reduce Chinese banks’ exposure** to the property sector. 
银行和投资者兴高采烈地投入资金，押注中国不断壮大的中产阶级及其对住所和其他房产的需求。而最近，房地产受到中国监管机构的审查，它们希望结束繁盛时期，并强制要求该行业开始偿还债务。这一做法是为了减少中国的银行在房地产行业的?险。

The Chinese financial system is really complex and when you see **fissures** like this you realize the impact it could **possibly have on society**, If Evergrande **were to disappear** tomorrow, it could be **a socially systemic issue**
中国的金融体系着实复杂，当你看到这样的裂隙时，你就会想到它可能对社会产生的影响，如果明天恒大就消失了，那可能会成为一个社会系统问题

Evergrande has tried to **sell off parts of its vast empire** to raise new funds, but said last week it was “**uncertain as to** whether the group will be able to **consummate** any such sale.” It accused the news media of **triggering a panic** among home buyers with **negative coverage**. But Evergrande’s funding channels **started drying up well** before last week. The company started forcing staff members to help **bail it out** as early as April, when it **began peddling the short-term loans**.
恒大曾试图卖掉其庞大帝国的部分业务以筹集新资金，但上周表示“不确定该集团是否能够完成任何此类出售”。它指责新闻媒体以负面报道引发购房者的恐慌。但早在上周之前，恒大的融资渠道就开始枯竭。该公司早在4月就开始兜售短期贷款，强迫员工帮助纾困。

The **extent of the campaign** and how much money it might have raised were unclear. Employees were told to each invest **a certain amount of** money in Evergrande **Wealth products**, and that if they failed to do so, their performance pay and bonuses would **be docked**. Mr. Liu said his parents and **in-laws** had invested $200,000, and that he had put about $75,000 of his own money into Evergrande Wealth.
尚不清楚恒大这一行为的广度以及可能已筹集到的资金数量。员工被告知每人要投资一定数量的恒大财富产品，如果不这样做，他们会被扣掉绩效工资和奖金。刘云亭说，他的父母和岳父母投资了130万元，他自己也投入了50万元到恒大财富。

Officials from China’s **top banking and insurance watchdogs** told executives to **sort out their towering debt** in order to maintain the stability of China’s financial market.
中国最高银行和保险监管机构的官员要求高管们清理巨额债务，以维护中国金融市场的稳定。

Under **heightened scrutiny**, Evergrande gathered its top executives earlier this month and asked them to publicly sign what it called a “**military order**” ― **a pledge to** complete unfinished property developments.
在更严格的审查下，恒大本月早些时候召集了其高管，要求他们公开签署所谓的“保交楼军令状”――保证未完成的楼盘完成交付。

Everyone is anxious, we are **a bit like ants on a hot pan**, having no idea what to do, we hope the protests would **prompt the government to** act before it was too late. it will get the central government to pay enough attention. Then someone would **come out to intervene**.
大家都急了，我们就有点像热锅上的蚂蚁，有点毫无头绪，我们希望抗议活动能促使政府在为时已晚之前采取行动。能够引起上面的重视，后续自然而然地就有可能有人出来干预了。

I was **sitting at a stoplight** in Beijing when I first noticed the young men who would walk in between cars and **hand out brochures to drivers**. I **rolled down the window** and took one. To my surprise, it was **a for-sale advertisement** for apartments in a newly constructed building.
在北京的一个红绿灯前，我第一次注意到有年轻人走在汽?之间发小广告。我摇下?窗，接过来一份。令我惊讶的是，这是一个售楼广告。

This was in 2010, when the American economy was still **enduring the aftereffects** of its **burst housing bubble**. I had covered the rise of that bubble, and **the fliers** in Beijing reminded me of Florida during its **frothiest days**: The Chinese real-estate market had grown so hot that the people **were marketing apartments** at red lights, **as if buying one were as common as buying a soda**.
那是在2010年，当时美国经济还在承受房地产泡沫破裂的后遗症。我曾报道过那次泡沫的兴起，北京的传单让我想起了泡沫最严重的佛罗里达:中国房地产市场变得如此火爆，以至于人们在等红灯的时候推销公寓，好像买房就像买汽水一样平常。

There were many other **signs of a property bubble** during that trip. **On sidewalks** in Shanghai, I walked past **real-estate agencies** that had **set up** outdoor tables, to **accommodate** all of the demand. **Around this same time**, Jim Chanos, a **prominent** American investor, warned that China’s **real-estate excesses** had **placed it on a “treadmill to hell”** and that the **bubble might burst** at any point.
在那次访问期间，我还看到其他许多房地产泡沫的迹象。在上海的人行道上，我经过一些房地产中介，他们为了满足所有的需求，把桌子摆到了外面。大约在同一时间，美国著名投资者吉姆・查诺斯警告，中国的房地产过度已经让它处于“通往地狱的跑步机上”，泡沫随时可能破裂。

A recent **slowing of** the real-estate sales in China appears to put Evergrande **on the brink of insolvency**. Without **as much cash flow as** in prior years, the company may be unable to **meet a large payment due** tomorrow. 
最近该市场的销售放缓，似乎将恒大推到了破产边缘。没有了往年那么多的现金流，公司可能无法支付明天到期的一大笔款项。

Some other Chinese developers may also be in trouble. And **by almost any measure**, Chinese real estate is **suspiciously expensive**. Consider **the median price** of homes in China’s largest cities **relative to** the median incomes in those cities ― a classic measure of **housing valuation** (and one that **was blinking bright red** in the U.S. before the housing bubble burst):
其他一些中国开发商可能也遇到了麻烦。而且无论以什么标准衡量，中国的房地产都贵得令人怀疑。考虑一下中国大城市的房价中位数相对于这些城市的收入中位数的比值――这是衡量房价价值的一个经典指标(在房地产泡沫破裂之前，这个指标在美国一直闪烁着鲜红色)

China’s real-estate is a bubble of **epic proportions**, one that by various metrics easily **overshadows** the pre-global financial crisis **run-up** in U.S. property values (which burst with such **disastrous consequences**) or **the unsustainable booms** in European countries such as Ireland and Spain. It **stands comparison with** the Japanese real estate bubble of the 1980s, which helped send the country into at least one “**lost decade**” when it finally burst in the early 1990s.
中国的房地产是一个史诗级的泡沫，以各种指标衡量，它轻而易举地盖过了全球 金融危机前美国房地产价格的飙升(其泡沫破裂带来了灾难性的后果)，或者盖过了爱尔兰和?班牙等欧洲国家不可持续的繁荣。它可以同上世纪80年代的日本房地产泡沫相提并论，后者在90年代初最终破灭时令该国进入了至少一个“失去的十年”。

For thousands of years, Chinese emperors tried to **achieve immortality** by **swallowing all kinds of stuff**. None worked.
几千年来，中国的皇帝为了?生不老吃下了各种东?。但都没有成功。

**Given all of this**, China can **partly grow into** its housing bubble. Many families’ incomes are **rising rapidly enough**, for instance, that they are able to **meet mortgage payments** that **initially may have looked ambitious**.
综上所述，中国可能在一定程度上发展到适应房地产泡沫的程度。例如，许多家庭的收入增?很快，他们能够支付当初看起来数字很大的抵押贷款。

China’s government also has large **cash reserves** and has **been willing to do whatever is necessary to** avoid an economic crisis. Over the past several years, the government has taken steps to **cool the market**, like restricting sales and home loans **in some situations**. Those moves have **slowed down price increases** in recent years. **The longevity of the boom** suggests that the market is more complex than its **depictions** as a bubble suggest
中国政府也拥有大量现金储备，并愿意采取一切必要措施避免经济危机。在过去几年里，政府已经采取措施给市场降温，比如在某些情况下限制销售和住房贷款。这些举措减缓了近年来的价格上涨。繁荣的持久性表明，比起将它描述为泡沫，这个市场要复杂得多。

He agreed that China’s economy **suffered from imbalances**, including too much construction. Still, he added, “I think we have plenty of time, plenty of tools and **plenty of instruments to make a soft landing** and **a smooth transformation**.”
他同意中国经济存在不平衡，包括过多的建设。不过，他还说，“我认为我们有充足的时间、充足的工具和充足的手段来实现软着陆和平稳转型。”

**Based on standard economic measures**, China still has **not done nearly enough to fix its imbalances** ― and it’s usually a mistake to **bet against** the normal rules of economics. But China’s **unmatched size** and **long record of growth** offer reasons at least to **wonder whether** this bubble really is different.
根据规范的经济衡量标准，中国在解决失衡问题上做得还远远不够――而在通常情况下，与正常的经济规则对赌是错误的。但中国无与伦比的规模和?期增?记录至少让人有理由怀疑，这次泡沫是否真的有所不同。

Almost two years since the novel coronavirus began to **circulate through the human population**, what lessons have we learned? And what do those lessons **portend for future crises?** The most obvious is the hardest to **digest**: The world’s **decision makers** have given us **a staggering demonstration** of their **collective inability to grasp** what it would actually **mean to govern the deeply globalized and interconnected world** they have created. 
新型冠状病毒在人群中传播已有近两年时间，我们从中得到了什么教训?这些教训又预示了怎样的未来危机? 最明显的也是最难接受的:全世界的决策者们向我们展示了令人震惊的集体无能。他们无法理解，在他们所创造的这个高度全球化的互联世界中，治理到底意味着什么。

There is only **one limited realm** in which something like **a concerted response** has been managed: money and finance. But governments’ and central banks’ success in holding the world’s financial system together **is contributing in the long run to inequality and social polarization**. If 2020 was **a trial run**, we should be worried.
只有一个领域拿出了算得上是协调一致的应对办法:货币和金融。但从?远来看，政府和央行对世界金融体系的成功维系，将会助?不平等和社会两极分化。如果2020年是一 次预演，我们理应感到担忧。

As **instruments of coordination and cooperation**, global institutions like the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Health Organization had **proved fragile and toothless long before the pandemic**. The explanation for this failure **used to be geopolitical antagonism**: **Power blocs** couldn’t come together when they had competing priorities and agendas. It was **thus tempting to imagine** that some common threat ― perhaps **an alien invasion** ― might **make a reality of** the United Nations.
作为协调与合作的载体，联合国、国际货币基金组织和世界卫生组织等全球机构早在疫情暴发前就已被证明是脆弱且无力的。以往对这种失败的解释是地缘政治对立:当优先事项和议程相互冲突时，大国集团就不能团结一致。因此，人们很容易设想某种共同的威胁――或许是一次外星人入侵――可能会使联合国成为真正的现实。

**And yet** faced with this **common threat**, cooperation failed. **Rather than a concerted shutdown** of global aviation, frontiers were closed **on the fly**; supplies of **personal protective equipment were grabbed** at airports; **haphazard travel bans** continue to this day.
然而，面对这一共同威胁，合作失败了。各国没能协同一致关停全球航空业，而是匆匆忙忙封锁边境;个人防护装备物资在机场被抢走;盲目的旅行禁令一直持续到今日。

It was **a horrible irony** that Donald Trump, the first American president to **repudiate** this, was in the White House when a truly global crisis hit. That encouraged talk of Covid as the first “post-American” crisis. But America will have to **diminish a lot more before we can count it out**. What 2020 showed, in fact, was that America’s **dysfunctions** are the world’s problem.
特别讽刺的一点在于，当真正的全球危机来袭，第一位否认这一点的美国总统特朗普正在主政白宫。这促使人们将新冠疫情称为第一场“后美国时代”的危机。但要真正给美国判负出局，它还得经历更多衰败。事实上，2020年表明，美国机能失调是世界的问题。

The development of Covid vaccines was **a collective triumph** of researchers, governments and businesses around the world. Mr. Trump’s **Operation Warp Speed** was the most successful of all. **Scandalously**, the United States under Mr. Trump did not even join the United Nations’ Covax initiative. Even after vaccine **rollout** began in earnest in 2021, the United States continued to **hoard doses**.
新冠疫苗的开发是世界各地研究人员、政府和企业的集体胜利。特朗普的“曲速行动”是其中最成功的。令人愤慨的是，在特朗普的领导下，美国甚至没有加入联合国的“2019冠状病毒病疫苗实施计划”。即便在2021年疫苗开始正式推广后，美国仍在囤积。

The failure to develop a global vaccination program is not just **dismaying**. It **ought also to be profoundly puzzling**: It **defies the self- interests** of the richest countries in the world. **Booster shots aside**, the greater the volume of infection, **the greater the risk of variants** even more dangerous than Delta. And the greater the economic damage, too. 
未能实现一个全球疫苗接种计划不仅是令人沮丧的，也应该让人深感困惑:这违背了全世界那些最富有国家的自身利益。抛开加强针不算，感染人数越多，出现比德尔塔还危险的变种毒株的?险也越高。经济损失也会更加严重。

This failure is **all the more glaring for** another lesson that the pandemic **revealed**: Budget constraints don’t seem to exist; money is **a mere technicality**. The hard limits of financial sustainability, policed, we used to think, by **ferocious bond markets**, were **blurred** by the 2008 financial crisis. In 2020, they were **erased**.
这样的失败更凸显了疫情揭示的另一个教训:预算似乎是不存在约束的;金钱不过是个技术问题。2008年的金融危机模糊了金融可持续性的硬性限制，我们过去一直以为这种可持续性由激荡的债券市场控制。而在2020年，这些限制都被抹去了。

Governments around the world **issued debt as not seen** since World War II, and yet **interest rates plunged**. As the private sector shut down, the public sector expanded. As government **deficits grew**, the **monetary system responded elastically**. Government spending **made up for the loss** of private incomes and spending.
世界各国政府发行了人们自“二战”以来都未?过的大量债券，利率却大幅下跌。随着私营部?的关闭，公共部?实现了扩张。随着政府赤字的增加，货币体系反应剧烈。政府支出弥补了个人收入和消费的减少。

This balancing of public and private spending works best if all countries are doing it **simultaneously**. This was one area where there was **an alignment of** national policies. 
这种平衡公共和私人支出的做法，在各国统一行动时效果最佳。这也是国家政策唯一存在共进退的领域。

But **when it came to it**, Mr. Trump’s **instincts all pushed in the right direction**, at least on economic policy. If ever there was a president who **took naturally to** the idea of “**fiat money**,” it was Donald Trump. **So long as** his name was on the checks, **more was better**.
但事情到了那一步的时候，特朗普的直觉都是朝着正确方向推进的，至少在经济政策上是这样。如果说有哪位总统很自然地接受了“法定货币”的概念，那就是特朗普。只要支票上有他的名字，就多多益善。

Global finance is a world with **a clear hierarchy**, with **the Fed** at the top, followed by the European Central Bank, the People’s Bank of China, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England. But it is also **a close-knit community** with a shared **mental map**. Central bankers **trade in electronic money** that can be created **at the tap of a keyboard**. Creating it does not “cost” anything and does not require approval from **elected legislatures**. After 2008, tools like **quantitative easing** ― the large-scale purchase of assets ― **were well oiled**.
全球金融是一个等级分明的世界，美联储高高在上，其次是欧洲中央银行、中国人?银行、日本银行和英格兰银行。但它也是一个紧密联系的社区，拥有一个共同的思维地图。中央银行家交易的电子货币只需敲击键盘即可产生。创建它不“花费”任何东?，也不需要获得?选立法机构的批准。2008年之后，像量化宽松(大规模购买资产)这样的工具已经驾轻就熟。

The world discovered that John Maynard Keynes was right when he declared during World War II that “**anything we can actually do, we can afford**.” The **sheer scale** of the action was **intoxicating**. Among **the left wing** of the Democratic Party, it generated excitement: If money was a mere technicality, **what else** could be done? Action on **social justice**, climate change, the Green New Deal, **all seemed within reach**.
世界发现，当凯恩斯在“二战”期间宣称“凡是我们实际上能做到的事情，我们都能负担得起”时，他是对的。这一行动的规模之大令人陶醉。?主党左翼对此感到兴奋:如果金钱只是一个技术问题，我们还能做什么?社会公正、气候变化、绿色新政等方面的行动似乎都触手可及。

But there were three **interrelated problems**. First, **the sense** that government action had **been liberated from the tyranny** of finance was **illusory**. That meant, second, that the interventions were **double-edged**. Finally, the digital money creation was the **easy bit**. 
但有三个相互关联的问题。首先，认为政府行动已从金融暴政中解放出来的感觉是虚幻的。其次，这意味着这些干预措施是一把双刃剑。最后，创造数字货币是件容易的事。

**Propping up** the Treasury market enabled government **spending on furlough schemes** and paycheck protection plans to be funded in the normal way, by borrowing. But government IOUs **are fuel for private speculation**. When **liquidity is flushed indiscriminately into** the financial system, it **inflates bubbles**, generating new risks and **outsize gains** for those with **substantial portfolios. Nowhere** was this **polarizing effect more pronounced** than in the United States. While tens of millions **struggled through** the crisis, trillions of dollars **piled up in the balance sheets** of the wealthy.
对国债市场的支撑使政府在强制无薪休假和工资保护计划上的支出能够以正常的方式(通过借贷)获得资金。但政府的欠条助?了私人投机问题。当流动性不分?红皂白地涌入金融体系时，它就会催生泡沫，给那些拥有大量投资组合的人带来新的?险和超额收益。这种两极分化效应在美国最为明显。在数千万人挣扎着度过危机的同时，富人们的资产负债表上积累了数万亿美元。

Keynes’s **bon mot has a sting in its tail**: We can afford anything we can actually do. The problem is agreeing on what to do and how to do it. **In giving us a glimpse of** financial freedom, 2020 also **robbed us of pretenses** and excuses. 
凯恩斯的妙语背后是一个煞?景的结局:我们能负担得起我们“实际上”能做的任何事情。问题在于就做什么和如何做达成一致。在让我们瞥?财务自由的同时，2020年也剥夺了我们的伪装和借口。

It **turns out** that budget constraints, **in all their artificiality**, had **spared us from facing the all-too-limited willingness** and capacity for collective action. Either you are **invoking technological obstacles**, in which case we need **a suitably scaled**, Warp Speed-style program to **overcome them**, or it is **simply a matter of priorities**. There are other things you would rather do.
事实证明，尽管预算限制是人为的，但它使我们免于面对过于有限的集体行动意愿和能力。要么你是在援引技术障碍――在这种情况下，我们需要一个规模适当的、“曲速行动”式的项目来克服它们――要么这只是一个优先级问题，你更愿意去做其他事情。

**Looking back before 2020**, it seemed that 2008 was the beginning of **a new era of successive and interconnected disruptions**, such as the global financial crisis, Mr. Trump’s election, and the trade and tech war with China. **It all had a familiar ring to it**. Great-power competition, **nationalism** and banking crises all **harked back to** the 19th and 20th centuries. Then came 2020. It has given us **a glimpse of something radically new**: the old tensions of politics, finance and **geopolitics intersecting with** a natural shock on **a global scale**.
回顾2020年以前，似乎2008年是一个新时代的开始，颠覆连续到来，并且相互关联，如全球金融危机、特朗普的大选和与中国的贸易和技术战争。这一切都并不陌生。大国竞争、?族主义和银行业危机都可以追溯到19世纪和20世纪。然后2020年来了。它让我们瞥?了一些全新的东?:旧有的政治、金融和地缘政治的紧张局势与全球范围内的自然冲击相交在一起。

As recent events in Afghanistan demonstrate, President Biden is determined to **clear the decks**, brutally if necessary. **As far as the Pentagon is concerned**, at the top of the agenda is great-power competition with China ― a 19th century **writ large**.
正如最近在阿富汗发生的事件所表明的那样，拜登总统决心扫清障碍，必要时可以毫不留情。对五?大楼而言，议程的首要任务是与中国的大国竞争――这是19世纪的一件大事

But what of the interconnected global crises of the 21st century that cannot **be attributed to a national antagonist**? **For those**, the one model that we have is central bank financial market intervention ― a form of crisis-fighting based on technical networks, **rooted in** existing hierarchies of power and backed by powerful self-interest. It is conservative, **ad hoc** and lacking in **explicit political legitimacy**. It **tends to reinforce** existing hierarchy and privilege.
但21世纪那些相互关联的、不能归咎于国家竞争的全球危机又如何呢?对于那些危机来说，我们拥有的一个模型是央行金融市场干预――一种基于技术网络的危机对抗形式，植根于现有的权力等级并以强大的自身利益为后盾。它是保守的、临时的，缺乏明确的政治合法性。它倾向于强化现有的等级制度和特权。

The challenge for **a progressive globalism fit for** the next decades is both to **multiply those crisis-fighting networks ― into** the fields of medical research and vaccine development, renewable energy and so on 
未来几十年更适用的是渐进式全球主义，它面临的挑战是将这些抗击危机的网络扩大到医学研究和疫苗开发、可再生能源等领域
