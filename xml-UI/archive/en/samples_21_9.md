**‘Reversing Gears’**: China Increasingly Rejects English  
“开倒?”？中国弱化英语教育

As a student at Peking University law school in 1978, Li Keqiang kept
both pockets of his jacket **stuffed with handwritten paper slips**.   
1978在北大法学院读书时，李克强外套口袋里塞满了手写的纸条

It’s hard to **exaggerate** the role English has played in changing China’s
social, cultural, economic and **political landscape**.  
英语在改变中国社会、文化、经济和政治面貌方面的所起的作用，怎么说都不过分

English is almost
**synonymous with China’s reform and opening-up policies**, which
transformed an **impoverished and hermetic** nation into the world’s
**second-biggest** economy.  
英语几乎是中国改革开放政策的代名词，该政策将一个贫穷封闭的国家变成世界第二大经济体

That’s why it came as a shock to many when the education authorities
in Shanghai, **the most cosmopolitan city** in the country, last month
**forbade** local elementary schools to **hold final exams** on the English
language.  
这就是为什么当上海这个国际化大都市教育部门禁止小学举行英语期末考试，许多人感到震惊

**Broadly**, the Chinese authorities are **easing the workloads** of
schoolchildren, amid an effort to **ease the burdens** on families and
parents.
总的来说，中国政府正在减轻学习任务，致力于减轻家庭和家长的负担

The president of **prestigious** Tsinghua University in Beijing **came
under fire** this summer after sending each new student a Chinese language
copy of Ernest Hemingway’s “The Old Man and the Sea.” He
wrote in a letter that he wanted the students to **learn courage and
perseverance**.   
今夏著名学府清华大学校长在给每位新生发一本《老人与海》中文版后，受到抨击。他在一封信中写道，希望学生们学会勇气和毅力

Some businesspeople **struck gold** by teaching English or offering
instruction on how to take tests in the language.  
有商人靠英语辅导和提供考试指导而发了大财

English **lost some of its sheen** after the 2008 financial crisis.  
2008金融危机后，英语失去了一些光彩

As a result,
China’s links to the outside world are being **severed** one by one.  
结果，中国与外部世界的联系正在被一一切断

Share prices of New Oriental, the education
giant, **tanked** in July after the Beijing government announced
crackdowns on **after-school tutoring services**. The Shanghai
government’s announcement **drew praise** online from some
**nationalistic quarters**.
在北京市政府宣布打击课外辅导机构后，新东方的股价出现暴跌。上海市政府的公告在网上受到一些民族主义团体的赞扬

The U.S. **withdrawal** from Afghanistan after a failed 20-year **nation-building exercise** has left many Americans and analysts saying, “If only we knew **back then** what we know now, we would have never **gone down** that path.”
在经历了为期20年的建国实践失败后，美国从阿富汗撤军，这让许 多美国人和分析人士说，“早知如此，我们就不会走这条路了。"

And my fears can be **summed up in** just a few paragraphs: The 40 years from 1979 to 2019 were **an epoch** in U.S.-China relations. There were **many ups and downs**, but **all in all** it was an epoch of **steady economic integration** between our two countries.
我的担心可以用几段话来概括:从1979年到2019年的40年是美中关 系的一个纪元。有许多起起落落，但总而言之，这是两国经济稳定 一体化的时代。

The depth of that U.S.-China integration helped to **fuel a much deeper globalization** of the world economy and **buttress four decades of relative peace** between the world’s two great powers.
美中一体化的深度有助于推动世界经济实现更深层次的全球化，并 支撑了世界两个大国之间40年的相对和平。

**In short**, the relative peace and prosperity that the world  experienced in those 40 years cannot be explained **without 
reference to the U.S.-China bonding**.
简而言之，如果不提美中关系，就无法解释世界在这40年所经历的相对和平与繁荣。

It **lifted out of poverty** hundreds of millions of people in China, India and East Asia **while making many products much more affordable** to more American consumers.
它使中国、印度和东亚的数亿人摆脱了 贫困，同时使更多的美国消费者能够负担得起许多产品。

For the past five years, though, the United States and China **have been stumbling down a path of de-integration** and maybe toward **outright confrontation**. 
然而，过去五年里，美国和中国一直在脱离一体化的道路上跌跌撞 撞，甚至可能走向彻底对抗。

These two giants **went from** doing a lot of business on the table and occasionally kicking each other under the table **to** doing a lot less business on the table and kicking each other a lot harder under the table ― so much harder that they are in danger of breaking the table and leaving each other **with a limp**. 
起初，这两个巨头在台面上来往密切，偶尔在台下使绊子，现在变 成了在台面上生意少了，台下使绊子越来越激烈――激烈得连台面 都快要打破，两败俱伤地离开

**For starters** we need to ask: **What aspects** of our competition/conflict with China are **inevitable** between a rising power and **a status quo power**, and what can be **dampened** by smart policy?
首先，我们需要问:在一个崛起的大国和一个维持现状的大国之 间，我们与中国的竞争/冲突在哪些方面是不可避免的，在哪些方面 可以通过明智的政策起到抑制作用?

When China sold us “**shallow goods**,” we didn’t care whether its government was **authoritarian, libertarian or vegetarian**. But when it comes to our buying China’s “deep goods,” **shared values matter** and they are not there.
当中国卖给我们“浅层商品”时，我 们不在乎它的政府是威权主义、自由主义还是素?主义。但当谈到 我们购买中国的“深层商品”时，共同价值观念很重要，但它们却并不存在。

if we are now going to **shift our focus** from the Middle East to an **irreversible strategy** of confronting China, we should **start by asking** three foundational questions
如果我们现在要将关注 点从中东转移到对抗中国的不可逆转的战略上，我们应该先问三个 基本问题

Are we sure we understand **the dynamics of an immense and changing society** like China well enough to decide that its inevitable mission is the global spread of authoritarianism? Especially when this will require **a generational adversarial commitment** on the part of the United States, **engendering** in turn a **still more** nationalistic China?
中国社会巨大且不断变化，我们是否对其动 态有真正足够的了解，就决定说在全球传播威权主义是它不可避免 的使命?尤其是当它需要美国将反对的决心代际传递下去，反过来 又会导致一个更加?族主义的中国?

Because without that, any **coalition will crumble**.
因为做不到这一点的话，任何联盟都会瓦解

When we make it the world **versus** China on what are the best and most just **international norms**, we isolate **the hard-liners** in Beijing and ***leverage** more Chinese reformers on our side.
当我 们让世界与中国在何为最好和最公正的国际规范对立时，我们就可 以孤立北京的强硬派，并让中国更多的改革派站在我们这边。

But China will not respond just to **high-minded** talk of international norms, even if faced with a global coalition. Such talk has to be **backed up** with economic and **military clout**.
但即使面对一个全球联盟，中国也不会只对国际规范的高姿态谈话 作出回应。这种谈话必须得到经济和军事影响力的支持。

It might **light a fire** under Americans to get serious about **national renewal**. But it might also light a fire to the whole U.S.-China relationship, affecting everything from supply chains to student exchanges to Chinese purchases of U.S. **government bonds**.
它也许能点燃美国人对国家复兴的激情。 但这也可能点燃整个美中关系，影响从供应链到学生交流，再到中 国购买美国政府债券的方方面面。

This Sept. 11, a **diminished** president will **preside** over a diminished nation. Another Failed Presidency **at Hand**
今年的9・11到来时，一个已经降格的国家，正在由一位降格的总统掌管着。拜登，又一个即将失败的总统

We are a country that could not keep a **demagogue** from the White House; could not stop an insurrectionist mob from **storming** the Capitol; could not win (or at least avoid losing) a war against a **morally and technologically retrograde** enemy; cannot **conquer a disease** for which there are safe and effective vaccines; and cannot bring itself to trust the government, the news media, the **scientific establishment**, the police or any other institution meant to operate for **the common good**.
我们这个国家无法阻止一名煽动者进入白宫;无法阻止暴徒袭击国会 大厦;无法打赢(或至少避免被打败)一场与道德和技术上都落后的敌人的战争;无法战胜疾病，即使有安全有效的疫苗;并且无法相信 政府、新闻媒体、科学机构、警察或任何其他旨在为公共利益运作的机构。

A civilization “**is born stoic and dies epicurean**,” wrote historian Will Durant about the **Babylonians**. Our civilization was born **optimistic and enlightened**, at least by the standards of the day. Now it feels as if it’s **fading into paranoid senility**.
历史学家威尔・杜兰特在谈到巴比伦人时写道，一个文 明“生于坚忍，死于享乐”。我们的文明生来是乐观和开明的，至少按照当时的标准是这样。现在感觉它好像正在逐渐衰老，变得疑神疑?。

Joe Biden was supposed to be **the man of the hour**: a **calming** presence **exuding decency, moderation** and trust. As a candidate, he **sold himself as** a transitional president, a **fatherly** figure in the **mold** of George H.W. Bush who would restore **dignity and prudence** to the Oval Office after the **mendacity and chaos** that came before. It’s why I voted for him, as did so many others who once **tipped red**.
乔・拜登本应是这个时刻的主?:从容出场，散发着正派、温和和值得信任的气质。作为候选人，他标榜自己是转型总统， 一个像乔治・H・W・布什一样的父亲般的人物，在椭圆形办公室经历了先前的谎言和混乱之后，他将恢复其尊严和审慎。这就是我投票给他的原因，就像许多其他曾经倾向共和党的人一样

Instead, Biden has become the **emblem** of the hour: **headstrong** but shaky, ambitious but **inept**. He seems to be the last person in America to realize that, whatever the **theoretical merits** of the decision to withdraw our remaining troops from Afghanistan, the military and intelligence assumptions on which it was built were **deeply flawed**, the manner in which it was executed was a national **humiliation** and a **moral betrayal**, and the timing was **catastrophic**.
相反，拜登在这个时刻却成为了这样的象征:固执但摇摆不定，雄心 勃勃但无能。无论是从阿富汗撤出剩余部队的决定有什么理论价值， 该决定所依据的军事和情报假设存在严重缺陷，其执行方式是对国家的羞辱和道德上的背叛，其时机是灾难性的，拜登似乎是美国最后一个意识到这些的人

The 9/11 memorial at the  World Trade Center ― water **cascading into one void**, and then  **trickling**, out of sight, into another ― has **never felt more fitting**.
在世贸中心的9・11纪念广场，水向下流入一层空洞，水流逐渐变弱、消失，淌入另一层空洞，这样的意象从未让人感到如此贴切。

That’s the **optimistic scenario**. **Alternatively**, he could suffer a legislative **calamity** like Hillary Clinton’s health care reform in 1994, which would have ended Bill Clinton’s presidency save for his **sharp swing** to the center
这是乐观的情况。或者，他可能会遭受像1994年希拉里・克林顿的医疗改革那样的立法灾难，好在比尔・克林顿急剧转向中间派

Even the optimistic **precedent** was followed by a Democratic **rout** in 2010, when the party lost 63 House seats. If history repeats itself at the 2022 midterms, I doubt that even Joe Biden’s **closest aides** think he has the **stamina** to fight his way back in 2024. Has Kamala Harris shown the political talent to **pick up the pieces**?
即使?主党有这一乐观的先例，它在2010年仍遭遇了溃败，当时该党失去了63个众议院席位。如果历史在2022年中期选举重演，我怀疑即使是乔・拜登最亲密的助手都会觉得他的精力不足以撑到在2024年重回巅峰。卡玛拉・哈里斯(Kamala Harris)有没有显示出收拾残局 的政治才能?

Perhaps what will save the Democrats is that Biden’s weakness will **tempt** Donald Trump to seek (and almost certainly gain) the Republican nomination
如果拜登的软弱诱使唐纳德・特朗普寻求(并且几乎肯定会获得)共和党提名，这或许能拯救?主党

There’s a **way back from this cliff’s edge**. It begins with Biden finding a way to acknowledge publicly the **gravity** of his administration’s **blunders**
现在悬崖勒?还来得及。首先，拜登需要以某种方式来公开承认其政府犯错误的严重性

He’s proud, **inflexible**, and thinks **he’s much smarter than he really is**. That’s bad news for the administration. It’s worse news for a country that **desperately needs** to avoid another failed presidency
他骄傲、固执，高估自己的智力。对政府来说， 这是个坏消息。对于一个迫切需要避免又一段失败的总统任期的国家来说，这是个更坏的消息

Impressing other writers and academics **ceased** to be my goal. Instead, I would focus on using my words to find beauty and hope.
我的目标不再是给其他作家和学者留下深刻的印象。相反，我会专注于用我的文字来寻找美丽和希望

This pandemic has left conversations and lives **cut short**.
这场大流行使谈话和生命都缩短了

And it seems to be bringing a similar **clarity** to people about their priorities: The pandemic has led to one of the largest **shifts** in jobs in recent memory, with millions of Americans making changes.
它似乎也让人们认清了什么是重要的:大流行导致了相当?一段时间里最大的劳动力市场转型之一，数百万美国人做出了改变

The pandemic has **disabused** us of the **illusion** of time as a **limitless** resource and of the false promise that the sacrifices we make for our careers are always **worth** it.
这场疫情使我们摆脱了时间是一个无穷的资源的错觉，以及我们为职业做出的牺牲总是值得的虚假承诺。

In the meantime, exercise and a **reasonable** diet was the **tithes** we paid to our fear
与此同时，锻炼和合理的饮?只是我们为恐惧付出的一小部分

For all that we know about the relatively **low mortality rates** of Covid-19 among the young, it remains something of a **deadly** lottery
尽管我们知道年轻人中Covid-19的死亡率相对较低，但它仍然是一种致命的彩票

We have had to consider our **collective** mortality. And we **are now faced with** the question of meaning. Like the **biblical psalmist** says, “We have escaped like a bird from the fowler’s snare; the **snare** has been broken, and we have escaped.” (Psalm 124:7). Covid-19 **threatened to capture** us in its snare, but **thus far** we have **eluded** it. What shall we do with this opportunity?
我们不得不考虑我们的集体死亡率。我们现在面临着意义的问题。正如圣经中的诗人所说:“我们好像雀?，从捕?人的罗网里逃脱，罗网破裂，我们就逃脱了。”(诗篇124:7)。Covid-19威胁要用它的罗网俘获我们，但到目前为止我们都躲过了它。我们要如何利用这个契机?

When we had the **illusion of time**, the lower pay, long **commutes**, high cost of  living and separation from loved ones seemed a small price to pay for a successful career. But the pandemic reminded us that there are some things more important than **vocational** progress.
值得。当我们有时间的错觉时，较低的工资、?时间的通勤、高昂的生活成本和与亲人的分离似乎是为成功的事业付出的微不足道的代价。但疫情提醒我们，有些事情比职业发展更重要。

This was **equally true** for single friends who lived in areas where the entire social scene **catered to** married people with families.
对于一些单身朋友来说也是如此，他们住在所有社交活动都迎合有家庭的已婚人士的地区

The pandemic has reminded us that **life is more than what we do**
这场大流行病提醒我们，生活不只是我们所做的事

I **recognize** that for some, Covid-19 did not raise the same **existential** questions. 
我意识到对有些人而言，Covid-19没有引发同样关乎存在意义的问题

**Nonetheless**, I have **relatives** in service industries raising similar questions. They are **no longer willing** to deal with harassment from rude customers for a **barely livable wage**. They are **struggling to** pay their bills, but they are doing so **on their terms** with their **humanity intact**
尽管如此，我有一些在服务行业的亲戚也提出了相似的问题。他们不再愿意为了一份勉强维持生活的收入而应付粗鲁顾客的骚扰。他们正在吃力地支付账单，不过是在符合他们自己的意愿、他们的人性完好无损的条件下来做这些事。

If there is a lesson in this for employers, it is to remember that employees are **more than** workers. We have an **identity** outside the hours **committed to making a living**. Jobs that treat their employees **honorably**, provide flexibility and **leave room** for life outside of work will **thrive**
如果这些对雇主来说有什么教训的话，那就是要记住，员工不仅仅是工人。我们有一种在用于谋生的时间之外的身份。体面对待员工、提供灵活性并为工作之外的生活留出空间的工作将会蓬勃发展

I did not get to speak to my father a final time, but I did deliver the **eulogy** at his funeral. The need to **make sense of** his death revealed what was so often hard to see in the **ebb and flow** of our life together. He was like most of us, **a mass of contradictions**.
我没能和我父亲说上最后一次话，但我在他的葬礼上致了悼词。理解他的死亡这个需求，揭示了在我们共同生活的起起落落中很难看到的东?. 他和我们大多数人一样，是矛盾的集合体。

I confronted him about things he had done and the real pain he caused. It was not a **healing**, but it began something we never got to finish.
我质问他所做过的事和他造成的痛苦。这不是一种治愈，但它开始了一种我们未能完成的东?。 

When he died, I was in **the early stages** of writing what became “Reading While Black.” It has the following **dedication**: “This book **is dedicated to** the memory of Esau McCaulley Sr., who died before he ever got to see a book **bearing** our name in print. **Whatever else** I am, I will always remain your son.”
他去世的时候，我刚开始写《黑人的阅读》(Reading While Black)， 它的致辞是这样的:“这本书献给依绍・?卡利(Esau McCaulley Sr.)，他在看到一本印有我们名字的书之前就去世了。不论我还有什么身份，我始终是你的儿子。”

It seems that Covid-19 has **dealt a collective trauma** to the American **consciousness** and that **the full fruit of** that trauma remains uncertain. One thing is clear: Our previous normal was **not as good as we thought it was**.
Covid-19似乎对美国人的意识造成了集体性创伤，这种创伤的全部后果还不确定。有一件事是清楚无疑的:我们过去的常态并不如我们以为的那般坚固美好
