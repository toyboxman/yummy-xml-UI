There’s the rest of us that are really eagerly anticipating the impacts so that we can take our science and run with it, It’s going to be so great and such an exciting once-in-a-lifetime event that we are throwing everything that we have at it.
我们其他人都在热切期待着这样的撞击，这样就可以将我们的科学研究付诸实践，那将是一场如此伟大、如此激动人心的千载难逢的盛事，我们也将为此倾尽全力。

It’s the plot point for more than one Hollywood blockbuster: A rogue asteroid is hurtling toward Earth, threatening tsunamis, mass destruction and the death of every human being on the planet. Humanity has one shot to save itself with brave, self-sacrificing heroes piloting a spacecraft into the cosmos to destroy the asteroid.
这是好莱坞大片的常见情节了：一颗失控小行星冲向地球，可能造成海啸、大规模毁坏和全人类灭绝。人类只有一次自救机会——勇敢、甘愿自我牺牲的英雄驾驶着宇宙飞船飞向太空，将小行星摧毁。

Tantan and Momo had long matched users based on their physical appearance, leading to accusations that the platforms cultivated a hookup culture. More recently, these apps have started using people’s interests, hobbies and personalities as the basis for new social encounters.
探探和陌陌曾在以前很长一段时间里根据用户的外表来匹配他们，导致了人们批评这两个平台培植一种勾搭文化。最近，这些软件开始以人们的兴趣、爱好和性格作为建立新社交的基础。

Many younger Chinese now want the apps to provide a more holistic experience that blends entertainment and hobby exploration — not just a love match. Young Chinese like gimmicks such as icebreakers and other playful things that are the starting points for communication
许多中国年轻人现在希望这些应用能提供一种更全面的体验，将娱乐和探索爱好结合在一起，而不只是找对象。中国年轻人喜欢活跃气氛的游戏，以及其他可作为交流起点的好玩的东西

Luxury storefronts have been replaced by pop-up shops selling masks. Whole floors of skyscrapers are deserted. Streets once crammed with locals and visitors jostling for space are quiet. This is “Asia’s World City,” Hong Kong’s self-appointed title
销售奢侈品的店铺被卖口罩的快闪店取代。摩天大楼整层整层地空着。曾经挤满了当地人和游客的街道现在悄无声息。这就是自诩为“亚洲国际都会”的香港的现状

Despite the positive spin, the damage of the past few years has been devastating. We have not lost the title — you could say it’s a bit tarnished, We have more people leaving than coming. To regain its competitiveness, they say, Hong Kong has to put itself back on a par with other international financial centers like London, New York and Singapore.
虽然存在正面的看法，但香港在过去几年里遭受的打击是毁灭性的。我们并没有失去那个称号，你也可以说它有一点儿受损, 离开香港的比来的人多. 他们说，香港要想重新获得竞争力，就必须回到与伦敦、纽约、新加坡等其他国际金融中心同等水平的做法。

The exodus has been harmful to the economy and Hong Kong’s labor force, which has shrunk to a decade low. It is incumbent upon the government to wean the community away from being fixated on Covid — return to normalcy is key
这种外流已给香港经济和劳动力造成了不利影响，香港的劳动力已萎缩到10年来的最低水平。政府有责任让社区摆脱对新冠病毒的过度关注，回归正常才是关键

Mr. Putin has already shown that he is willing to junk business relationships with countries like Germany, which required decades to establish, in hopes of bending them to his will.
普京已经表明，他将不惜抛弃与德国等国建立了几十年的商业关系，以期让这些国家服从他的意愿。

The pipelines are built of steel coated with concrete so that they can withstand underwater pressures. In other words, it takes a lot of force to damage them. The damaged pipelines had released an amount comparable to one day of methane emissions by the oil and gas industry globally.
管道由涂有混凝土的钢铁建造，因此可以承受水下压力。换句话说，破坏它们需要很大的力量。受损管道释放的甲烷量相当于全球油气行业一天的甲烷排放量。

Democracy’s spread over the past few centuries has rarely been linear, instead ebbing and flowing with the competing forces of autocracy. We are far and away the most countermajoritarian democracy in the world
在过去几个世纪，民主的传播很少呈线性，而是随着专制势力的斗争起起落落。美国无疑是世界上最反多数的民主国家

Once in power, unscrupulous leaders can sometimes manipulate the political environment to their own benefit, making it more likely that they will be victorious in future contests. By winning those elections, they gain the stamp of democratic legitimacy — even for actions that ultimately undermine democratic norms.
一旦掌权，不择手段的领导人有时会为自身利益操纵政治环境，使他们更可能在未来的竞争中获胜。通过赢得这些选举，他们获得了民主合法性的盖章认定——哪怕他们的行为最终破坏了民主规范

Rhetoric aside, the administration has signaled in numerous other ways that Putin’s threats have constrained support for Ukraine. Biden’s foreign policy team speaks of putting up guardrails in the conflict and congratulates themselves on their slow increase in assistance not provoking Mr. Putin. 
然而在言辞之外，拜登政府以许多其他方式表明，普京的威胁限制了对乌克兰的支持。拜登的外交政策团队谈到在冲突中安排好防护措施，并为在不激怒普京的情况下实现缓慢增援而沾沾自喜

Russia’s failure comes from “matching extravagant political aims in Ukraine to meager and inefficiently marshaled means. Tempting as it is to marvel at Russia’s strategic incompetence, we ought to be worried that the grave deficiencies Russia is demonstrating also haunt our own national security strategy. 
俄罗斯的失败源于“给乌克兰问题设定过高的政治目标，却匹配了匮乏和低效的手段”。尽管对俄罗斯的战略无能感到惊叹，但我们应该担心俄罗斯所表现出的严重缺陷也会困扰我们自己的国家安全战略。
