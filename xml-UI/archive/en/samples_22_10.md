There’s the rest of us that are really eagerly anticipating the impacts so that we can take our science and run with it, It’s going to be so great and such an exciting once-in-a-lifetime event that we are throwing everything that we have at it.
我们其他人都在热切期待着这样的撞击，这样就可以将我们的科学研究付诸实践，那将是一场如此伟大、如此激动人心的千载难逢的盛事，我们也将为此倾尽全力。

It’s the plot point for more than one Hollywood blockbuster: A rogue asteroid is hurtling toward Earth, threatening tsunamis, mass destruction and the death of every human being on the planet. Humanity has one shot to save itself with brave, self-sacrificing heroes piloting a spacecraft into the cosmos to destroy the asteroid.
这是好莱坞大片的常见情节了：一颗失控小行星冲向地球，可能造成海啸、大规模毁坏和全人类灭绝。人类只有一次自救机会——勇敢、甘愿自我牺牲的英雄驾驶着宇宙飞船飞向太空，将小行星摧毁。

Tantan and Momo had long matched users based on their physical appearance, leading to accusations that the platforms cultivated a hookup culture. More recently, these apps have started using people’s interests, hobbies and personalities as the basis for new social encounters.
探探和陌陌曾在以前很长一段时间里根据用户的外表来匹配他们，导致了人们批评这两个平台培植一种勾搭文化。最近，这些软件开始以人们的兴趣、爱好和性格作为建立新社交的基础。

Many younger Chinese now want the apps to provide a more holistic experience that blends entertainment and hobby exploration — not just a love match. Young Chinese like gimmicks such as icebreakers and other playful things that are the starting points for communication
许多中国年轻人现在希望这些应用能提供一种更全面的体验，将娱乐和探索爱好结合在一起，而不只是找对象。中国年轻人喜欢活跃气氛的游戏，以及其他可作为交流起点的好玩的东西

Luxury storefronts have been replaced by pop-up shops selling masks. Whole floors of skyscrapers are deserted. Streets once crammed with locals and visitors jostling for space are quiet. This is “Asia’s World City,” Hong Kong’s self-appointed title
销售奢侈品的店铺被卖口罩的快闪店取代。摩天大楼整层整层地空着。曾经挤满了当地人和游客的街道现在悄无声息。这就是自诩为“亚洲国际都会”的香港的现状

Despite the positive spin, the damage of the past few years has been devastating. We have not lost the title — you could say it’s a bit tarnished, We have more people leaving than coming. To regain its competitiveness, they say, Hong Kong has to put itself back on a par with other international financial centers like London, New York and Singapore.
虽然存在正面的看法，但香港在过去几年里遭受的打击是毁灭性的。我们并没有失去那个称号，你也可以说它有一点儿受损, 离开香港的比来的人多. 他们说，香港要想重新获得竞争力，就必须回到与伦敦、纽约、新加坡等其他国际金融中心同等水平的做法。

The exodus has been harmful to the economy and Hong Kong’s labor force, which has shrunk to a decade low. It is incumbent upon the government to wean the community away from being fixated on Covid — return to normalcy is key
这种外流已给香港经济和劳动力造成了不利影响，香港的劳动力已萎缩到10年来的最低水平。政府有责任让社区摆脱对新冠病毒的过度关注，回归正常才是关键

Mr. Putin has already shown that he is willing to junk business relationships with countries like Germany, which required decades to establish, in hopes of bending them to his will.
普京已经表明，他将不惜抛弃与德国等国建立了几十年的商业关系，以期让这些国家服从他的意愿。

The pipelines are built of steel coated with concrete so that they can withstand underwater pressures. In other words, it takes a lot of force to damage them. The damaged pipelines had released an amount comparable to one day of methane emissions by the oil and gas industry globally.
管道由涂有混凝土的钢铁建造，因此可以承受水下压力。换句话说，破坏它们需要很大的力量。受损管道释放的甲烷量相当于全球油气行业一天的甲烷排放量。

Democracy’s spread over the past few centuries has rarely been linear, instead ebbing and flowing with the competing forces of autocracy. We are far and away the most countermajoritarian democracy in the world
在过去几个世纪，民主的传播很少呈线性，而是随着专制势力的斗争起起落落。美国无疑是世界上最反多数的民主国家

Once in power, unscrupulous leaders can sometimes manipulate the political environment to their own benefit, making it more likely that they will be victorious in future contests. By winning those elections, they gain the stamp of democratic legitimacy — even for actions that ultimately undermine democratic norms.
一旦掌权，不择手段的领导人有时会为自身利益操纵政治环境，使他们更可能在未来的竞争中获胜。通过赢得这些选举，他们获得了民主合法性的盖章认定——哪怕他们的行为最终破坏了民主规范

Rhetoric aside, the administration has signaled in numerous other ways that Putin’s threats have constrained support for Ukraine. Biden’s foreign policy team speaks of putting up guardrails in the conflict and congratulates themselves on their slow increase in assistance not provoking Mr. Putin. 
然而在言辞之外，拜登政府以许多其他方式表明，普京的威胁限制了对乌克兰的支持。拜登的外交政策团队谈到在冲突中安排好防护措施，并为在不激怒普京的情况下实现缓慢增援而沾沾自喜

Russia’s failure comes from “matching extravagant political aims in Ukraine to meager and inefficiently marshaled means. Tempting as it is to marvel at Russia’s strategic incompetence, we ought to be worried that the grave deficiencies Russia is demonstrating also haunt our own national security strategy. 
俄罗斯的失败源于“给乌克兰问题设定过高的政治目标，却匹配了匮乏和低效的手段”。尽管对俄罗斯的战略无能感到惊叹，但我们应该担心俄罗斯所表现出的严重缺陷也会困扰我们自己的国家安全战略。

These intact forests — from those in the Amazon and Congo River basins to ones in Canada, Russia and Ecuador — are the world’s life-support system. They sponge billions of tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, generating oxygen, filtering freshwater to drink and generally strengthening our resilience against the pressures of climate change.
从亚马孙河和刚果河流域，再到加拿大、俄罗斯和厄瓜多尔，这些原始森林是世界的生命维持系统。它们从大气中吸收数十亿吨二氧化碳，产生氧气，过滤淡水供饮用，并在总体上增强了我们对气候变化压力的适应能力

The brilliance of the Chinese government in the 1980s and 1990s is that they always did things in an experimental fashion, They would tweak things here and there, depending on how things work, Different cities had different battery technologies. Some had hydrogen fuel.
中国政府在上世纪八九十年代的聪明之处就在于，他们总以实验性的方式做事，他们会根据具体情况，在这里或那里做出调整，不同城市有不同的发展模式。有些迎来了突飞猛进

Officials were instructed to stop infections by “killing chickens with a knife for slaughtering cows,” a play on a Chinese idiom, to indicate that overkill was desired. “Act faster, prevent spread and spillover, especially to Beijing,”
官员们接到指示，在防止感染上要采取“杀鸡用牛刀”的力度。“以快制快，防止扩散、外溢，尤其不能外溢到北京，”

So when a hotel employee woke me up a little after 7 a.m. to explain that we were not allowed to step outside for four days, my initial disorientation quickly turned to resignation.On hot days, people wait sometimes for 30 minutes, face masks plastered to their skin by sweat. 
所以，当一名酒店员工在早上7点刚过时将我叫醒，解释说我们四天不准出门时，我最初的迷茫很快变成了无奈。在炎热的天气里，人们有时会等上30分钟，汗水将口罩粘在皮肤上。

Many of these areas seem more pro forma than designed to halt transmission. Some are tents in building lobbies. Some are corners with folding chairs. Near Beijing’s biggest park, one is a roped-off section of open air.
许多这样的隔离区似乎不是为了阻止传播，而是为了形式上的存在。有的是在建筑物大厅撑起帐篷。有的是在角落里放几把折叠椅。在北京最大的公园附近，有一个用绳索圈出来的户外区域。

I’ve been moved, and a little awed, by the ways people have found to plod through the pain. Do not let the prolonged epidemic and the economic downturn make you give up your dreams or lower your expectations,We need to adjust and adapt to the external environment, but not by doing that.
人们在痛苦中艰难前行的样子令我感动，甚至有些敬畏。不要因为疫情的久拖不决与经济的低迷下滑，就放弃自己的梦想，降低自我的期待，我们需要做出调整，也需要适应外部环境，但不是通过放弃梦想与降低期待来实现。

Signs of the slowdown are everywhere. Taxi drivers offer unprompted assessments of how thin traffic is. In the food court near my office in Beijing, many of the stalls have gone dark, leaving diners at the surviving shops to eat in a spooky half-glow.
到处都是经济衰退的迹象。出租车司机会主动感叹车流有多稀疏。在我北京办公室附近的美食广场，许多摊位都已关门，在幸存的店铺中，食客只能在阴森晦暗的环境中用餐。

Surrounded by deferential functionaries,he is already looking well beyond the next five years, trying to build a lasting edifice of power and policies. He is fleshing out his own creed and promoting cohorts of younger protégés, technocrats and military commanders who may advance his influence for decades.
在顺从的职能部门簇拥下，目光并不止于未来五年，他试图建立一个持久的权力与政策大厦。他正在令自己的信条进一步丰满，并提拔一批年轻的门生、技术专家和军事指挥官，这些人可能会在几十年内提升他的影响力

The analyst likened the predominance to “garbage time” in a basketball game: when the score is so lopsided that changes in the team in the final stretch make little difference.Other players may leave the court, and others may go on and even score a beautiful three-pointer, and everyone will cheer,But it won’t affect the outcome.
分析人士将主导地位比作篮球比赛中的“垃圾时间”：当比分差距太大时，球队在最后阶段的换人几乎不会产生什么改变。一些球员可能会离场，另一些可能会继续比赛，甚至投进漂亮的三分球，大家会欢呼，但不会影响结果。

Countries are also being buffeted by macroeconomic forces as central banks around the world raise rates. Many nations took out adjustable-rate loans from China that initially seemed manageable when rates were low — and are now stuck with ballooning payments. More than half the world’s poor countries owe more to China than to all Western governments combined.
随着世界各地的央行纷纷加息，各国也受到宏观经济力量的冲击。许多国家从中国获得了可调整利率的贷款，这些贷款最初在利率低的时候似乎还可以应付，但现在却受不断膨胀的偿还额所困, 世界上一半以上的贫穷国家欠中国的钱比欠所有西方政府的总和还要多。

Washington needs to contemplate the unthinkable: accepting that North Korea is a nuclear state.Successive U.S. administrations have steadfastly refused to do that. It would be a setback for global nonproliferation and send the message that you can defy the international community,and get away with it.
华盛顿需要考虑一种难以想象的情况：接受朝鲜是一个有核国家。连续几届美国政府都坚决拒绝这样做。认为这将让全球防止核扩散的努力受挫，并传递出这样一个信息：可以无视国际社会而不受惩罚

The risk of war has spiked over the past year as the two Koreas engaged in a rhetorical and actual arms race. There is precedent for the United States to finesse the situation. The United States turned a blind eye to India until it conducted a round of tests in 1998. 
在过去一年里，随着朝韩展开口头上和实际行动上的军备竞赛，战争爆发的风险急剧上升。美国有巧妙处理这种情况的先例。美国曾对印度的核武器项目睁一只眼闭一只眼，直到1998年印度进行了一轮核试验。

Although Israel has never acknowledged its nuclear capability, it remains the worst-kept secret in the world. But it does not openly flaunt its capability, which made it much easier for Arab neighbors like Egypt not to pursue their own nuclear programs in response. 
虽然以色列从未承认自己拥核，但那是天下皆知的秘密。以色列从不公开炫耀自己的能力，这更便于埃及等阿拉伯邻国不用以发展核项目作为回应。

China was using supercomputing and artificial intelligence to develop stealth and hypersonic weapons systems, and to try to crack the U.S. government’s most encrypted messaging,The administration’s concerns about China’s tech ambitions culminated last week in the unveiling of the most stringent controls by the U.S. government on technology exports to the country in decades — an opening salvo that would ripple through global commerce and could frustrate other governments and companies outside China.
中国正在利用超级计算和人工智能开发隐形和高超音速武器系统，并试图破解美国政府加密等级最高的通讯,政府对中国科技野心的担忧在上周达到顶峰，美国政府公布了几十年来对中国技术出口最严格的控制措施。这波初始攻势将波及全球商业，并可能引起其他政府和中国以外的公司的不满。

Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, talked about a “small yard, high fence” for critical technologies.Choke points for foundational technologies have to be inside that yard, and the fence has to be high because these competitors should not be able to exploit American and allied technologies to undermine American and allied security
在周三有关政府国家安全战略的演讲中，国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文谈到要为关键技术设置“小院子、高围栏”。基础技术的关键点必须在这个院子里，围栏必须很高，因为竞争者不应该能够利用美国及其盟友的技术来破坏美国及其盟友的安全

Some companies have chafed at the idea of losing sales in a lucrative market. the U.S. restrictions a significant step aimed at sabotaging their country’s development.Sanctions that put the United States at odds with its allies and partners today will both undercut their effectiveness and make it harder to enroll a broad coalition of states in U.S. deterrence efforts
一些公司对于可能失去一个利润丰厚的市场感到恼火。美国的限制措施是旨在破坏中国发展的重大举措。如今让美国与其盟友和合作伙伴产生分歧的制裁不仅会削弱制裁的效力，也很难让更多国家参与到美国的威慑努力中来。

This mission has been in the making ever since the depredations China suffered at the hands of Western nations in the 19th and 20th centuries, followed by the collapse of Chinese imperial rule in 1912 and Japan’s savage wartime invasion. The Communist Party picked up the pieces of a broken nation，wiping away those past shames, restoring China’s strength and control over “lost” territories like Taiwan. 
自从中国在19世纪和20世纪遭受西方列强的掠夺，以及1912年帝制的崩溃和日本野蛮入侵以来，这个使命就一直在酝酿之中。中共解决了国家山河破碎的问题。消除过去的耻辱，恢复国力，收复台湾等“失落”的领土。

Corrupt local officials governed their turf like petty tyrants, and protests raged over government heavy-handedness, rampant corruption, poor labor conditions and colossal pollution.
腐败的地方官员们像小暴君那样统治着自己的地盘，政府的高压手段、猖獗的腐败、恶劣的劳动条件、巨大的环境污染问题引发了激烈的抗议。

Judging from the current situation, the economy rebounded significantly in the third quarter — from a global perspective, China’s economic performance is still outstanding,China’s economic stabilization and improvement will be further consolidated.
从目前掌握的情况看，三季度经济明显回升。从全球范围看，中国经济表现也依然突出，中国经济回稳向好的态势必将进一步巩固。

They lounge in folding chairs, perch on traffic bollards or pace small circles to keep warm. They are stationed every 100 feet or so, keeping watch over their designated patch of Beijing street. Their bright red wind-breakers and matching armbands spell out their roles as “Neighborhood Security Volunteers.”
他们坐在折叠椅上，靠着交通指示灯柱，或是绕圈走动取暖。每隔30米左右就有他们在站岗，监视着他们所负责的北京街道。他们鲜红色的防风衣和配套的袖章表明了他们的身份——“社区治安志愿者”。

Foreign nationals flocked to live, study and work in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Beijing; well-to-do American parents boasted of enrolling their children in Mandarin immersion classes. The power to coerce, as the political scientist Joseph Nye famously observed, is not the same as the power to attract.
外国公民蜂拥而至，在上海、香港和北京生活、学习和工作；富裕的美国父母炫耀他们的孩子参加了沉浸式普通话班。正如政治学家约瑟夫·奈著名的观察，胁迫的力量与吸引的力量是不一样的。

China seemed to offer a unique model of capitalist dynamism and authoritarian efficacy. Decisions were made; things got done: What a contrast with the increasingly sclerotic free world.
中国似乎提供了一个独特的资本主义活力和威权主义效能相结合的模式。决策一旦做出，事情就可以完成。这与日益僵化的自由世界形成了鲜明的对比。

Local officials plowed money into the highways, ports and power plants that manufacturers needed, turning China into the world’s factory. Under Mr. Xi, government priorities have shifted toward self-sufficiency and the use of industrial robots, something that Chinese leaders believe is critical to escaping the middle-income trap, in which a country can no longer compete in low-wage manufacturing because of rising wages but has not yet made the leap to the value-added products of high-income countries.
多年来，首要任务是经济增长。地方官员将资金投入到制造商需要的高速公路、港口和发电厂，将中国变成世界工厂。在习近平的领导下，政府的优先事项已转向自给自足和使用工业机器人，中国领导人认为这是摆脱中等收入陷阱的关键——如果落入这个陷阱，由于工资上涨，一个国家无法在低工资制造业中竞争，又无法实现向高收入国家的增值产品的飞跃。

But the Cultural Revolution shattered that sheltered life; he was sent to a remote village for seven years, where he did hard labor and slept in a hillside cave home. As a result, he can claim a familiarity with rural people and rural problems that few world leaders can even imagine.
但文化大革命打破了这种受保护的生活；他被送到一个偏远的村庄，做了七年苦工，睡在窑洞里。因此可以说，他对农民和农村问题的熟悉程度是其他世界领导人几乎无法想象的。

For the past quarter century, China was run by a well-oiled government bureaucracy that predictably focused on the economy as its top priority.That may no longer be the case. exporters exaggerate the value of their shipments to customs officials as part of complex strategies to move money out of China.
过去25年里，中国是由一个运转顺畅的政府官僚机构管理，它不出预料地把发展经济作为首要任务。情况也许不再如此。出口商向海关官员夸大了他们出口货物的报价，这是他们将资金转移出中国的复杂办法的一部分。

Share prices rose sharply in Hong Kong as a change in British tax policy preceded a global rally in stock markets. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, more insulated from international events and also heavily managed by the Chinese authorities, were little changed.
香港的股市大幅上涨，因为英国取消减税措施的决定已引发了全球股市的反弹。上海和深圳的股市几乎没有变化，因为受中国当局严格管理的大陆股市更少受国际事件的影响。

He reiterated those goals in typically grandiose language this week. (“We must uphold and act on the principle that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets.”) 
本周，他以典型的宏大语言重申了这些目标。（“必须牢固树立和践行绿水青山就是金山银山的理念。”）

With all its steel and cement plants, coal-fired power stations and power-guzzling factories, China is by far the biggest emitter of planet-warming gases today.
由于众多的钢铁和水泥厂、燃煤发电站和耗电量巨大的工厂，中国是全球最大排放国，温室气体排放量远超其它国家。

This summer, China sweltered through more than two months of record-high temperatures, the country’s most prolonged heat wave since modern records began in 1961. The Yangtze River dried to a trickle. Factories halted production to reduce the burden on power grids.Last year, the catastrophe was the opposite: People drowned in subway cars as torrential summer rain flooded tunnels in the inland metropolis of Zhengzhou.
今年夏天，中国经历了两个多月的创纪录高温，这是该国自1961年有现代记录以来持续时间最长的热浪。长江干涸，水位急剧下降。工厂停产以减轻电网负担。去年的灾难恰恰相反：内陆大都市郑州的夏季暴雨淹没了隧道，有人淹死在地铁车厢里。

Be mindful of dangers in the midst of peace,Get the house in good repair before rain comes, and prepare to undergo the major tests of high winds and waves, and even perilous, stormy seas. There’s a broad, stable, near-consensus majority in China now that truly believes the United States has the intention to disrupt China’s modernization drive.
居安思危，未雨绸缪，准备经受风高浪急甚至惊涛骇浪的重大考验. 中国现在大多数人中有一种广泛、稳定、近乎一致的共识，他们对美国有意破坏中国的现代化进程确信无疑。

Threats exist everywhere — not just enemies at the border, but in subversive ideas in classrooms and museums.The systems for safeguarding national security were inadequate,National security is the foundation of national rejuvenation.
威胁无处不在，不仅来自境外的敌人，还来自教室里和博物馆里的颠覆性思想。维护国家安全的制度不健全，国家安全是民族复兴的根基。

It is critical to resist fatalism and maintain a healthy dose of skepticism against dire assessments that could become self-fulfilling. If a peaceful — if competitive — coexistence is the ultimate objective, Washington and Beijing do not need to knock each other out to win.
关键是要抵制宿命论，不要轻易做出时局已不可挽回的判断，那样的判断可能会成为一种自证预言。如果和平共处——即便仍不乏竞争——是最终目标，华盛顿和北京就不需要争个你死我活。

These days, it is a magnet for international interest.Around the world, the Biden administration has also been trying to gather allies to deter Beijing, with a clear and oft-repeated message.One China,” with Taiwan, is Beijing’s policy — a policy the United States and most countries honor in word if not in deed.
如今，台湾是个吸引国际兴趣的地方。在世界各地，拜登政府一直在试图为威慑北京而用一个反复提及的明确信息召集盟友。台湾属于“一个中国”是北京的政策，美国和大多数国家也在口头上尊重这个政策，但在行动上并不一定如此。

Our country has entered a period when strategic opportunity coexists with risks and challenges, and uncertainties and unforeseen factors are rising,the world has entered a period of turbulence and transformation.This marks a meaningful, and perhaps major, shift in their assessment of the global order,He’s basically hardening the system because the likelihood of conflict is going up.
我国发展进入战略机遇和风险挑战并存、不确定难预料因素增多的时期，世界已进入动荡变革时期。这标志着他们对国际秩序的评估发生了一个意味深长的，或许十分重要的改变，他基本上是在强化这个体系，因为存在冲突加剧的可能

I solemnly promise that I will treat comrades honestly and will never act like a patriarch who calls all the shots
我郑重承诺，我一定真诚对待同志，决不搞一言堂、家长制

China remained heavily dependent on state-led, debt-fueled construction of road, bridges, rail lines and other infrastructure.That data showed continued strength in exports and a sharp expansion of the trade surplus as imports were little changed.
中国仍然严重依赖国家主导的、由债务推动的公路、桥梁、铁路线和其他基础设施建设。数据显示出口持续强劲，由于进口几乎没有变化，贸易顺差急剧扩大。

I sympathize with the president. People were really hurting from $5- and $6-a-gallon gasoline. Crucially, the sanctions also ban E.U. companies from providing shipping insurance, brokering services or financing for oil exports from Russia to third countries.
我理解总统的处境。因为五、六美元一加仑的汽油正在对人们造成不小的痛苦。至关重要的是，制裁还禁止欧盟公司为俄罗斯向第三国的石油出口提供航运保险、经纪服务或融资。

The beauty for Putin of an energy bomb is that unlike setting off a nuclear bomb — which would unite the whole world against him — setting off an oil price bomb would divide the West from Ukraine. This is not ideal. This is not where I hoped we would be in 2022. But this is where we are, and anything else really is magical thinking 
对普京来说，能源炸弹的美妙之处在于，与引爆核弹不同，后者将使全世界联合起来反对他，引爆油价炸弹会将西方与乌克兰分开。这不是万全之策。这不是我希望我们在2022年会出现的情况。但这就是我们所处的现实，其他的说法都是异想天开

Ringed by barbed wire and high gray walls, and once the site of a secretive military detention center, the museum just south of Taipei makes for a surprising tourist hot spot. Some stopped at a fountain with the statue of Xie Zhi, a mythical, single-horned Chinese beast said to represent justice
这个用铁丝网和灰色高墙围起来的博物馆位于台北南部，这里曾是秘密的军事看守所，如今成了出人意料的热门景点。一些人在獬豸雕塑的喷泉前停了下来，据说在中国神话中，独角兽獬豸代表着正义。

Mr. Johnson’s decision to pull out of the race on Sunday night cleared a path for Mr. Sunak, who had challenged Ms. Truss last summer but lost to her in a vote of the party’s rank-and-file members. It was a head-spinning reversal of fortune for Mr. Sunak,it seemed as if Mr. Sunak’s meteoric ascent had cratered as well.
约翰逊周日晚间决定退出竞选，为苏纳克扫清了道路。去年夏天，苏纳克曾挑战特拉斯，但在党内普通党员的投票中败给了她。对苏纳克来说，这是一次令人头晕目眩的命运转折。苏纳克的平步青云似乎也遇到挫折。

They need someone regular in charge — someone who knows what it’s really like out here, rather than looking down from the 26th floor, It’s survival of the fittest right now, what with everything going up.
他们需要一个中规中矩的人来负责——一个知道外面的真实情况的人，而不是从26楼往下看，什么都涨价，现在到了适者生存的时候。

The second component was a single-minded pursuit of economic growth which, Deng famously declared, would be China’s “hard principle.” Officials throughout China dove headlong into promoting growth at all costs — bringing prosperity but also corruption, inequality and massive industrial pollution.
第二个组成部分是一心一意地抓经济增长，邓小平提出了“发展才是硬道理”的著名说法。中国各地的官员们一头扎进不惜一切代价促经济增长的工作中去，这给中国带来了繁荣，不过也带来了腐败、不平等和大规模工业污染等问题。

National security is the bedrock of national rejuvenation, and social stability is a prerequisite for building a strong and prosperous China. small changes in wording can herald big shifts in ideology and policy. And to his credit, he has confronted serious problems that his predecessors swept under the rug, particularly corruption and economic inequality.
国家安全是民族复兴的根基，社会稳定是国家强盛的前提。措辞的微小变化可能预示着意识形态和政策的重大转变。他在着手解决前任们掩盖起来的严重问题，尤其是腐败和经济不平等。

The Pentagon will also maintain an additional rotational Army brigade in Romania, increase rotational troop deployments in the Baltic countries, deploy two squadrons of F-35 aircraft to Britain, station additional air defense units in Germany and Italy, and seek to increase the number of destroyers stationed in Spain.
五角大楼还将在罗马尼亚额外保留一个轮换的陆军旅，增加在波罗的海国家的轮换部队部署，向英国部署两个F-35飞机中队，在德国和意大利增派防空部队，并寻求增加驻扎在西班牙的驱逐舰。

The Nuclear Posture Review released Thursday retained the Pentagon’s customary language. It said deterring an attack was “the fundamental role,” not the sole purpose, of the weapons. It’s a muddled message,
周四发布的《核态势评估》保留了五角大楼的惯用措辞。它说，对攻击的威慑是武器的“根本作用”，而不是唯一目的。由此传达的讯息是含混不清的

He railed that the Chinese establishment was too beholden to Western ideas and global trade, too content to let China ease into a world order rigged by the United States. But rather than reveling in that success, Mr. Wang has become alarmed by it. Egged on by propaganda, nationalism has become increasingly volatile and vitriolic. Yan Xuetong, an often-hawkish international relations professor, lamented this year that students held an overly confident, “make-believe” mind-set about China’s global stature.
他抱怨中国的当权派太受制于西方思想和全球贸易，太满足于让中国融入由美国控制的世界秩序。但是这种成功没有令王小东陶醉，反而令他产生了警惕。在宣传的煽动下，民族主义已变得愈发易燃易爆。经常持鹰派立场的国际关系学教授阎学通今年曾感叹，学生们对中国的全球地位抱有一种过度自信的“假想”心态。
