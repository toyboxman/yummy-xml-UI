As if to prove their point, German politicians say, Cosco threatened to take its business elsewhere if its bid was turned down. It is the Hamburg port’s biggest client, and already owns stakes in ports in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy. He stressed this week how important China was for the German economy and lamented what he called “the China bashing.”
为了证明观点，德国政界人士表示，中远扬言如果投标被拒绝，就会将其业务转移到别处。中远是汉堡港最大的客户，已经在荷兰、比利时、西班牙和意大利的港口拥有股份. 政界人士强调了中国对德国经济的重要性，并对他所谓的“抹黑中国”表示遗憾。

Exports to China helped lift Germany out of mass unemployment in the early years of her chancellorship, and cushioned the blow of the financial crisis years later. Even before the war in Ukraine, Germany’s China policy was ripe for evolving from the mercantilist soft touch of the Merkel era.
在她担任总理的最初几年，对中国的出口帮助德国摆脱了大规模失业，并缓解了多年后金融危机的打击。甚至在乌克兰战争之前，德国的对华政策就已经可以从默克尔时代的重商主义软性政策中蜕变出来。

We are in a precarious economic situation due to the war, Part of the hesitation is that Scholz doesn’t want to send shock waves into the system. We can’t go on like this. We need a growth model without geopolitical dependencies.
因为战争，我们的经济状况并不稳定，举棋不定的部分原因在于，朔尔茨不想给经济体系带来冲击。我们不能再这样下去了。我们需要拿出摆脱地缘政治依赖的增长模式。

Chinese stocks whipsawed on Monday, in an apparent sign of investors’ unease over tighter grip on the nation. In Hong Kong, two indexes — the benchmark Hang Seng Index and one that tracks Chinese stocks traded in the city — had even wilder swings.
中国股市周一大幅震荡，显示收紧对中国的控制令投资者感到不安。在香港，两个指数——基准恒生指数和一个追踪在香港交易的中国股票的指数——波动幅度甚至更大。
