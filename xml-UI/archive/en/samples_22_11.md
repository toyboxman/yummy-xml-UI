As if to prove their point, German politicians say, Cosco threatened to take its business elsewhere if its bid was turned down. It is the Hamburg port’s biggest client, and already owns stakes in ports in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy. He stressed this week how important China was for the German economy and lamented what he called “the China bashing.”
为了证明观点，德国政界人士表示，中远扬言如果投标被拒绝，就会将其业务转移到别处。中远是汉堡港最大的客户，已经在荷兰、比利时、西班牙和意大利的港口拥有股份. 政界人士强调了中国对德国经济的重要性，并对他所谓的“抹黑中国”表示遗憾。

Exports to China helped lift Germany out of mass unemployment in the early years of her chancellorship, and cushioned the blow of the financial crisis years later. Even before the war in Ukraine, Germany’s China policy was ripe for evolving from the mercantilist soft touch of the Merkel era.
在她担任总理的最初几年，对中国的出口帮助德国摆脱了大规模失业，并缓解了多年后金融危机的打击。甚至在乌克兰战争之前，德国的对华政策就已经可以从默克尔时代的重商主义软性政策中蜕变出来。

We are in a precarious economic situation due to the war, Part of the hesitation is that Scholz doesn’t want to send shock waves into the system. We can’t go on like this. We need a growth model without geopolitical dependencies.
因为战争，我们的经济状况并不稳定，举棋不定的部分原因在于，朔尔茨不想给经济体系带来冲击。我们不能再这样下去了。我们需要拿出摆脱地缘政治依赖的增长模式。

Chinese stocks whipsawed on Monday, in an apparent sign of investors’ unease over tighter grip on the nation. In Hong Kong, two indexes — the benchmark Hang Seng Index and one that tracks Chinese stocks traded in the city — had even wilder swings.
中国股市周一大幅震荡，显示收紧对中国的控制令投资者感到不安。在香港，两个指数——基准恒生指数和一个追踪在香港交易的中国股票的指数——波动幅度甚至更大。

Affirmative action is on trial again. This time, opponents of race-conscious college admission practices are claiming that Asian Americans are hurt by it. The plaintiffs in Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College, which presented oral arguments before the Supreme Court on Monday, allege that Harvard holds Asian American applicants to higher academic standards and rates them lower than other students on personal characteristics, such as fit, courage and likability. The proposed solution is to abandon race as a factor in admissions decisions.
平权行动再次面临裁决。这一次，反对大学招生带入种族意识的人声称，亚裔因此受到了伤害。周一，学生公平录取组织诉哈佛学院校长与教职员案的原告向最高法院提交了口头陈述，称哈佛对亚裔申请者的学术标准要求更高，而在体格、胆略和受欢迎程度等个人特征上，亚裔的评分低于其他学生。提出的解决方案是放弃将种族作为录取决定的考量因素。

Was it the demented attempt by Vladimir Putin to wipe Ukraine off the map, which has decoupled Russia from the West — what I call Ruxit — creating havoc with worldwide energy and food markets? Was it the near-total infection of the G.O.P. with Donald Trump’s Big Lie that the 2020 election was stolen — Trumpit — which is eroding our democracy’s most cherished asset: our ability to peacefully and legitimately transfer power?
是普京想把乌克兰从地图上抹去的疯狂尝试，让俄罗斯与西方脱钩（我称之为Ruxit），给全球能源和粮食市场造成了严重破坏吗？是特朗普关于2020年大选被窃取的弥天大谎——特朗普脱钩(Trumpit)——几乎完全感染了共和党，侵蚀了我们民主最宝贵的资产：我们和平、合法转移权力的能力吗？

We’ve had four decades of U.S.-China economic integration that hugely benefited American consumers. It led to new export opportunities for some Americans and unemployment for others, depending on the industry they were in. It helped raise hundreds of millions of Chinese out of extreme poverty. It tamped down inflation and worked to prevent any great power wars. On the whole, we will miss that era now that it’s gone, because our world will be less prosperous, less integrated and less geopolitically stable.
40年来，美中经济一体化极大地造福了美国消费者。它给一些美国人带来了新的出口机会，也给另一些人带来了失业，具体取决于他们所在的行业。它帮助数亿中国人摆脱了极度贫困。它抑制了通货膨胀，并努力防止任何大国战争的发生。总的来说，我们会怀念那个已经逝去的时代，因为我们的世界将变得不那么繁荣，不那么一体化，地缘政治也不那么稳定

We’ve never been comfortable with Beijing’s rising challenge, especially because China was not propelled by oil but by its savings, hard work and homework — i.e., a willingness to sacrifice to achieve national greatness, with a strong emphasis on education and science. That used to be us. We have to assume that China is setting itself apart from other countries and will build a counter-model to the liberal, market-oriented model of the West.
来自北京的挑战日渐加剧，对此我们从来都是不自在的，特别是因为中国的动力不是石油，而是它的储蓄、辛勤努力和家庭作业——也就是说，愿意付出牺牲，以此实现国家的伟大，并强调教育和科学。我们曾经就是这样。我们不得不假设中国正在将自己与其他国家区分开来，并将建立一个与西方自由的、以市场为导向的模式相对立的模式

But the last trend may be the most off-putting: Instead of importing effective Western-made vaccines to keep the pandemic at bay, China is relying on a “zero Covid” policy that uses lockdowns of whole cities as well as all the new tools of a surveillance state: drones, facial recognition, ubiquitous closed-circuit television cameras, cellphone tracking and even tracking of restaurant patrons, who must present a QR code to be scanned and recorded.
但最后一个趋势可能是最令人不舒服的：中国没有进口有效的西方制造的疫苗来遏制大流行，而是依赖于“清零”政策，将整个城市封锁，并利用监控国家拥有的所有新工具：无人机、面部识别、无处不在的闭路监视镜头、手机跟踪甚至跟踪餐厅的食客——他们必须出示二维码，被扫描和记录。

The belief that China can be the best at everything alone is like believing that China’s basketball team can always defeat the world’s all-star basketball team. Color me dubious. But also color me worried. 
相信中国可以在任何事情上都做到最好，那就像是相信中国篮球队总能击败世界全明星篮球队。我很怀疑。但我也担心。

That was in one sense unsurprising, as educational diversity has for decades been the sole justification accepted by the Supreme Court for allowing what it has said the Constitution and a federal law would otherwise forbid: taking account of race in admissions decisions. Diversity is the last man standing. But it is a murky and contested concept, opaque by design and an anodyne way to confront the combustible topic of race. 
从某种意义上说，这并不令人意外，因为几十年来，教育多元一直是最高法院接受的允许种族考虑的唯一理由，尽管宪法和一部联邦法律禁止在录取决定中考虑种族。坚持到最后的只剩多元。但这是一个晦涩且有争议的概念，带着有意的含糊其辞，也是一种应对种族敏感话题的缓和手法。

If you are broadly aware that the upcoming midterm elections in the United States have major global implications, but you’re not up to speed on the American system of government or you’re having trouble following along, you’re in the right place.
如果你大致上知道即将到来的美国中期选举将对全球产生重大影响，但对美国的政府制度并不了解，或者觉得难以跟上进度，看这篇文章就对了。

The Senate, which is now at a 50-50 deadlock but is controlled by Democrats because Vice President Kamala Harris casts the tiebreaking vote, has 100 members, with two from each of the 50 states. Not all 100 senators are up for re-election at once. This year, there are 34 seats up for grabs, and winners serve six-year terms. The odds are against Democrats
参议院目前处于五五开的僵局，但由民主党控制，因为副总统卡玛拉·哈里斯可以投下打破僵局的一票。参议院有100名议员，50个州中，每州各有两名。并不是所有100名参议员都要同时竞选连任。今年有34个席位需要竞选，获胜者的任期为六年。民主党的胜算不大

You’ve got far better odds of winning the lottery” than of being hit by part of the rocket. The odds of being hit by this falling rocket are zero. “The risk to an individual is six per 10 trillion. That’s a really small number.” He puts the odds that all of the nearly eight billion people on Earth will survive unscathed at 99.5 percent. NASA officials said on Thursday that its trajectory was designed to re-enter not long after launch in a specific unpopulated area.
比起被这枚火箭的一部分击中，“你中彩票的几率要高得多".被这枚坠落火箭击中的几率为零。“个人面临的风险是10万亿分之六。这是个非常小的数字。” 他认为，地球上近80亿人都安然无恙的几率为99.5%。美国宇航局官员周四表示，其轨迹按照设计会在发射后不久再入，落入一个具体的无人区域。

Instead, the booster gradually falls as it rubs against the wisps of the upper atmosphere. How fast it falls depends on the air density. That varies, because the Earth’s atmosphere puffs outward when the sun is active, spewing out more charged particles, and contracts when the sun is quieter.
相反，助推器会在与上层大气的缕缕摩擦中逐渐下落。其下落速度取决于空气密度。数据会有变动，因为地球大气层会在太阳活跃时向外膨胀，喷出更多带电粒子，太阳不活跃时则会收缩。

China is poised to take advantage of the global urgency to tackle climate change. It is the world’s dominant manufacturer and user of solar panels and wind turbines. It leads the world in producing energy from hydroelectric dams and is building more nuclear power plants than any other country.
中国已经准备好利用应对气候变化的全球紧迫性。该国是世界上太阳能组件和风力涡轮发电机的主要制造者和使用者，在水力发电方面领先世界，也在建造比任何国家都多的核电站。

The country has long viewed coal, which it has in abundance, as the best way to avoid becoming overly dependent on foreign energy suppliers and remaining susceptible to unpredictable weather, like droughts that reduce the output of hydroelectric dams. In no country are the climate stakes higher than they are in China. 
中国煤炭储量丰富，长期以来一直将煤炭视为避免过度依赖从外国进口能源，以及预防天气造成的不可预测影响（比如干旱导致水电站发电量减少）的最佳办法. 在气候变化问题上，没有比中国更加利害攸关的国家了。

Adding some 200-plus gigawatts of coal over the last five years, and now another 200 or so coming online in the planning stage, if it went to fruition would actually undo the ability of the rest of the world to achieve a limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius in global temperature increases.
在过去五年里增加了约200多吉瓦的燃煤发电装机容量，现在又有200多吉瓦的燃煤发电装机容量在规划阶段，如果全部完成的话，这实际上将挫败世界其他地方实现（把全球气温上升）控制在1.5摄氏度以内的能力

The administrative region of Beijing covers an area the size of Connecticut, from broad wheat fields on the plains to the southeast to brush-covered mountain ranges topped with the Great Wall to the north.
北京行政区域的面积相当于康涅狄格州的面积，东南部是宽广的麦田，西北部是灌木丛生的山峦，山脊上有长城。

But just in case the weather turns very hot or very cold, raising electricity demand, or if renewable energy slackens, Beijing has not given up on coal. The enormous Huaneng thermal power plant in the city’s southeast sits ready to fire up four coal-fired units each taller than a 10-story apartment tower.
但为了防止天气变得太热或太冷，导致电力需求大增，或可再生能源供应不足，北京也没有放弃煤电。华能集团在北京东南部有一个大型火电厂，随时准备着启动四个燃煤机组，每个机组都比10层公寓楼还要高。

Russia has been eager to build Power of Siberia 2, which could supply a tenth of China’s gas needs. But China appears to be stalling, and is mulling whether to deepen its energy relationship with Moscow. China has consistently sought diversity of supply and long-term, low-cost contracts.
俄罗斯一直很想建设“西伯利亚力量二号”管道项目，这条管道可满足中国十分之一的天然气需求。但中国似乎在故意拖延，并在考虑是否要深化与莫斯科的能源关系。寻求能源供应的多样化和低价格的长期合同是中国的一贯做法。
