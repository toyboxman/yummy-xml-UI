As if to prove their point, German politicians say, Cosco threatened to take its business elsewhere if its bid was turned down. It is the Hamburg port’s biggest client, and already owns stakes in ports in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy. He stressed this week how important China was for the German economy and lamented what he called “the China bashing.”
为了证明观点，德国政界人士表示，中远扬言如果投标被拒绝，就会将其业务转移到别处。中远是汉堡港最大的客户，已经在荷兰、比利时、西班牙和意大利的港口拥有股份. 政界人士强调了中国对德国经济的重要性，并对他所谓的“抹黑中国”表示遗憾。

Exports to China helped lift Germany out of mass unemployment in the early years of her chancellorship, and cushioned the blow of the financial crisis years later. Even before the war in Ukraine, Germany’s China policy was ripe for evolving from the mercantilist soft touch of the Merkel era.
在她担任总理的最初几年，对中国的出口帮助德国摆脱了大规模失业，并缓解了多年后金融危机的打击。甚至在乌克兰战争之前，德国的对华政策就已经可以从默克尔时代的重商主义软性政策中蜕变出来。

We are in a precarious economic situation due to the war, Part of the hesitation is that Scholz doesn’t want to send shock waves into the system. We can’t go on like this. We need a growth model without geopolitical dependencies.
因为战争，我们的经济状况并不稳定，举棋不定的部分原因在于，朔尔茨不想给经济体系带来冲击。我们不能再这样下去了。我们需要拿出摆脱地缘政治依赖的增长模式。

Chinese stocks whipsawed on Monday, in an apparent sign of investors’ unease over tighter grip on the nation. In Hong Kong, two indexes — the benchmark Hang Seng Index and one that tracks Chinese stocks traded in the city — had even wilder swings.
中国股市周一大幅震荡，显示收紧对中国的控制令投资者感到不安。在香港，两个指数——基准恒生指数和一个追踪在香港交易的中国股票的指数——波动幅度甚至更大。

Affirmative action is on trial again. This time, opponents of race-conscious college admission practices are claiming that Asian Americans are hurt by it. The plaintiffs in Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College, which presented oral arguments before the Supreme Court on Monday, allege that Harvard holds Asian American applicants to higher academic standards and rates them lower than other students on personal characteristics, such as fit, courage and likability. The proposed solution is to abandon race as a factor in admissions decisions.
平权行动再次面临裁决。这一次，反对大学招生带入种族意识的人声称，亚裔因此受到了伤害。周一，学生公平录取组织诉哈佛学院校长与教职员案的原告向最高法院提交了口头陈述，称哈佛对亚裔申请者的学术标准要求更高，而在体格、胆略和受欢迎程度等个人特征上，亚裔的评分低于其他学生。提出的解决方案是放弃将种族作为录取决定的考量因素。

Was it the demented attempt by Vladimir Putin to wipe Ukraine off the map, which has decoupled Russia from the West — what I call Ruxit — creating havoc with worldwide energy and food markets? Was it the near-total infection of the G.O.P. with Donald Trump’s Big Lie that the 2020 election was stolen — Trumpit — which is eroding our democracy’s most cherished asset: our ability to peacefully and legitimately transfer power?
是普京想把乌克兰从地图上抹去的疯狂尝试，让俄罗斯与西方脱钩（我称之为Ruxit），给全球能源和粮食市场造成了严重破坏吗？是特朗普关于2020年大选被窃取的弥天大谎——特朗普脱钩(Trumpit)——几乎完全感染了共和党，侵蚀了我们民主最宝贵的资产：我们和平、合法转移权力的能力吗？

We’ve had four decades of U.S.-China economic integration that hugely benefited American consumers. It led to new export opportunities for some Americans and unemployment for others, depending on the industry they were in. It helped raise hundreds of millions of Chinese out of extreme poverty. It tamped down inflation and worked to prevent any great power wars. On the whole, we will miss that era now that it’s gone, because our world will be less prosperous, less integrated and less geopolitically stable.
40年来，美中经济一体化极大地造福了美国消费者。它给一些美国人带来了新的出口机会，也给另一些人带来了失业，具体取决于他们所在的行业。它帮助数亿中国人摆脱了极度贫困。它抑制了通货膨胀，并努力防止任何大国战争的发生。总的来说，我们会怀念那个已经逝去的时代，因为我们的世界将变得不那么繁荣，不那么一体化，地缘政治也不那么稳定

We’ve never been comfortable with Beijing’s rising challenge, especially because China was not propelled by oil but by its savings, hard work and homework — i.e., a willingness to sacrifice to achieve national greatness, with a strong emphasis on education and science. That used to be us. We have to assume that China is setting itself apart from other countries and will build a counter-model to the liberal, market-oriented model of the West.
来自北京的挑战日渐加剧，对此我们从来都是不自在的，特别是因为中国的动力不是石油，而是它的储蓄、辛勤努力和家庭作业——也就是说，愿意付出牺牲，以此实现国家的伟大，并强调教育和科学。我们曾经就是这样。我们不得不假设中国正在将自己与其他国家区分开来，并将建立一个与西方自由的、以市场为导向的模式相对立的模式

But the last trend may be the most off-putting: Instead of importing effective Western-made vaccines to keep the pandemic at bay, China is relying on a “zero Covid” policy that uses lockdowns of whole cities as well as all the new tools of a surveillance state: drones, facial recognition, ubiquitous closed-circuit television cameras, cellphone tracking and even tracking of restaurant patrons, who must present a QR code to be scanned and recorded.
但最后一个趋势可能是最令人不舒服的：中国没有进口有效的西方制造的疫苗来遏制大流行，而是依赖于“清零”政策，将整个城市封锁，并利用监控国家拥有的所有新工具：无人机、面部识别、无处不在的闭路监视镜头、手机跟踪甚至跟踪餐厅的食客——他们必须出示二维码，被扫描和记录。

The belief that China can be the best at everything alone is like believing that China’s basketball team can always defeat the world’s all-star basketball team. Color me dubious. But also color me worried. 
相信中国可以在任何事情上都做到最好，那就像是相信中国篮球队总能击败世界全明星篮球队。我很怀疑。但我也担心。

That was in one sense unsurprising, as educational diversity has for decades been the sole justification accepted by the Supreme Court for allowing what it has said the Constitution and a federal law would otherwise forbid: taking account of race in admissions decisions. Diversity is the last man standing. But it is a murky and contested concept, opaque by design and an anodyne way to confront the combustible topic of race. 
从某种意义上说，这并不令人意外，因为几十年来，教育多元一直是最高法院接受的允许种族考虑的唯一理由，尽管宪法和一部联邦法律禁止在录取决定中考虑种族。坚持到最后的只剩多元。但这是一个晦涩且有争议的概念，带着有意的含糊其辞，也是一种应对种族敏感话题的缓和手法。

If you are broadly aware that the upcoming midterm elections in the United States have major global implications, but you’re not up to speed on the American system of government or you’re having trouble following along, you’re in the right place.
如果你大致上知道即将到来的美国中期选举将对全球产生重大影响，但对美国的政府制度并不了解，或者觉得难以跟上进度，看这篇文章就对了。

The Senate, which is now at a 50-50 deadlock but is controlled by Democrats because Vice President Kamala Harris casts the tiebreaking vote, has 100 members, with two from each of the 50 states. Not all 100 senators are up for re-election at once. This year, there are 34 seats up for grabs, and winners serve six-year terms. The odds are against Democrats
参议院目前处于五五开的僵局，但由民主党控制，因为副总统卡玛拉·哈里斯可以投下打破僵局的一票。参议院有100名议员，50个州中，每州各有两名。并不是所有100名参议员都要同时竞选连任。今年有34个席位需要竞选，获胜者的任期为六年。民主党的胜算不大

You’ve got far better odds of winning the lottery” than of being hit by part of the rocket. The odds of being hit by this falling rocket are zero. “The risk to an individual is six per 10 trillion. That’s a really small number.” He puts the odds that all of the nearly eight billion people on Earth will survive unscathed at 99.5 percent. NASA officials said on Thursday that its trajectory was designed to re-enter not long after launch in a specific unpopulated area.
比起被这枚火箭的一部分击中，“你中彩票的几率要高得多".被这枚坠落火箭击中的几率为零。“个人面临的风险是10万亿分之六。这是个非常小的数字。” 他认为，地球上近80亿人都安然无恙的几率为99.5%。美国宇航局官员周四表示，其轨迹按照设计会在发射后不久再入，落入一个具体的无人区域。

Instead, the booster gradually falls as it rubs against the wisps of the upper atmosphere. How fast it falls depends on the air density. That varies, because the Earth’s atmosphere puffs outward when the sun is active, spewing out more charged particles, and contracts when the sun is quieter.
相反，助推器会在与上层大气的缕缕摩擦中逐渐下落。其下落速度取决于空气密度。数据会有变动，因为地球大气层会在太阳活跃时向外膨胀，喷出更多带电粒子，太阳不活跃时则会收缩。

China is poised to take advantage of the global urgency to tackle climate change. It is the world’s dominant manufacturer and user of solar panels and wind turbines. It leads the world in producing energy from hydroelectric dams and is building more nuclear power plants than any other country.
中国已经准备好利用应对气候变化的全球紧迫性。该国是世界上太阳能组件和风力涡轮发电机的主要制造者和使用者，在水力发电方面领先世界，也在建造比任何国家都多的核电站。

The country has long viewed coal, which it has in abundance, as the best way to avoid becoming overly dependent on foreign energy suppliers and remaining susceptible to unpredictable weather, like droughts that reduce the output of hydroelectric dams. In no country are the climate stakes higher than they are in China. 
中国煤炭储量丰富，长期以来一直将煤炭视为避免过度依赖从外国进口能源，以及预防天气造成的不可预测影响（比如干旱导致水电站发电量减少）的最佳办法. 在气候变化问题上，没有比中国更加利害攸关的国家了。

Adding some 200-plus gigawatts of coal over the last five years, and now another 200 or so coming online in the planning stage, if it went to fruition would actually undo the ability of the rest of the world to achieve a limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius in global temperature increases.
在过去五年里增加了约200多吉瓦的燃煤发电装机容量，现在又有200多吉瓦的燃煤发电装机容量在规划阶段，如果全部完成的话，这实际上将挫败世界其他地方实现（把全球气温上升）控制在1.5摄氏度以内的能力

The administrative region of Beijing covers an area the size of Connecticut, from broad wheat fields on the plains to the southeast to brush-covered mountain ranges topped with the Great Wall to the north.
北京行政区域的面积相当于康涅狄格州的面积，东南部是宽广的麦田，西北部是灌木丛生的山峦，山脊上有长城。

But just in case the weather turns very hot or very cold, raising electricity demand, or if renewable energy slackens, Beijing has not given up on coal. The enormous Huaneng thermal power plant in the city’s southeast sits ready to fire up four coal-fired units each taller than a 10-story apartment tower.
但为了防止天气变得太热或太冷，导致电力需求大增，或可再生能源供应不足，北京也没有放弃煤电。华能集团在北京东南部有一个大型火电厂，随时准备着启动四个燃煤机组，每个机组都比10层公寓楼还要高。

Russia has been eager to build Power of Siberia 2, which could supply a tenth of China’s gas needs. But China appears to be stalling, and is mulling whether to deepen its energy relationship with Moscow. China has consistently sought diversity of supply and long-term, low-cost contracts.
俄罗斯一直很想建设“西伯利亚力量二号”管道项目，这条管道可满足中国十分之一的天然气需求。但中国似乎在故意拖延，并在考虑是否要深化与莫斯科的能源关系。寻求能源供应的多样化和低价格的长期合同是中国的一贯做法。

These tech entrepreneurs mostly grew up “in the age of ‘economism,’ when money making, economic principles and economic rationality trumped everything else,Now they see the regime puts politics in command,For them, this is incomprehensible.
这些科技领域的企业家大多是“在‘经济主义’时代成长起来的，那时候，赚钱、经济原则和经济理性胜过一切”，现在他们看到这个政权把政治放在首位。对他们来说，这不可理解。

When the ability to govern decreases, even in the absence of any particular policy from the top, the ineptitude, brutality, and ignorance of lower-level officials will brew disasters for the common people they rule over
治理能力削弱后，不用上边有什么很恶的政策，下边官员的无能、蛮横、无知，就会酿造各种直接关系到他们治下的老百姓的灾难

He stood, knelt and bowed twice, performing a traditional Korean ritual for the dead.Day after day, such tributes arrived at the makeshift memorial in Itaewon, one of Seoul’s most popular districts. 
他肃立，跪下，伏地叩首两次，这是韩国祭奠死者的传统仪式。连日来，人们纷纷前往梨泰院，在这样的临时纪念地表示悼念。

The incident came to light when a video of the boy receiving CPR circulated on social media. The police later said that “improper use” of a liquefied gas stove had caused a carbon monoxide leak.
男孩接受心肺复苏术的视频在社交媒体流传后，事件逐渐为人所知。警方后来说，液化气炉的“使用不当”导致一氧化碳泄漏。

Most of the bunkers were mapped out and built by Japan, which governed Taiwan from 1895 until the end of World War II, when Keelung was a bombing target. The shelters around Ms. Shi’s shop occupy one of the oldest parts of the city, sitting just below a hillside park that is being upgraded with an elevator. One of its entrances will soon require a short stroll through a cave with winding tunnels that, until recently, had been used as a fire department storage shed.
大部分掩体是由日本规划并建造的，日本从1895年开始统治台湾，直到“二战”结束。基隆在“二战”中是一个轰炸目标。石惠华店铺周围的防空洞位于这座城市最古老的区域之一，坐落在一个位于山坡上公园的下方，该公园正在加设电梯。不久后，进入公园的其中一个入口将需要穿过一个有着蜿蜒隧道的洞穴，那里不久前还是消防部门的储藏室。

On a recent morning, it looked more like an art gallery or a nightclub. Rails of lights hugged the moist walls, shining on sprouts of green plants, the underground’s only bursts of color. Concrete floors had been laid with drainage areas on the sides. Keelung’s shelters are not easy to manage; deeds are rare, and access often defines possession.
在最近的一个早晨，它看起来更像是一个艺术画廊或夜店。一排排的灯贴着潮湿的墙壁，灯光照在绿色植物的新芽上，成为地下唯一的一抹色彩。地上已经铺好了混凝土，两侧有排水区。基隆的防空洞管理不易；几乎没有地契，使用权通常也决定了所有权。

America was what Taiwan aspired to be. For most of the world, the U.S. midterms are little more than a blip — but they are another data point on what some see as a trend line of trouble. For others, it was Donald J. Trump’s winning the 2016 election while losing the popular vote
美国是台湾渴望学习的榜样。对世界上大多数国家来说，美国的中期选举不过是一个小插曲，但也有一些人认为，这是他们看到的麻烦趋势线的又一个数据点。另一部分人认为问题始于2016年大选，特朗普输掉了公民投票却赢得了选举

In general, democracy has degenerated, it has become useless, It’s become more like anarchy. Unlimited tolerance for everything destroys the foundations of democracy.
总的来说，民主已经退化，变得毫无用处，它变得更像是无政府状态。对一切事物的无限容忍破坏了民主的基础。

Mr. Biden on Wednesday reacted to Democrats’ better-than-expected results, calling Election Day “a good day for democracy,” but others see a worrying structural shift in American political culture that does not bode well. It was Mr. Biden who appears to be a parenthesis in American political culture, not Mr. Trump.
周三，拜登对民主党好于预期的结果做出反应，称选举日“对于民主来说，这是美好的一天”，但也有人认为美国政治文化的结构性转变令人担忧，这不是好兆头。在美国政治文化中，似乎拜登才是插曲，而非特朗普。

The E.U.’s response to Ukraine is a massive undertaking, and while I think the E.U. has done a good job, it does crowd out the possibility of thinking a little bit more strategically about the future — especially in the matters of security and defense.
欧盟对乌克兰的回应是一项庞大的工程，虽然我认为欧盟做得很好，但它确实没有考虑到对未来进行更具战略性思考的可能性——尤其是在安全和国防问题上。

You can hold off moving to Canada. You can forgo the call to the New Zealand Embassy on how to become a citizen there. Tuesday’s election really remains intact. And it looks to have come through — a little dinged up, but OK. The whole U.S. electoral system — in red states and blue — seemed to perform admirably, almost shrugging off the last two years of controversy, diminishing it to what it always was: the shameful fabrication of one man and his most shameless sycophants and imitators. 
你可以暂时不用搬去加拿大。你也可以不用打电话给新西兰大使馆询问如何成为那里的公民。星期二的选举确实完好无损。看起来它通过了测试，虽然有点磨损，但还好。整个美国选举系统——无论是红州还是蓝州——似乎都表现得令人钦佩，几乎摆脱了过去两年的争议，将其还原为它的本来面目：一个人以及他最无耻的谄媚者和模仿者的可耻捏造。

We want a viable center, where we can figure out how to make things happen that can really help people, even if it isn’t perfect or all at once. We don’t want every election to be existential. how do you take that sentiment to scale and make it work in Washington on a regular basis?
我们想要一个靠得住的中心，在那里我们可以思考如何实现一些真正对人们有帮助的事情，即使它不是完美的，也不是很快。我们不希望每一次选举都是生死攸关的事。如何将这种情绪扩大，并使其在华盛顿稳定地发挥作用

In sum, we did not get a clean bill of health. We got a diagnosis that our political white blood cells did OK in beating back the metastasizing infection that threatened to kill our whole electoral system. But that infection is still here, which is why the doctor advised, “Behave in healthy ways, build back your strength and return in 24 months for another scan.”
总而言之，我们没有得到一份干干净净的健康证明。我们得到的诊断是，面对威胁杀死整个选举系统的转移感染，我们的政治白细胞表现还不错。但感染仍然存在，这就是为什么医生建议，“生活方式要健康，恢复强健的体质，24个月后再来做一次扫描。”

An aging president sometimes seen as frail and hobbled by the highest inflation in four decades, an overseas war roiling energy markets and anemic poll numbers somehow overcame expectations anyway — another chapter in Mr. Biden’s lifelong narrative of stubborn resilience in the face of adversity. The results may encourage him to seek re-election and could for now quiet dissenting voices within his party that have been agitating for another standard-bearer in 2024
面对四十年来最严重的通货膨胀 、一场搅动能源市场的海外战争，以及惨淡的民调数据，这位年迈的总统时常给人一种风烛残年的感觉，然而他还是打破了那些预言——拜登的政治生涯以在逆境中的顽强而闻名，此次选举为他的这种顽强续写了新的篇章。这些结果可能会鼓舞他寻求连任，同时也暂时压制了党内呼吁在2024年另觅旗手的声音。

But Mr. Biden may return from his overseas trip to a reality that is less heady than the Democratic exuberance now rippling through the party. Just as ominous for the White House, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the hard-charging firebrand Trump ally set to take over the House Judiciary Committee, would have subpoena power to investigate the Biden administration.
虽然现在民主党内群情激昂，但当拜登从他的海外之行回来后，可能会发现现实没有这么振奋。对白宫来说同样不妙的是，即将接管众议院司法委员会的俄亥俄州众议员吉姆·乔丹将拥有调查拜登政府的传讯权力，而他是个强硬而狂热的特朗普盟友。

If it’s a divided government, maybe something good can come of it, But the historical pattern of bipartisan deal making may be less relevant in an age of extremes. That hardly seems plausible now — either in theory or in practice. The result of a divided government now is more akin to putting armed gladiators in the arena.
如果变成一个分治的政府，也许会成就一些好的东西。但在这个极端时代，两党协商的历史模式可能已经不再那么重要。现在看来，无论是在理论上还是在实践中，这似乎都站不住脚了。现在政府分治的后果更像是将全副武装的角斗士放入竞技场。

As aides envision it, Mr. Biden could spend much of the next two years crisscrossing the country for ribbon-cutting ceremonies. In terms of Biden’s hopes of getting re-elected, he knows from experience that losing a midterm election positions the president to become a counterpuncher, It would help if the Republicans overplayed their hand as they did in those two prior cases.
按照助手们的设想，拜登可能会在未来两年的大部分时间里穿梭于全国各地出席剪彩仪式。就连任希望而言，拜登凭经验也知道，中期选举失利会让总统成为反击者，如果共和党像那两次的情况一样高估自身优势，肯定也会有所帮助。

The lack of visibility into his thinking has left the world trying to divine whether even the smallest signals could indicate the government is fine-tuning its “zero-Covid” policy to limit the harm to the economy. The warning, and China’s latest Covid situation, was described by one analyst as “an absolute gut punch” for the company ahead of the most important holiday season.
由于对他的想法缺乏了解，全世界都在左猜右想，哪怕是最小的信号，是否也能表明政府正在微调“新冠清零”政策，以减少对经济的伤害。按照一名分析师的说法，苹果的警告以及中国最近的疫情形势是对这家公司在最重要的节日季节到来前的“致命一击”。的“致命一击”。

The Chinese financial markets, at times, appear disconnected from reality. Investors hoping for a change in policy are pouncing on any information, often rumors or thinly sourced reports, sending the markets on a roller coaster ride.
中国的金融市场有时似乎与现实脱节。希望政府改变政策的投资者抓住所有的信息（通常是谣言或消息来源不可靠的报道）做交易，这让股市坐上了过山车。

The world has made considerable progress in the past decade to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and by no means are authoritarian leaders alone to blame for the world’s failure to slow warming further. As for Mr. Putin, his invasion of Ukraine could ultimately unravel his grand strategy. Mr. Putin has denied that he leverages his energy resources for geopolitical power and accused the energy-guzzling West of hypocrisy. 
过去十年，世界在减少温室气体排放上取得了相当大的进展。而且，全球未能进一步减缓变暖的问题，不能仅仅归咎于威权领导人。至于普京，他对乌克兰的入侵可能最终会瓦解他的大战略。普京否认了他利用能源资源获取地缘政治权力的说法，并指责能源消耗巨大的西方国家虚伪。

What are friends for if not to lift each other in times of difficulty? China and US announced later that same year a landmark climate cooperation deal that laid the groundwork for the Paris accord. He sees climate as an area for staking China’s global leadership
朋友若不在患难时互相扶持，何以称得上朋友呢？那年晚些时候，中美宣布了一项具有里程碑意义的气候合作协议，为巴黎协议奠定了基础。他认为气候是奠定中国全球领导地位的一个领域。

Mr. Putin’s bet on Asia is impossible without India. Mr. Modi has played that role to his advantage. He created regulations requiring utilities to get a significant chunk of their electricity from renewables. I know that physically he is a very well-built person, he leads an active lifestyle, keeps himself in shape. I’m the same by nature.
没有印度，普京对亚洲的押注是不可能实现的。莫迪充分利用了这一角色。他制定了规定，要求公用事业公司从可再生能源中获得很大一部分电力。我知道他是一个体格健壮的人，他有积极的生活方式，保持着良好的身材。我的天性也是如此。

He gutted environmental protection agencies and stripped their budgets, making it all but impossible to collect fines for illegal deforestation. In his first three years as president alone, Brazil recorded more than 13,000 square miles of deforestation in the Amazon.
他砍掉了了各个环保机构并剥夺其预算，导致几乎没办法对森林非法砍伐征收罚款。仅在他担任总统的头三年里，巴西就有超过3.3万平方公里的亚马孙森林遭到砍伐。

He made clear that he wouldn’t be rushed on getting rid of coal. We will advance initiatives to reach peak carbon emissions in a well-planned and phased way in line with the principle of building the new before discarding the old. Jumping the gun for political reasons, especially populist domestic policies — come on, who does that?
他明确表示不会急于摆脱煤炭。坚持先立后破，有计划分步骤实施碳达峰行动. 因为政治原因就草率行事，特别是那些民粹主义的国内政策——拜托，谁会这么做呢？

Climate TRACE still had “a ways to go” in demonstrating the quality of its data, though she described the project as “exciting.” For power stations, Climate TRACE uses satellite images of the vapor wafting from their chimneys to predict electricity generation. With steel plants, for instance, the group uses satellite measurements of the heat from blast furnaces to estimate steel output.
气候跟踪还“需要做很多工作”证明其数据的质量，不过她形容这是个“激动人心”的项目。对于发电站，他们使用烟囱飘出蒸汽的卫星图片来预测发电量。例如针对钢铁厂，气候跟踪使用卫星测量高炉发出的热量，从而估算出产量。

Winona, a top-selling skin-care brand from Yunnan Province, is selling moisturizing creams and hydrating serums formulated and priced specifically for Chinese buyers. Bosideng, a luxury parka brand, lists goose-feather down jackets that have been given as gifts by Beijing to foreign leaders. 
最畅销护肤品牌是来自云南的薇诺娜，它销售的是专为中国消费者研制、定价的保湿霜和保湿精华液。奢侈派克大衣品牌波司登宣称它的鹅毛羽绒服是中国政府送给外国领导人的礼物

The company threw big galas to drum up interest, flying in stars like Mariah Carey and Taylor Swift to perform. As billions of dollars changed hands, the total was tallied on a mammoth screen projection that ticked inexorably upward. As the gospel of all-out consumption fades, it has been supplanted by themes such as green consumption, rural revitalization and “inclusive economic development”
为了吸引人们的兴趣，阿里举办盛大晚会，邀请玛丽亚·凯莉和泰勒·斯威夫特等明星来中国表演。随着销售额达到上百亿，舞台的巨大屏幕上显示着不停翻新的数字。随着鼓吹竭力消费的声音变小，绿色消费、乡村振兴、“包容性经济发展”等主题正在取而代之

Foreign brands don’t necessarily represent high quality, The foreign moon is not rounder, and the foreign down jacket is not warmer. The company said that it faced “temporary headwinds” in China, but that its sales in the country had risen in recent weeks and that it planned to invest in the region for the long term.
洋品牌不一定代表高质量，外国的月亮没有更圆，外国的羽绒服也没有更暖。公司说，虽然在中国面临“暂时的逆风”，但公司在中国的销售额最近几周有所上升，公司计划在该地区进行长期投资。

Anta came to prominence after Kong Linghui wore the company’s shoes on his way to winning the gold in table tennis, China’s national obsession, Anta has capitalized on rising nationalist sentiment. As the geopolitical terrain and consumer demands shift, Chinese brands are gaining a distinct edge. What Chinese brands do really, really well is they know how to segment and find a niche customer base
穿着安踏鞋的孔令辉赢得了乒乓球冠军后，该品牌声名鹊起。安踏利用了日益高涨的民族主义情绪。随着地缘政治形势和消费者需求的改变，中国品牌正在获得明显优势. 中国品牌有一点做得非常非常好，他们知道如何细分和寻找利基客户群

Some brands have leaned more explicitly into Chinese culture, Chicecream sold ice cream in the shape of Chinese roof tiles, and Florasis created makeup kits embossed with art that resembles Chinese landscape paintings.
一些品牌已经在更明确地使用中国文化，钟薛高销售中国屋顶瓦片形状的冰淇淋，花西子创造了包装盒上有类似中国山水画的凸起图案的化妆品。

By​ Mr. Kim’s own admission, North Korea’s economy is suffering mightily, hit by years of U.N. sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic.Mr. Kim views his nuclear arsenal as essential to ensuring his regime’s security and ​​keeping an upper hand over South Korea, which he ridicules as a modern vassal state that takes its cues from Washington. 
金正恩本人已承认，由于联合国的多年制裁和新冠病毒大流行的打击，朝鲜经济非常差。金正恩认为他的核武库对确保其政权安全、保持对韩国的优势至关重要。他嘲笑韩国是一个听命于美国的当代附庸国。

Washington’s stereotype about the Communist Party as a monolith used to be flawed, because there was in fact diversity, dissent and pushback within the party, Although he faces governance challenges, Mr. Xi, unlike Mr. Biden, finds himself at the apex of his political power. 
华盛顿对共产党的刻板印象是它是铁板一块，在以前这么说是有问题的，因为它其实是多元的，党内有异议和抵制. 尽管面临治理上的挑战，但习发现自己正处于政治权力的顶点，这与拜登不同。

It was a prescient assessment, though perhaps an understatement: As president, Mr. Biden has treated the Chinese leader more like a Cold War-era nemesis than the calculating bureaucrat he once knew.
这是一个有先见之明的评估，虽然可能说轻了：作为总统，拜登对待这位中国领导人更像是对待冷战时期的对手，而不是他曾经认识的精于算计的官僚。

Their first face-to-face meeting as top leaders will test whether they can halt a downward spiral that has taken relations to the lowest level since President Nixon began the opening to Beijing half a century ago. Their scheduled meeting Monday in Indonesia will take place months after China brandished its military potential to choke off Taiwan, and the United States imposed a series of export controls devised to hobble China’s ability to produce the most advanced computer chips 
他们作为最高领导人的首次面对面会谈将检验他们能否阻止两国关系的螺旋式下降——它已经达到自尼克松总统半个世纪前开始向北京开放以来的最低水平。双方定于周一在印度尼西亚会面，就在几个月前，中国展示了其扼制台湾的军事实力，美国则实施了一系列旨在阻碍中国生产最先进计算机芯片的出口管控措施

Whether it’s a partnership of convenience or a robust alliance, Beijing and Moscow share a growing interest in frustrating the American agenda, many in Washington believe. In turn, many in China see the combination of the U.S. export controls and NATO support for Ukraine as a foreshadowing of how Washington could try to contain China, and stymie its claims to Taiwan
华盛顿的许多人认为，无论是权宜的伙伴关系还是强大的联盟关系，北京和莫斯科在挫败美国议程方面有着越来越大的共同利益。反过来，中国许多人认为，美国的出口管制和北约对乌克兰的支持预示着华盛顿可能会试图遏制中国，并阻挠中国对台湾的主权主张。

 Hundreds of people gathered in shopping malls that autumn to belt out the lyrics. Brass bands and chamber orchestras played it live during gatherings. In 2020, Hong Kong had also passed a law that made disrespect for the Chinese anthem and flag a criminal offense. 
 那年秋天，经常有数以百计的民众聚集在商场里高唱此歌。铜管乐队和室内乐团在集会期间现场演奏此曲。2020年，香港还通过了一项法律，将不尊重国歌的行为定为刑事犯罪。

 They have been seen speaking together in public — at one point, Mr. Xie affectionately clasped Mr. Kerry’s arm — and Mr. Kerry has been spotted walking into the Chinese delegation’s office. On Monday, neither Mr. Kerry nor Mr. Xie would answer questions about what getting a green light from their bosses would mean for the rest of their time at the climate conference.
 有人看到他们在公开场合一起讲话——有一次，解振华热情地抓住克里的手臂——有人看到克里走进了中国代表团的办公室。至于克里和解振华从他们各自的领导人那里得到授权，对于气候大会余下的时间意味着什么，二人在周一都没有回答这一问题。

And Mr. Xi, who is often somber in high-stakes meetings, cracked a smile as a grinning Mr. Biden strode toward him with his hand outstretched. When their meeting began, they greeted each other like old companions. None of that hid the deeply divergent views behind their disagreements, I’m not suggesting this is Kumbaya,
当面带笑容的拜登大步走向习近平时，在重要会面中通常表情严肃的习近平露出了笑容。见面开始时，他们像老朋友一样互致问候。这一切都无法掩盖矛盾背后的深刻分歧，我并不是说皆大欢喜，

Because of their solid personal relationship, there is reassurance in hearing directly from the other leader, there is no reason to think either leader will ease up on their respective priorities or begin to show new deference to the other’s so-called core interests. Both leaders went into the meeting seeking to buy time and take down the temperature, albeit for different reasons. They accomplished that
由于他们稳固的个人关系，直接听取另一位领导人的意见让人感到安心，没有理由认为任何一方会放松各自的优先事项，或者开始顺从对方所谓的核心利益。两位领导人参加会议都是想要争取时间、把温度降下来，尽管是出于不同的原因。他们做到了这一点

Several economic factors, including rising global interest rates, have left several countries unable to pay their debts. In many cases, China is the biggest creditor and has resisted any write-downs.
全球利率上升等经济因素已使一些国家无力偿还债务。在许多情况下，中国是最大的债权人，它一直抵制任何债务减记。

But neither leader went into the meeting expecting the other to concede on their major areas of disagreement. The point, they said, was to keep lines of communication open to prevent the relationship from devolving further.
但是，两位领导人在举行会晤时并不指望对方在主要分歧领域做出让步。他们说，关键是要保持沟通渠道的畅通，防止两国关系进一步恶化。

Until 1804, fewer than one billion people roamed our planet. More than a century later, in 1927, we crossed two billion. Since then, the world population has shot up in the shape of a hockey stick, boosted by the triumphs of modern medicine and public health.
直到1804年的时候，地球上的人口还不到10亿。一个多世纪后的1927年就突破了20亿。那以后，在现代医学和公共卫生进步的推动下，世界人口呈直线上升。

About 70 percent of the growth to eight billion from seven billion happened in low- and lower-middle-income countries, most of which are in sub-Saharan Africa, the United Nations said. The trend is expected to become even more pronounced in the years ahead.
联合国表示，在人口从70亿增长到80亿的过程中，约有70%的增长来自低收入和中低收入国家，大多集中在撒哈拉以南非洲。预计这一趋势将在未来几年变得更加明显。

Meeting the needs — including education, public health, employment, and water and sanitation — created by that growth will require “a significant increase in public expenditures. The growing population has helped fuel consumption at what experts say is an unsustainable pace. It has contributed to environmental challenges, including climate change, deforestation and the loss of biodiversity
要满足人口增长带来的教育、公共卫生、就业、饮水和卫生等需求，需要“大幅增加公共支出”。不断增长的人口加剧了燃料的消耗，专家称这样的速度是不可持续的。联合国表示，这加剧了环境挑战，包括气候变化、森林砍伐和生物多样性的丧失。

The deterioration in ties reached its nadir after 2020, when Beijing vehemently denounced a call by Scott Morrison, then the Australian prime minister, for an international inquiry into the spread of the coronavirus from China. 
2020年之后，两国关系的恶化达到最低点，时任澳大利亚总理斯科特·莫里森呼吁对来自中国的新冠病毒传播进行国际调查，遭到北京的强烈谴责。

Mr. Albanese, whose Labor Party won an election this year, has moved steadily to ease the tensions, without raising hopes that ties with China will return to their former rosy optimism, which was borne out of booming Chinese demand for Australian iron ore and other commodities.
阿尔巴尼斯所在的工党今年赢得了选举，他一直在稳步缓和紧张局势，但也没有让人看到与中国的关系有望恢复到从前的美好——那是一种在中国对澳大利亚铁矿石和其他大宗商品的旺盛需求下形成的良好关系。

Your client is not who you think they are, These are bad people, and they’re up to no good. It strikes me as low-cost, low-risk state-sponsored terrorism in the 21st century. If you’ve got somebody on the other side — an intelligence professional who can lie and create smoke and mirrors — sometimes it’s hard to vet those clients correctly
你的客户不是你想的那样，他们都是坏人，他们不怀好意。在我看来，这是21世纪低成本、低风险的国家支持恐怖主义，如果另一边有这样一个人——一个会撒谎、会制造烟雾和假象的情报专业人员——有时很难正确审查这些客户

For most private eyes, daily work is far from the glamorized depictions in film and literature, with jobs originating with law firms, insurance companies and aggrieved spouses. Today, many assignments come via the internet, with no face-to-face contact. Many private investigators, some with backgrounds in law enforcement, are decidedly old school. That sort of street-level legwork can also provide the basis of an intelligence operation
大多数私人侦探的日常工作与电影和文学作品中被美化的描述相距甚远，在那些描述中，他们的工作来自律师事务所、保险公司和受害的配偶。如今，许多任务都是通过互联网接到，没有面对面的接触。许多私家侦探——其中一些有供职于执法部门的背景——有明显的老派作风。这种街头巷尾的跑腿工作也可以为情报行动提供基础

When I read the complaint against me, I became sick to my stomach. As my background shows, I committed my life to upholding the law and never have — and never would — commit a crime. Brooklyn federal prosecutors have said Mr. McMahon was integral to the scheme.
当我读到针对我的起诉时，我感到很不舒服。正如我的背景所显示的，我毕生致力于维护法律，从来没有，也永远不会犯罪。布鲁克林联邦检察官表示，麦克马洪是该计划不可或缺的一部分。

Whether or not Donald Trump’s hat is in the ring, he’s finished as a serious contender for high office. That’s not a line to write lightly. First, because he has been written off so often in the past. Second, because every time he is written off, his supporters seem to draw energy from their purported irrelevance. And third, because the line will surely be hung around my neck if I’m wrong. He’s yesterday’s man.
无论唐纳德·特朗普是否在竞选擂台上，他作为总统职位的有力竞争者的日子已经结束了。这句话可不是随便说的。首先，他过去一次又一次被认定已经完了.其次，每次说他完了，这种声称的无足轻重似乎都会给他的支持者提供能量。第三，如果我错了，这句话肯定会给我招来骂声。他已经过气了。

In key Senate and gubernatorial races, the former president proffered his endorsements based on fealty over electability. He turned election denialism into a loyalty oath. Primary victories became Pyrrhic ones. 
在关键的参议院和州长竞选中，这位前总统基于忠诚度提供背书，而不是根据候选人的胜任资格。他将否认选举结果变成了忠诚誓言。初选胜利变成了得不偿失的胜利。

Republicans expected a blowout win last week every bit as much as Democrats expected one for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Many of the polls predicted one, as did the normal ebb and flow of American politics. Joe Biden is an unpopular incumbent presiding over an inflationary economy and a border crisis. For the G.O.P. to underperform so badly is a No Excuses moment for the party, and the only coherent explanation for it is the specter of Trump.
共和党人预计上周会大获全胜，与2016年民主党人对希拉里·克林顿的预期如出一辙。许多民意调查都预测了一场胜利，这也符合美国政治正常的潮起潮落。现任总统乔·拜登不受欢迎，在他的领导下，经济通货膨胀，边境充满危机。对于共和党来说，表现如此糟糕是没有借口的，特朗普的影响挥之不去是唯一贯穿始终的解释。

The second is that Trump is finally being abandoned by many of his usually unflagging apologists and enablers in right-wing media, whose influence will be felt downstream.If the voters conclude that you’re putting your own ego or your own grudges ahead of what’s good for the country, they’re going to look elsewhere.
第二个要素是，右翼媒体中许多往常不屈不挠地为特朗普辩护和支持的人抛弃了他，他们的影响会传导到选民那里。如果选民认定你将自己的自负或怨恨置于对国家有利的事情之上，他们就会转向别处。

We owe Trump nothing. Will an unapologetic Trump instead now escalate his slurs, bray at the moon, play out his current angry Ajax role to the bitter end, and thus himself end up a tragic hero — appreciated for past service but deemed too toxic for present company?
我们不欠特朗普任何东西。一个毫无歉意的特朗普现在会不会升级他的诽谤，徒劳无功地大吼大叫，他把自己在扮演的这个愤怒的埃阿斯形象推向了一个可悲的结局，于是他自己最终成为一个悲剧英雄——因过去的服务得到赞誉，但也被认为不利于现在的共和党？

His gratuitous pre-election swipe at Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, whose 19-point victory over the Democrat Charlie Crist was one of the G.O.P.’s few unequivocal highlights of election night. The sin here was not that Trump violated Ronald Reagan’s famous Eleventh Commandment: “Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican.” 
他在选举前无端抨击佛罗里达州州长罗恩·德桑蒂斯，后者以19点的优势击败民主党人查理·克里斯特，这是共和党在选举之夜为数不多的明确亮点之一。这里的罪过并不是特朗普违反了罗纳德·里根著名的“第十一条诫命”：“你不得说任何共和党同胞的坏话。”

And what the Republican base sees in DeSantis is everything it likes about Trump — the combativeness and self-belief and disdain for elite opinion — minus the personal baggage and habits of self-sabotage. In the battle for the affections of American conservatives, the ex-president increasingly feels like the jealous paunchy spouse, the governor like the attractive and successful neighbor.
共和党票仓在德桑蒂斯身上看到的是他们在特朗普身上喜欢的一切——好斗、自信和对精英意见的蔑视——但没有特朗普的个人包袱和自我破坏的习惯。在争夺美国保守派青睐的斗争中，前总统越来越让人感觉像妒火中烧、有肚腩的配偶，而州长则越来越像那个迷人而成功的邻居。

My own sense is that the strategic partnership is strong but that China has room to maneuver a bit within that context, Sometimes signaling closeness, sometimes signaling distance.
我个人的感觉是，两国的战略伙伴关系很牢固，但在这种背景下，中国还有一些回旋余地，有时表示亲近，有时表示距离。

During Mr. Trump’s time in office, his style differed sharply, aligning America with strongmen and dictators at the expense of traditional democratic allies. With Mr. Xi, Mr. Trump vacillated between syrupy compliments and harsh language, depending on the issue.
特朗普在总统任上的做法截然不同，他以牺牲美国的传统民主盟友为代价，公开支持强权人物和独裁者。在对待态度上，特朗普根据问题的不同，在甜言蜜语的恭维和刻薄的言辞之间摇摆不定。

Among the mangroves, Mr. Biden was asked if he had any reaction to Mr. Trump’s run. The president shared a look with Mr. Macron and continued walking. “No. Not really,” he said, turning his attention back to the plants.
记者在红树林中问拜登对特朗普参选有何反应。拜登与马克龙交换了一个眼神后继续往前走。“没有。真没什么，”他说，然后将注意力转回到树上。

When I left office, the United States stood ready for its golden age, Our nation was at the pinnacle of its power, prosperity and prestige, towering above all rivals, vanquishing all enemies, and striding into the future confident and strong. For the first time in memory,China was reeling and back on its heels.
在我卸任时，美国已做好了迎接黄金时代的准备，我们的国家处于国力、繁荣和威望的顶峰，超越一切对手，战胜一切敌人，自信而强大地迈向未来。这是记忆中第一次，中国开始陷入困境，立足不稳。

No matter that it would be less prestigious for Kevin Li than his job in Taiwan at one of the world’s leading chip makers. Some who went to work in China were villains who exchanged secrets for money, Some wanted to be free from the work pressures in Taiwan. And there were those who seriously wanted to explore new areas.
但对凯文·李来说，开出的条件再好，还是不如他在台湾一家全球领先的芯片制造商上班体面. 过去（中国工作）的人，就是一些带机密换财富的普通人,有想脱离在台湾工作压力的人，有认真想去拓荒的人。

Sweeping bans imposed by the Biden administration last month targeting China’s chip industry have put the island’s premier chip maker on the front line of likely disruptions to the global supply chain. Adding to the pressure, the Biden administration has pressed TSMC into building a plant in Arizona to help diversify the United States’ sources of chips. So far, TSMC said, the impact of the new rules has been limited. The administration granted a one-year waiver to the company
拜登政府上个月对中国芯片行业实施全面禁令，将台湾主要的芯片制造商台积电推到了可能出现的全球供应链扰动的前沿。此外，拜登政府还向台积电施压，要求它在亚利桑那州设厂，帮助美国实现芯片来源的多元化。台积电表示，到目前为止，新规定的影响有限。政府给予该公司为期一年的豁免

The companies were suspected of being fronts created to recruit local engineers for jobs; more than 40 cases of poaching workers and stealing secrets have been prosecuted since last year
这些企业被怀疑是为招聘当地工程师工作而设的幌子；自去年以来，已经起诉了40多起挖角和窃密案件。

When Mr. Li arrived at TSMC, he felt lucky but found it a slog inside the foundry, I had the feeling of being a small screw most when working in TSMC, Going to China was like looking forward to a place without the constraints of an outdated framework. You can take the plunge by going there.
当凯文·李来到台积电，感觉自己很幸运，但发现在代工厂里干活的日子很艰苦。我在台积时有‘小螺丝钉’的感受，到中国是期待一个没有陈旧框架的束缚，可以放手去干。

People-to-people exchange may seem banal, but it has already proved vitally important to China-U.S. relations. In 1971, with the United States and China deeply estranged, the thaw began with “Ping-Pong diplomacy,” which paved the way for diplomatic normalization and eventually the return of an isolated China to the community of nations.
人与人之间的交流看似平淡无奇，但事实证明，这对中美关系来说至关重要。1971年，美中关系严重疏远，解冻始于“乒乓外交”，它为外交正常化铺平了道路，并最终使孤立的中国重返国际社会。

Days before, officials discussed ways to make the night safe and manage disorderly crowds, largely sharing concerns of people spilling into car lanes and men wielding “fake weapons” and “bikini girls” who might expose “too much,” according to official documents from the police, the fire department and the Yongsan ward office, which oversees Itaewon.
警察厅、消防厅和负责梨泰院的龙山区办公室的官方文件显示，几天前，官员们讨论了如何保证夜间安全，并管理混乱人群，主要是担忧涌入车道的人群、手持“假武器”的男子和可能暴露“太多”的“比基尼女孩”。

For years, Western video games served as cultural touchstones for many young people in China, leaving a generation with fond memories of late nights packed in smoke-filled internet cafes. That shift already began to crystallize on the Chinese internet. 
多年来，西方电子游戏一直是许多中国年轻人的文化试金石，为一代人留下了深夜泡在烟雾缭绕的网吧里的美好回忆。这种转变已开始在中国的互联网上呈现出来。
