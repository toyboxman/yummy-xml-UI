The economic pain has intensified the pressure to ease pandemic restrictions to salvage the flagging economy and restore some semblance of normal life.The growing unrest has threatened to jeopardize China’s hard-earned reputation as the world’s factory floor. For small businesses, the recent outbreak is already sapping demand.
经济痛苦加大了放松疫情限制以挽救萎靡不振的经济，并在一定程度上恢复正常生活的压力。不断加剧的动荡可能危及中国来之不易的“世界工厂”声誉。对于小企业来说，最近的疫情已经在削弱需求。

Yet even as he rolls out the police, he is projecting an unruffled appearance of business as usual. He has stayed silent about the rare open challenge to his rule that erupted in the protests, including calls for him to step down. He appears to be wagering that by outwardly ignoring the demonstrations, he can sap their momentum 
然而，即便在出动警力之时，他仍表现出一如既往的镇定自若。对于抗议活动中爆发的公开挑战其统治地位的罕见行为，包括要求下台的呼声，他始终保持沉默。他似乎是在打赌，靠表面上对示威活动的无视，他能够削弱其势头。

They’re saying as little as possible for as long as possible,If they speak, it could inflame the situation, so it’s better to sit back and pretend nothing is happening. Like a newborn calf that isn’t afraid of a tiger.
他们会在尽可能长的时间里尽可能地少说话，如果他们发言，情况可能变得更糟，所以最好是不采取行动，假装什么都没有发生。初生牛犊不怕虎的那种感觉吧。

In the eyes of many foreign politicians, Mr. Jiang was the garrulous, disarming exception to the mold of stiff, unsmiling Chinese leaders. He was the Communist who would quote Lincoln, proclaim his love for Hollywood films and burst into songs like “Love Me Tender.” Less enthralled Chinese called him a “flowerpot,” likening him to a frivolous ornament, and mocking his quirky vanities. His critics in China and abroad viewed these steps as little more than tacking with the political winds.
在许多外国政治人物的眼中，他风趣健谈，容易使人放下戒心，那种风格在历届不苟言笑、僵硬划一的中国领导人中是个例外。他是那种会引用林肯名言，承认喜爱好莱坞电影，会即兴唱起猫王的《温柔地爱我》的共产党人.对他好感和兴趣较少的中国人叫他“花瓶”，把他比作一件华而不实的装饰品，嘲笑他的烦文虚饰。中国和外界的批评者说，这些做法不过是政治上的见风使舵。

That new scholarship has found to be exceedingly durable against even explosive unrest. The government is also especially skilled at maintaining unity among the country’s elite, which is often the deciding factor in whether protesters can force systemic change.That does not mean the protests are doomed. Having erupted spontaneously in a short period,they will fade away without reaching any climax or denouement.In retrospect, it was a high-water mark.
新的学术研究发现，即便面临严重动乱，此类政权仍能持久稳固。政府还特别擅长团结国内精英阶层，而这一阶层往往是抗议能否推动系统性变革的决定因素。但这并不意味着抗议注定失败。这些抗议在短时间内自发点燃，也会在没有高潮或结局的情况下逐渐熄灭。现在看来，那已经是顶点了。

Those governments’ resilience, the scholars argue, comes from the revolution that swept them into power. Revolutionary movements typically uproot every aspect of the old order, from business leaders to officer corps to administrative bureaucracies.Such systems are also remarkably cohesive. And disagreements or power struggles are among revolutionaries who are bought into the system and work to uphold it as is.
两位学者认为，这些政府的适应力来自让它们获得权力的革命。革命运动通常会把旧秩序的方方面面斩草除根，从商业领袖到官员集团到行政官僚机构。这样的体制有着颇强的凝聚力。因为分歧或斗争是在通过革命上台的革命者之间进行的，他们会合力保持现状。

As the revolution fills these out with its own, it is left with few internal rivals or threats — closing off exactly the sorts of high-level fissures that a protest movement must open in order to force a change in leadership.A deeply institutionalized party bureaucracy. Internally enforced hierarchies of power. Pervasive political control of security and military forces. Deep party roots in everything from business boardrooms to local village affairs.
革命者在这些位置上安排自己的人，于是就很少会有内部敌对或威胁——缺少了抗议运动所需要的那种在权力高层的裂隙，而要迫使领导层做出改变，必须有这样的裂隙。这是一个高度机构化的政党官僚机构。在内部实施的权力等级制度。对安全和军事力量进行无处不在的政治控制。从企业董事会到地方村镇，一切都有着深刻的政党根源。

When the demonstrators took to the streets, it evoked the moment Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon. The die has been cast. It is ironic how this came about. 
当示威者走上街头，就像尤利乌斯·恺撒横渡卢比孔河的时刻。一切已成定局。事情之所以走到这一步，其实相当讽刺。
