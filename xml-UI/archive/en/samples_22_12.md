The economic pain has intensified the pressure to ease pandemic restrictions to salvage the flagging economy and restore some semblance of normal life.The growing unrest has threatened to jeopardize China’s hard-earned reputation as the world’s factory floor. For small businesses, the recent outbreak is already sapping demand.
经济痛苦加大了放松疫情限制以挽救萎靡不振的经济，并在一定程度上恢复正常生活的压力。不断加剧的动荡可能危及中国来之不易的“世界工厂”声誉。对于小企业来说，最近的疫情已经在削弱需求。

Yet even as he rolls out the police, he is projecting an unruffled appearance of business as usual. He has stayed silent about the rare open challenge to his rule that erupted in the protests, including calls for him to step down. He appears to be wagering that by outwardly ignoring the demonstrations, he can sap their momentum 
然而，即便在出动警力之时，他仍表现出一如既往的镇定自若。对于抗议活动中爆发的公开挑战其统治地位的罕见行为，包括要求下台的呼声，他始终保持沉默。他似乎是在打赌，靠表面上对示威活动的无视，他能够削弱其势头。

They’re saying as little as possible for as long as possible,If they speak, it could inflame the situation, so it’s better to sit back and pretend nothing is happening. Like a newborn calf that isn’t afraid of a tiger.
他们会在尽可能长的时间里尽可能地少说话，如果他们发言，情况可能变得更糟，所以最好是不采取行动，假装什么都没有发生。初生牛犊不怕虎的那种感觉吧。

In the eyes of many foreign politicians, Mr. Jiang was the garrulous, disarming exception to the mold of stiff, unsmiling Chinese leaders. He was the Communist who would quote Lincoln, proclaim his love for Hollywood films and burst into songs like “Love Me Tender.” Less enthralled Chinese called him a “flowerpot,” likening him to a frivolous ornament, and mocking his quirky vanities. His critics in China and abroad viewed these steps as little more than tacking with the political winds.
在许多外国政治人物的眼中，他风趣健谈，容易使人放下戒心，那种风格在历届不苟言笑、僵硬划一的中国领导人中是个例外。他是那种会引用林肯名言，承认喜爱好莱坞电影，会即兴唱起猫王的《温柔地爱我》的共产党人.对他好感和兴趣较少的中国人叫他“花瓶”，把他比作一件华而不实的装饰品，嘲笑他的烦文虚饰。中国和外界的批评者说，这些做法不过是政治上的见风使舵。

That new scholarship has found to be exceedingly durable against even explosive unrest. The government is also especially skilled at maintaining unity among the country’s elite, which is often the deciding factor in whether protesters can force systemic change.That does not mean the protests are doomed. Having erupted spontaneously in a short period,they will fade away without reaching any climax or denouement.In retrospect, it was a high-water mark.
新的学术研究发现，即便面临严重动乱，此类政权仍能持久稳固。政府还特别擅长团结国内精英阶层，而这一阶层往往是抗议能否推动系统性变革的决定因素。但这并不意味着抗议注定失败。这些抗议在短时间内自发点燃，也会在没有高潮或结局的情况下逐渐熄灭。现在看来，那已经是顶点了。

Those governments’ resilience, the scholars argue, comes from the revolution that swept them into power. Revolutionary movements typically uproot every aspect of the old order, from business leaders to officer corps to administrative bureaucracies.Such systems are also remarkably cohesive. And disagreements or power struggles are among revolutionaries who are bought into the system and work to uphold it as is.
两位学者认为，这些政府的适应力来自让它们获得权力的革命。革命运动通常会把旧秩序的方方面面斩草除根，从商业领袖到官员集团到行政官僚机构。这样的体制有着颇强的凝聚力。因为分歧或斗争是在通过革命上台的革命者之间进行的，他们会合力保持现状。

As the revolution fills these out with its own, it is left with few internal rivals or threats — closing off exactly the sorts of high-level fissures that a protest movement must open in order to force a change in leadership.A deeply institutionalized party bureaucracy. Internally enforced hierarchies of power. Pervasive political control of security and military forces. Deep party roots in everything from business boardrooms to local village affairs.
革命者在这些位置上安排自己的人，于是就很少会有内部敌对或威胁——缺少了抗议运动所需要的那种在权力高层的裂隙，而要迫使领导层做出改变，必须有这样的裂隙。这是一个高度机构化的政党官僚机构。在内部实施的权力等级制度。对安全和军事力量进行无处不在的政治控制。从企业董事会到地方村镇，一切都有着深刻的政党根源。

When the demonstrators took to the streets, it evoked the moment Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon. The die has been cast. It is ironic how this came about. 
当示威者走上街头，就像尤利乌斯·恺撒横渡卢比孔河的时刻。一切已成定局。事情之所以走到这一步，其实相当讽刺。

A woman at a clinic in Tianjin said “there was no discomfort” with a new inhaled vaccine, while a woman in Shanghai quipped that getting her booster was “a bit like drinking milk tea.” A man in Wenzhou reassured the hesitant, “it doesn’t hurt at all, and it’s a little sweet.” even as new inhalable vaccines are being portrayed as less scary than those that require a needle.
天津一名女子在接种点接种了新的吸入式疫苗后称“没有任何不适”，上海一名女子接种了加强剂后打趣地说“有点像喝奶茶”。温州一名男子说“一点都不疼，还有点甜”，以打消犹豫不决者的疑虑。尽管新的吸入式疫苗被描述为不像需要打针的疫苗那么吓人。

Ideally, you would be prepared before you open the gates, This is really not a recipe for a smooth transition — it’s going to be a bumpy ride. Officials have to overcome a deeply ingrained skepticism that they helped instill.
理想情况下，你会在打开大门之前做好准备，目前的做法真不是平稳过渡的秘诀——前面的道路将充满颠簸。官员们不得不克服他们帮助老年人形成的对疫苗根深蒂固的怀疑态度。

Scientists hope that by inducing an immune response in the nasal cavities and the lungs, an inhaled vaccine could offer significant protection, particularly against transmission. In reality, little is known about the real-world effectiveness of the new inhaled vaccines, which are being studied around the world but have not been broadly put to the test.
科学家们希望吸入式疫苗能通过在鼻腔和肺诱发免疫响应，提供相当程度的保护，尤其是针对感染的保护。实际上，人们对新型吸入式疫苗在现实世界中的效力知之甚少，虽然世界各地都在研究这种疫苗，但还没有对其进行广泛的临床试验。

Neither country, of course, can claim any real triumph. Both have suffered trauma, severe economic damage and political turmoil in their efforts to contain Covid. All the more reason, then, to distract people with nationalistic slurs against a rival. We all crave freedom and safety. Maybe it’s the fate of governments to botch the balance.
当然，两国都不能宣称自己取得了真正的胜利。在防控新冠疫情的努力中，两国都深受创伤，经历了严重的经济破坏和政治动荡。因此，它们也更有理由利用民族主义抹黑对方，分散民众的注意力。我们都渴望自由和安全。而搞砸这二者之间的平衡，似乎正是两国政府在所难免的命运。

It makes me recall when I was dispatched to a Shanghai high school years ago to report on the world’s highest-scoring standardized test takers. I was taken aback by the unexpected humility of the Chinese educational experts I interviewed. They fretted that students weren’t learning to think creatively — that Chinese youth, while technically flawless, might still struggle to compete in fields that required innovation.
这让我想起多年前我被派往上海一所高中报道拿下标准化考试全球最高分考生的经历。受采访的中国教育专家所表现出的谦逊令我吃惊。他们担心学生没有学会创造性思考，中国年轻人的学习方法或许无懈可击，但在需要创新精神的领域可能仍然缺乏竞争力。

In game theory terms, the hostage is an asset with only one potential buyer: their home government. If that government refuses to deal, the seller is left with nothing but self-inflicted costs that will only rise. Such risks are inherent in hostage diplomacy. For the hostage-taker, the potential upside is typically small and fixed, like the release of a citizen arrested abroad, while the downsides are unpredictable and potentially large. It’s like putting up your house as collateral on a $100 bet.
在博弈论中，人质是一种资产，潜在买家只有一个：即人质的本国政府。如果其政府拒绝交易，卖方只会给自己徒增成本。人质外交必然包含这样的风险。对于劫持方来说，潜在好处通常很少且固定，比如在国外被捕的公民获释。但坏处是无法预测，代价也可能很大。这就好比在100美元的赌注中押上了自己的房子。

Its once bleak prognostications have turned downright optimistic: Covid-19 is entering the “last stage” and will soon become a manageable seasonal illness, said one of China’s leading voices on the coronavirus. 
政府对疫情曾经悲观的预言已转变成极为乐观，国内新冠病毒方面的一位主要专家说，疫情正在进入“最后一程”，很快会变成一种可控制的季节性疾病。

With efficient space management, the Chinese space station will offer four-fifths as many racks for experiments as the International Space Station does, One of the experiments will be an extremely cold atomic clock. This can play a very good role in some basic physics research, such as non-Newtonian gravitation and gravitational redshift” research
通过高效的空间管理，中国空间站提供的实验机柜数量将会是国际空间站的五分之四。其中一项实验内容将是极冷原子钟。这个可以对一些基础物理方面的研究起到很好的作用，比如说非牛顿引力、引力红移等

As soon as next year, the space station will also have a separately launched telescope, Xuntian, orbiting nearby to survey the universe at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths — in many ways, a more sophisticated version of NASA’s 32-year-old Hubble Space Telescope.
最快到明年，该空间站还将单独发射巡天号空间望远镜，在附近轨道上以光学和紫外线波长观测宇宙——在许多方面上，这种观测要比美国宇航局运行了32年之久的哈勃空间望远镜更加精密。

The characteristic of the sky survey telescope is that it can do large-scale sky surveys — we plan to complete surveying 42 percent of the sky’s area in 10 years, We expect that it can obtain some very important results, especially that our telescope should be unique in the world in the ultraviolet wavelengths.
巡天望远镜的特点就是可以做大范围的巡天测量，我们计划是用10年的时间完成大概42%的天区的巡天，我们可以期待它可以获得一些很重要的成果，特别是我们这个望远镜在紫外波段，应该是全球独一无二的。

Indian and Chinese troops wielding fists, clubs and stun guns have again clashed in a disputed border territory, injuring several soldiers on each side and showing that tensions have not been extinguished after a deadly confrontation more than two years ago. China said it had been conducting a routine patrol on its side of the line, while India said Chinese troops had encroached on Indian territory.
印度和中国军队在有争议的边境地区再次发生冲突，双方挥舞着拳头、棍棒和电击枪，均有数名士兵受伤，这表明在两年多前的一场致命对抗后，紧张局势并未平息。中国表示，它一直在控制线的一侧进行例行巡逻，而印度则表示，中国军队侵犯了印度领土。

One of the selected experiments, POLAR-2, is an international effort led by the University of Geneva to study distant gamma-ray bursts. Gamma-ray bursts are some of the most violent explosions in the universe, caused by exploding stars or merging neutron stars. The explosions send short, intense jets of ultra-high-energy photons known as gamma rays traveling across the universe.
“天极-2”伽马暴偏振探测仪是被选定的实验项目之一，这是由日内瓦大学主导的一项国际项目，旨在研究远程伽玛射线暴。伽玛射线暴是宇宙中最剧烈的爆发现象之一，由恒星爆炸或中子星并合引起。这种爆炸会引发短暂而强烈的超高能光子射流——即伽马射线——穿越宇宙。

The experiment examines whether gamma rays from a gamma-ray burst line up in a particular way. More than a decade ago, measurements by an instrument on a Japanese spacecraft suggested that gamma rays were often linearly polarized — that is, the oscillating electric fields of the gamma rays were parallel to each other like a squadron of airplanes flying level instead of with their wings skewed in every direction.
该实验将检测伽马射线暴中的伽马射线是否以特定的方式排列。十多年前，日本一架航天器上的仪器测量表明，伽马射线通常是线性偏振的——也就是说，伽马射线的振荡电场彼此平行，就像一队水平飞行的飞机，其机翼并不是各个方向倾斜。

Sidewalks and pedestrian shopping streets are barren, and once busy traffic thoroughfares are deserted. Residents are hunkering down indoors and hoarding medicine as a wave of Covid sweeps across the Chinese capital. Beijing looks like a city in the throes of a lockdown — this time, self-imposed by residents. 
人行道和步行购物街人迹稀少，曾经繁忙的交通要道现在变得空空荡荡。随着一轮新冠疫情席卷中国首都，民众都躲在家中并囤积药物。北京看起来像是一座处于封控困境下的城市，只不过这次是民众自己强加的。

The hoarding of remedies isn’t limited to cough medicine and lozenges. Stores are now running out of jarred peaches because they’re believed to be packed with enough nutrients to ward off the virus.
囤积的药品不仅限于止咳药和润喉糖。商店里的黄桃罐头现已售罄，因为据信它们富含足以抵御病毒的营养。

The world has not been extremely kind to Africa, It’s almost as if the carving out and colonization of Africa assumed a new form without the labels of colonization — but some measure of conquest. And we’re trying to move away from that and engage so that they work with us and not on us and through us.
世界对非洲并不是特别友善，对非洲的开拓和殖民似乎有了一种新的形式，没有殖民的特征，但仍是某种程度的征服。我们正在努力摆脱这种情况，并参与其中，以便让他们与我们合作，而不是对我们进行图谋利用。

It was a clash between two former coup leaders, set against the backdrop of a remote and palm-fringed vacation destination that has, of late, taken on outsized importance in a battle for primacy in the Pacific between the United States and China. 
这是两位前政变领导人之间的交锋，地点位于一个棕榈树环绕的偏远度假胜地。最近在美国和中国争夺太平洋主导权的斗争中，这个度假胜地变得格外重要。

This demonstrates that our adherence to the rule of law, the seriousness with which we take these incidents, has had an effect and we will continue on the world stage and domestically to abide by the rule of law and expect others to do likewise.
这表明我们对法治的坚持，我们对这些事件的严肃态度，已经产生了影响，我们将继续在世界舞台和国内遵守法治，并期望其他国家也这样做。

He expected pent-up demand in the economy to be “relatively weak” next year after three years of lockdowns depleted the finances of many Chinese households. Part of the uncertainty hanging over how China will emerge from “zero Covid” is that no country of this size has pivoted this quickly, this drastically — shifting seemingly overnight from full-on assault against Covid to learning to live with the virus. Long-established rules are changing by the day.
预计被压抑的需求对明年经济的刺激作用会“相对较弱”，因为近三年的封控已耗尽了中国许多家庭的积蓄。在一定程度上，笼罩在中国如何走出“新冠清零”头上的不确定性在于，没有一个如此大的国家如此迅速、彻底地改变做法，中国从竭尽全力遏制新冠病毒到学会与病毒共存的转变，似乎发生在一夜之间。执行了很久的规定每天都在变。

Just months after the Soviet collapse, the 87-year-old leader rallied the party and breathed new life into market reforms. The decades of economic success that followed reaffirmed the party’s “mandate of heaven” — the imperial-era concept of a divine right to rule.
苏联刚解体几个月，这位87岁的领导人就重振了党的精神，为市场改革注入新活力。随后几十年的经济成功再次确认了党的“天命”，这是帝王时代的一种君权神授的概念。

As if China’s aggressive turn was not clear, candid translations of proceedings at the Communist Party’s 20th National Congress in October show that they de-emphasized phrases like “peace and development” and adopted phrases like “preparing for the storm” and “the spirit of struggle.” The objective of this strategic decoupling is simple — reciprocity. It is precisely what China does to us. 
如果中国这样的侵略性转向还不算明显，那么10月召开的中共二十大会议内容直接挑明，中国不再强调“和平与发展”，而是选择了“准备经受惊涛骇浪”和“斗争精神”等说法。这种战略脱钩的目标很简单——对等。这正是中国对付我们的方式。

When demand for fever-reducing drugs more than quadrupled the price of ibuprofen, a city in eastern China began rationing sales by selling the pills individually. The whiplash of change has caught the nation’s hospitals, clinics and pharmacies off guard. Across many cities, pharmacies have sold out of the most common fever and cold medicines. Lines of people have formed at hospitals, and medication has flown off drugstore shelves.
对退烧药的需求导致布洛芬的价格增长了三倍多后，中国东部一座城市开始用按片出售的方式限量供应。政策突变使全国的医院、诊所和药店措手不及。最常见的退烧药和感冒药已在许多城市的药店售罄。医院里排起了长队，药店货架上的药物已卖光。

Many Chinese are now confronting the specter of a massive Covid outbreak that could stretch through the winter, and have been forced to improvise to fill in the gaps. Some are turning to folk remedies like canned peaches, believing they can ward off illness.
许多中国人现在面临着贯穿整个冬季的大规模新冠疫情的恐慌，人们被迫想办法自救。有些人转向民间偏方，比如黄桃罐头，认为它可抵御病痛。

Be resolute in fighting and winning this war of annihilation against the pandemic, Not a day of delay. China’s party-run media has cast the shift as a stressful but well-considered exit, opening the way back to good economic times. 
坚决打好打赢疫情歼灭战，一天不耽误。中国党媒将这一转变描述为一场承受巨大压力但经过不断平衡抉择后的退出，为重返经济繁荣时期开辟了道路。

Relations between the two countries had “stood the test of international changes” and that their partnership was a “long-term strategic choice made by both sides,” The exercises, involving a Russian-guided missile cruiser and Chinese destroyers, will include joint air defense and anti-submarine activities to improve coordination and cooperation between the two navies, 
两国关系“经受住国际风云变幻的考验”，而双方合作则是“基于各自国情作出的长远战略选择”。俄罗斯一艘导弹巡洋舰和中国驱逐舰群将参与演习，演习项目包括联合防空和反潜活动，以提升两国海军协调合作的能力。

If brevity is the soul of wit, as some wag once said, maybe no words is the wittiest option of all. A sheet of paper may be the ultimate “analog” artifact, but it has emerged as an unusually potent digital-age totem — a meme that is rebounding in fascinating ways between the street and the virtual world. For all the tumult at the barricades, the white signs may reveal more about algorithms, data flow and the way images and ideas resonate online.
有人曾说，简洁是智慧的灵魂，那或许，无言才是最明智的选择。一张纸或许是最好的“类比”物，但它已成为一种异常强大的数字时代图腾——即以极为有趣的形式折返于街头和虚拟世界的米姆。尽管路障附近有种种混乱，但这些白色标志可能更多地揭示了关于算法、数据流以及影像和思想在网上引发共鸣的方式。

In 1965, an episode of “Candid Camera” featured a prank in which protesters with blank placards picketed in front of a vacant lot in New York. Four years later, students at a high school in Toronto held a mock sit-in featuring blank signs and a blank list of “demands.” An Associated Press report about the protest bore the cheeky headline “ , Students Demand.”
1965年，《偷拍》(Candid Camera)有一集内容讲的就是抗议者的恶作剧，他们拿着空白的标语牌在纽约一处空地前聚集。四年后，多伦多一所高中的学生举行了一次模拟静坐示威，亮出了空白标语和空白的“诉求”清单。美联社给这场抗议的报道安了一个恶搞标题——《学生诉求》。

In retrospect, those 1960s stunts seem ideologically conservative: They were parodies, staged at the height of the civil rights era and the Vietnam War, that mocked the very idea of protest. 
回头再看，上世纪60年代的那些噱头在意识形态上似乎是保守的：那是在民权时代和越战期间矛盾最激烈之时上演的拙劣模仿，嘲讽的正是抗议的概念本身。

These signs tell an absurdist joke, ridiculing both censorship and those who enforce it. They function as bait: When security forces — often uniformed and well armed — detain a citizen holding a blank sign, the paranoia and irrationality of state power is thrown into relief. Like a shrewd act of internet trolling, the blank sign is a button-pusher that lures its target into a revealing self-own.
这些标志都代表了荒诞的玩笑，嘲笑了审查制度及其执行者。它们就像一种诱饵：当通常穿着制服、装备精良的安全部队抓捕一位举着空白标志的公民，国家权力的妄想症和非理性就会暴露无遗。这就像网络水军的精明计谋一样，空白标志是诱使目标自我暴露的开关。

A keen observer of city life, Xi Xi (pronounced SIGH-sigh in Cantonese) focused on the quiet strength of underdogs and the overlooked significance of Hong Kong itself. Her incisive and poetic writing cemented the city’s place in Chinese-language literature and beyond. Using language that was deceptively simple, almost childlike, Xi Xi infused her fiction and poetry with eclectic references to literature, cinema, art, architecture and fairy tales.
作为城市生活的敏锐观察者，西西专注于弱势群体的安静力量和香港本身遭到忽视的意义，而她精辟而富有诗意的写作巩固了这座城市在华语文学和世界文学中的地位。西西的语言看似简单、近乎孩童，她的小说和诗歌中融合了文学、电影、艺术、建筑和童话故事。

The pumpkin turns into a carriage; mice turn into horses; Cinderella’s rags turn into a ball gown. But at midnight everything turns back into what it was, Was the floating city just another Cinderella?
南瓜变成马车，老鼠变成骏马，破烂的灰衣裳变成华丽的舞衣。不过，到了子夜十二时正，一切都会变成原来的样子，浮城也是一则‘灰姑娘’的童话吗？

In nominating her for the prize, the Hong Kong poet Tammy Lai-Ming Ho described Xi Xi’s poetry as “feminine, tender, witty, observant, and capable of tugging at the heartstrings,” adding that it “speaks to the character of the city and its people.” A former public-school teacher, she wrote poems about animals and children that were often steeped in commentary about wealth disparity and David-and-Goliath power dynamics. 
香港诗人何丽明在提名西西为该奖候选人时，形容西西的诗歌“阴柔、纤细、机智、敏锐，动人心弦”，并说，她的诗“道出了这座城市及其居民的品格”。作为一名前公立学校教师，她写了一些关于动物和儿童的诗，这些诗经常充斥着对贫富差距，以及大卫与巨人式的权力平衡问题的讨论。

She described forays into wealthy neighborhoods, where she combed supermarket shelves for groceries free of carcinogenic additives. The cancer treatment damaged a nerve in her right hand, forcing her to learn to write with her left. She began making puppets and mohair teddy bears as a form of physical therapy, dressing them as figures from Chinese mythology, literature and history.
她描述了自己跑去有钱人住的街区，在超市货架上寻找不含致癌添加剂的食品的经历。癌症治疗损伤了她右手的神经，迫使她学会用左手写字。作为一种物理疗法，她开始制作木偶和马海毛泰迪熊，把它们打扮成中国神话、文学和历史中的人物。

Passing a restaurant in my Shanghai neighborhood once, I saw customers inside curling up against the window, trying to get comfortable so that they could sleep. I started taking my phone charger and toiletry bag everywhere.
有一次，我路过我家附近的一家餐馆时，看到里面的顾客蜷缩在窗户旁，试图让自己能舒服一点入睡。那之后，我开始在出门时随身携带手机充电器和洗漱用具。

I’ve shuttled back and forth since then, splitting my time between them and my work as a journalist in China. The all-too-brief family visits were weighted with the anxiety of staying Covid-free so that I would be allowed back into China. 
那之后，我一直往返于两国之间，有时在荷兰陪孩子，大部分时间在中国当记者。每次在荷兰度过那些过于短暂的假期都有一个沉重的负担，总有不要感染新冠病毒的焦虑，这样我才能被允许返回中国。

Authorities have relaxed testing requirements but, out of habit, I still sometimes stop by my local testing booth, one of the few that wasn’t hastily dismantled. The swab grazing my throat feels comforting and safe.
当局放松了核酸检测要求后，出于习惯，我有时还会去我家附近的核酸采样点，尚未被仓促拆除的采样点已经为数不多。棉签捅进我的喉咙给我一种舒服和安全的感觉。

China has nonetheless managed to retain full employment — but mainly by promoting an enormous housing bubble. China’s real estate sector is incredibly bloated. This isn’t a sustainable state of affairs. Economists often cite Stein’s Law: “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” Exactly how China’s bubble will end isn’t clear — it might be a sharp slowdown, or it might be a period of “low quality” growth that masks the true extent of the problem, but it won’t be pretty.
尽管如此，中国还是成功地保持了充分就业——但主要是通过推动巨大的房地产泡沫。这种状况是不可持续的。经济学家经常引用斯坦定律：“如果一件事不能永远持续下去，它就会停止。”中国的泡沫究竟将如何结束还不清楚——可能是急剧放缓，也可能是一段“低质量”增长时期，同时掩盖问题的真实程度，但这不会是好事。

Nobody is very good at predicting long-term growth; as the M.I.T. economist Robert Solow famously quipped, attempts to explain differences in national growth rates often end in a “blaze of amateur sociology.”
没有人擅长预测长期增长；正如麻省理工学院经济学家罗伯特·索洛的一句名言，试图解释国家增长率差异的尝试往往以“业余社会学的狂热”告终。

When measuring the size of national economies, you need to distinguish between the dollar value of G.D.P. and output measured at “purchasing power parity,” which is normally higher in lower-income economies, where the cost of living tends to be relatively low.
在衡量国家经济规模时，你需要区分GDP的美元价值和以“购买力平价”衡量的产出，后者在低收入经济体中通常更高，因为那里的生活成本往往相对较低。
