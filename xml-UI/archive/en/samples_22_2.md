Wearing a periwinkle neck gaiter with a flower print and the black-and-red Team China uniform, she doubled over to catch her breath after crossing the finish line.

The city, Qitaihe, has endured mine disasters, industrial closures and an exodus of young people. Yet it has also emerged as a powerhouse in short-track speedskating.

Fly, flip, twist, land; fly, flip, twist, land. Again and again, forging confidence and burning the corkscrewed aerial movements into muscle memory. Then it was straight to the T-bar that dragged her back to the top. The quiet monotony repeated, for weeks through the fall.
腾空，翻转，转体，落地；腾空，翻转，转体，落地。一遍又一遍的训练打造出她的信心，将空中翻腾动作锻造为她的肌肉记忆。然后，她直奔T字缆车，又回到滑道顶端。整个秋季，这种寂静的单调训练持续了好几周时间
