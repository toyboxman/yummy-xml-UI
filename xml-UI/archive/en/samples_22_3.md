We should all have that clarity today. Unfortunately, a kind of self-serving denialism pervades Western capitals and prevents us from seeing the obvious. Passionate pleas to defend post-Cold War European order have no meaning because this era is over. Today, we are all living in it. In this world, to quote Thucydides, “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.”
我们今天都应该有这样的清醒认识。不幸的是，西方政府普遍存在一种自私的否认主义，令我们无法看到显而易见的事实。捍卫冷战后欧洲秩序的热情呼吁毫无意义，因为这个时代已经过去了. 今天，我们都生活在其中。在这个世界里，用修昔底德的话来说，“强者肆意而为，弱者自需受苦。”

The West can only win over skeptics of its efforts to combat Mr. Putin if it succeeds in showing those outside of Europe that what is at stake in Kyiv is not the fate of a pro-Western regime but the sovereignty of a newly born post-imperial state. War in Ukraine has the frightening potential to heat up frozen conflicts on the continent’s periphery, including elsewhere in the post-Soviet space and the Western Balkans. 
西方只有成功地向欧洲以外的人表明，在基辅，危在旦夕的不是一个亲西方政权的命运，而是一个新生的后帝国主义国家的主权，才能说服那些质疑打击普京努力的怀疑论者。乌克兰的战争有可能使欧洲大陆边缘冷却的冲突升温，包括后苏联地区和西巴尔干地区的其他地方

Mr. Enzensberger was right. He was just too early. Reflecting on what he observed in Yugoslavia and the urban riots in the United States, he saw a world defined by an “inability to distinguish between destruction and self-destruction.” In this world, “there is no longer any need to legitimize your actions. Violence has freed itself from ideology.”
恩岑斯贝格尔是对的。他只是太超前了。回顾他在南斯拉夫的观察和美国的城市骚乱，他看到了一个“无法区分毁灭和自我毁灭”的世界。在这个世界上，“不再需要让你的行为合法化。暴力本身已摆脱了意识形态。”

On Monday, the Russian central bank had to keep the Russian stock market closed to prevent a panicked meltdown and was forced to raise its benchmark interest rate in one day to 20 percent from 9.5 percent to encourage people to hold rubles. Even then the ruble nose-dived by about 30 percent against the dollar — it’s now worth less than 1 U.S. cent.
周一，俄罗斯央行不得不关闭国内股市以防止恐慌崩盘，并被迫在一天之内将基准利率从9.5%上调至20%，以鼓励民众持有卢布。即使在那时，卢布对美元的汇率也暴跌了30%——如今一卢布价值还不到一美分

The uneven response is unlikely to counterbalance the onslaught of Western anger, but it could test the limits of President Biden’s pledge to make Mr. Putin a “pariah on the international stage.”
这种不平衡的反应不太可能抵消西方愤怒的冲击，但它可能会考验拜登总统让普京成为“国际舞台上被排斥的人”的承诺究竟能够达到何种限度

Indonesia does not see Russia as a threat to global politics or as a foe, Unilateral sanctions limit the chance for negotiation and heightens the sense of insecurity to the affected countries. It would not blindly follow the steps taken by another country.
印尼不把俄罗斯视为全球政治的威胁，也不把俄罗斯视为敌人，单方面制裁限制了谈判的机会，加剧了受影响国家的不安全感。该国“不会盲目追随另一个国家采取的措施”

Now, however, such talk seems naïve. What, after all, are foreign reserves? They aren’t bags of cash. For the most part they consist of deposits in overseas banks and holdings of other governments’ debt. True, Russia also has a substantial amount of physical gold held within the country. 
然而，现在这种说法似乎很幼稚。究竟什么是外汇储备？不是一袋袋现金。在很大程度上，它们包括在海外银行的存款和持有的其他政府债务。诚然，俄罗斯在国内也持有大量实体黄金

As I said, Putin may well take Kyiv. But even if he does, he will have made himself weaker, not stronger. Russia now stands revealed as a Potemkin superpower, with far less real strength than meets the eye.
正如我所说，普京很可能会占领基辅。但即便如此，他也会变得更弱，而不是更强。现在，俄罗斯现出了原形，一个实际实力远不如人们所看到的波将金式超级大国

In the early days of the pandemic in China, the only Covid cases linked to the market appeared to be Lineage B. And because Lineage B seemed to have evolved after Lineage A, some researchers suggested that the virus arrived at the market only after spreading around Wuhan. But that logic is upended by the new Chinese study, which finds both lineages in market samples. The findings are consistent with the scenario that Dr. Worobey and his colleagues put forward, in which at least two spillover events occurred at the market.
在中国新冠病毒大流行的早期，与华南市场有关的确诊病例曾似乎感染的都是B系毒株。而且，因为B系毒株似乎是从A系毒株演化而来的，一些研究人员曾提出，新冠病毒是在武汉其他地方传播后，才在华南市场出现的。但中国的新研究从华南市场的环境样本中找到了这两个系的毒株，推翻了上述逻辑。中国的研究结果与沃洛贝及其同事提出的情形相符，沃洛贝等人认为，至少有两起溢出事件发生在华南市场。

Keep the airspeed, altitude and course steady: That was the mantra for American pilots who regularly encountered Soviet aircraft during the Cold War. And the Soviets often returned the favor. Even though they were adversaries, the Soviet and American pilots abided by a tacit code of conduct, rooted in patterns of predictable behavior. At the end of the day, everyone got home safely.
保持空速、高度和航向：这是冷战期间经常遇到苏联飞机的美国飞行员挂在嘴上的话。苏联人也常常礼尚往来。尽管是对手，但双方的飞行员都遵守着一种隐性的行为准则，它根植于可预测的行为模式。最后，所有人都能安全回家。

Both Russia and the United States conduct drills that replicate various levels of nuclear alert status, so the choreography of such moves is well understood by both sides. A deviation from usual practice would almost certainly be noticeable.
俄美都在模拟不同级别的核戒备状态进行演习，因此，双方都相当了解彼此对这类行动的安排。偏离常规的行为基本肯定会被察觉

It’s what he does, It’s verbal saber-rattling. We’ll see where he goes with it. This war is four days old and he’s already made nuclear threats twice. he said he was willing to put his nuclear forces on alert.
他的作风就是如此，这是口头的武力恫吓。我们要看他实际会怎么做。这场战争已经进行了四天，而他已经两次发出核威胁。他准备好了让他的核力量处于戒备状态

Nuclear-armed states can’t fight nuclear wars because it would risk their extinction, but they can and do threaten it, They play games of nuclear chicken, of raising the risk of war in hopes that the other side will back down and say, ‘Geez, this isn’t worth fighting a nuclear war over.’ Unless we see that kind of thing, it’s rhetoric — it’s madman brinkmanship.
核国家不能打核战，因为这将使其面临灭国的危险，但他们能以此作为威胁，也的确这么做了，他们在玩核版本的懦夫博弈，通过增加战争风险，以期待对方做出让步说，‘算啦，真不值得为此打一场核战。’ 除非我们看到那样的情况，不然这就是说大话——是狂人的战争边缘策略。

They were paying the price of their own rhetoric, that this was a defensive war against fascists and neo-Nazis, But now we have an irritated Kremlin, and we haven’t seen yet what Russia has in store. The world is starting to see stage two, when they go in with heavy artillery and ground troops, We can see a follow-on invasion with more experienced troops, with more forces, fewer precision-guided systems, more attrition, more carpet bombing and more victims.
他们为自己的论调付出了代价，称这是一场针对法西斯和新纳粹分子的防御性战争，但现在我们看到一个被激怒的克里姆林宫，而我们还没有见到俄罗斯的实力. 世界将要开始看到第二阶段，他们将带着重型火炮和地面部队进入，我们会在后续入侵中看到更多经验丰富的部队，更多的军力，更少的精确制导系统，更多的损耗，更多的地毯式轰炸和更多的受害者。

Russia appears to have stumbled in the opening days of the invasion, but Ukraine’s army is still enormously overmatched, and Putin has the power to rain hell on the country
俄罗斯似乎在入侵开始的几天里出师不利，但乌克兰军队仍处于巨大的劣势，普京有能力让这个国家遭殃

Even before the pandemic, Hong Kong’s inequality was staggering. It has more billionaires than any city but New York, yet more than 200,000 residents live in carved-up tenement homes where the average living space per person is 48 square feet.
甚至在疫情之前，香港的不平等现象就令人震惊。它的亿万富翁数量仅次于纽约，然而超过20万名居民住在人均面积4.5平方米的㓥房中

These claims are speculation without any basis, and are intended to blame-shift and smear China. They remain in a de facto alliance against the West at this point.
有关报道中提到的说法纯属猜测，没有任何根据，意在推卸责任，抹黑中国。此时此刻，它们仍处于对抗西方的事实联盟之中

Beyond the answers Mr. Zelensky provided to questions, pulling a chair close to attending journalists, the news conference seemed intended to signal that his battered government is at least still functioning a week into the war, despite increasingly dire conditions in Kyiv.
泽连斯基回答了问题，拉近了与出席记者的距离，除此之外，这次新闻发布会似乎是为了表明在开战一周后，尽管基辅的情况越来越糟糕，其饱受打击的政府至少仍在运作

Mr. Zelensky said he was getting about three hours of sleep a night. His cheeks sagged with weariness. He was, though, animated and gestured energetically to drive home points. Zelensky, who has refused to the flee the country, turning down a reported American evacuation offer. “I need ammunition, not a ride,” he said at the time.
泽连斯基说他每晚睡三个小时左右。他的脸颊因疲倦而下垂。但他精神抖擞并活跃地打着手势表达自己的观点。据报道，泽连斯基拒绝了美国的撤离提议，拒绝逃到国外。“我需要的是弹药，不是顺风车，”他当时说

We must not allow anyone in the Kremlin to get away with misrepresenting our intentions in order to find ex post facto justification for this war of choice. We have no hostility toward the Russian people, and we have no desire to impugn a great nation and a world power. We despair of the decision to send young, innocent Russians into a futile war.
我们绝不允许克里姆林宫有人成功歪曲我们的意图，以便事后为发动这场蓄意之战找借口。我们对俄罗斯人民没有敌意，我们也无意指责一个伟大的国家和一个世界强国。我们对于将年轻、无辜的俄罗斯人送入一场徒劳战争的决定感到绝望

The annual government work report delivered to China’s National People’s Congress did not even mention Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and it took an implacably steady-as-it-goes tone on China’s economic outlook. The implicit message appeared to be that China could weather the turbulence in Europe, and would focus on trying to keep the Chinese population at home contented and employed
向全国人民代表大会提交的年度政府工作报告中根本没有提到俄罗斯对乌克兰的入侵，同时，该文件对中国经济前景采取了坚决的求稳立场。这其中暗含的消息似乎是：中国能够经受住欧洲的动荡，并将致力于让国内人民安居乐业

Many Chinese media organizations admire RT and Sputnik, which they believe have broken the West’s information monopoly, or at least muddied the water. Russia’s military actions are anti-West, anti-NATO expansion and anti-Nazi — thus justified and popular.
许多中国媒体机构钦佩今日俄罗斯和俄罗斯卫星通讯社，他们认为这两家媒体打破了西方的信息垄断，或者至少把水搅浑了. 俄罗斯的军事行动针对的是西方和北约扩张，是反纳粹的，因此是正当和广受欢迎的

The one-two punch is working, keeping the public from facts while sowing confusion. The battalion, a unit of the Ukrainian National Guard, is known for having neo-Nazi sympathizers but remains a fringe presence in the country and its military.
虚假信息与审查的结合已见成效，在让公众不了解事实的同时，也制造了困惑。亚速营是乌克兰国民警卫队的一个支队，人们知道其中有新纳粹的同情者，但这支队伍在乌克兰及其军队一直处于边缘地位

But as the war continues and China recalibrates its position, some Chinese online users have begun to scrutinize the Russian news media reports. some people called out Russia for waging an information war in China. Russia’s external propaganda has infiltrated China out-and-out.
但随着战争的继续以及中国重新调整自己的立场，一些中国网民开始仔细审阅俄罗斯新闻媒体的报道. 有人指出俄罗斯正在中国打一场信息战。俄罗斯外宣把国内渗透的底裤都不剩了

The global system was built in the 1950s, and if you think of it as a car from those years, it is battered, out of date in some ways, and could use a good tuneup, the reappearance of war in Europe is also an omen.
全球体系是在1950年代建立的，如果你把它看成是那个年代出厂的汽车，你会发现它破旧不堪，在某些方面已经过时，可能需要好好调整一下了，欧洲也显露了再次爆发战争的预兆

We have become increasingly indifferent — that’s why the Putin example has been so striking, A lot of people had a comforting and benign view of what a post-American world would look like — it would just be adjusting to other people having different opinions — so for the consequence to be war, it’s shocking to people.
我们变得越来越冷漠——这就是为什么普京的例子如此引人注目，很多人对后美国世界会是什么样子有一种善意而令人宽慰的看法——它只是在适应那些有不同意见的人——所以其后果是战争才会让人们感到震惊

The Biden administration, in an effort to deter Putin, assembled a powerful package of deep and broad economic sanctions and warned the Russian leader that if he invaded Ukraine, he’d be betting his whole farm — the economic viability of his country and regime. Tragically, Putin bet the farm, and the results have been swift and merciless.
拜登政府为了威慑普京，制定了一套极具深度与广度的严厉经济制裁，并警告俄罗斯领导人，如果他入侵乌克兰，他就赌上了全部——他的国家和政权的经济生存能力。不幸的是，普京选择孤注一掷，后果则来得迅速而无情

“It turns out that Russia’s foreign reserves strategy had a major flaw: About half of the money was held overseas in foreign banks — and now Russia can’t get to it” because of the sanctions, noted Fortune. So the ruble savings of many Russians are being ravaged.
 《财富》指出，“事实证明，俄罗斯的外汇储备战略存在重大缺陷：大约一半的资金存放在海外的外国银行里，而现在俄罗斯无法拿到这些钱，”因为俄罗斯受到了制裁。因此，许多俄罗斯人的卢布储蓄正在遭受重创

 In any case, consumer goods are only about a third of Russia’s imports. The rest are capital goods, intermediate goods — that is, components used in the production of other goods — and raw materials. These are things Russia needs to keep its economy running, and their absence may cause important sectors to grind to a halt. There are already suggestions, for example, that the cutoff of spare parts and servicing may quickly cripple Russia’s domestic aviation, a big problem in such a huge country.
 无论如何，消费品只占俄罗斯进口的三分之一左右。其余的是资本货物、中间货物（即用于生产其他货物的部件）和原材料。这些都是俄罗斯维持其经济运行所需要的，它们的缺失可能会导致重要行业的停滞。例如，已经有人提出，切断备件和维修可能会迅速削弱俄罗斯的国内航空，在这样一个大国，这是一个大问题

 Ukraine’s military, which is dwarfed by the Russian force in most ways, has somehow managed to stymie its opponent. Ukrainian soldiers have killed more than 3,000 Russian troops, according to conservative estimates by U.S. officials, and others have surrendered and sabotaged their own vehicles to avoid fighting. To be sure, most military experts say that Russia will eventually subdue Ukraine’s army. 
 与俄军相比，乌克兰军队在很多方面相形见绌，却能设法阻止对手的进攻。据美国官员的保守估计，乌克兰军人已歼灭了3000多名俄罗斯士兵, 还有些士兵已投降，他们为避免战斗破坏了自己的车辆. 诚然，大多数军事专家表示，俄罗斯最终将征服乌克兰军队

He’s damned if he did know, and damned if he didn’t, If he did know and he didn’t tell people, he’s complicit; if he wasn’t told by Putin, it’s an affront. They did not anticipate a full-scale invasion, You do not need to invade Ukraine to get what you want. So why bother? They still want to remain sort of neutral, but they bitterly failed.
他知情还是不知情都无法逃脱谴责，如果他知道，但没有告诉别人，那他是同谋；如果普京没有告诉他，那是对他的冒犯. 他们没有预料到俄罗斯会全面入侵，俄罗斯无需全面入侵乌克兰就能得到想要的东西，所以为什么要自找麻烦呢？他们仍想保持某种中立，但他们彻底失败了

Get serious about defense. The dumbest debate in foreign-policy circles is whether China or Russia is the graver threat. The real answer is that we don’t have the luxury of choosing. But we do have the luxury of spending more on defense. it seemed like a pipe dream.
认真对待国防问题。在外交政策领域，最愚蠢的争论是关于中国还是俄罗斯谁是更严重的威胁。真正的答案是，我们没有选择的余地。但我们确实有增加国防开支的余地. 这似乎是一个白日梦

In restaurants that remain open, bottled water is now served exclusively in plastic bottles. The glass ones are being used to make Molotov cocktails. they might be providing cover for a potential biological or chemical weapons attack
这里仍在营业的餐馆里出售的瓶装水现在都是塑料瓶的。玻璃瓶已被用去做燃烧弹. 他们可能在为发动的潜在生物或化学武器袭击提供掩护

There’s a strong undercurrent of anti-Western sentiment and disposition in a lot of these narratives, They’re questioning U.S. legitimacy
许多这样的叙事都包含了强烈了反西方情绪和倾向，他们的做法是在质疑美国的正当性

Efforts to negotiate a cease-fire to give civilians a chance to escape have failed repeatedly. For three days, the prospect of relief reaching the city though a “humanitarian corridor” fell apart in a hail of mortar and artillery fire.
为了让平民有机会逃脱而进行停火谈判的努力一再失败。三天来，通过“人道主义走廊”到达城市的救援可能性在密集的炮火中破灭了

They drove as far as they could in Irpin, but then Ms. Perebyinis was forced to abandon the minivan. They set out on foot toward a damaged bridge over the Irpin River.
他们在伊尔平尽量开车前进，但后来佩雷贝尼斯女士被迫弃车。他们步行向伊尔平河上一座遭毁坏的桥走去

An identical, slightly cross-eyed version of Holoborodko stands before him. It’s your body double, the prime minister explains. He’s available to appear at ceremonies, to meet with foreign dignitaries … or to take a sniper’s bullet. Of course, the prime minister adds, it probably won’t come to that.
一个长得一样、略微斜视的霍洛博罗德科站在他面前。这是您的替身，总理解释道。他可以在仪式上出现，与外国政要会面，或者替你挡狙击手的子弹。当然，总理说，可能不会发生这种事情

**More satirical than** “The West Wing,” **less caustic than** “Veep,” **with higher stakes than** in “Parks and Recreation,” “Servant of the People” is a **what-if fable** about an **ordinary citizen vaulted into power**. Holoborodko, a history teacher, is caught on camera **ranting about the country’s rampant corruption and cynicism**. But “Servant of the People” is also stranger and more profound than its **fish-out-of-water premise suggests**.

《人民公仆》比《白宫风云》(The West Wing)更具讽刺意味，没有《副总统》(Veep)那么刻薄，比《公园与游憩》(Parks and Recreation)里的利害关系更大，它是一个关于普通公民突然掌权的假设故事。历史老师霍洛博罗德科被拍到大骂国家腐败猖獗且无所顾忌. 但是，《人民公仆》也比它格格不入的假设所暗示的更奇怪，也更深刻

Mr. Zelensky’s appearances throughout the war, from **handmade videos** to interviews, have had **a similar personal feel**. He **wears fatigues**, not a suit.We are here. We are not giving up our home. To the world, it was **David facing Goliath and picking up a digital slingshot**.
>personal feel 个人风格  
>fatigue 疲劳；工作服  
>slingshot[ˈslɪŋˌʃɑt] 弹弓

泽连斯基在整个战争期间的露面，从自拍视频到采访，都有类似的个人风格。他穿着作训服，而不是西装。我们在这里。我们不会放弃我们的家园。对全世界来说，这是对决巨人歌利亚的大卫拿起了数字弹弓

I don’t want Ukraine’s history to be **a legend about 300 Spartans**. He’s not **posturing as Rambo**. If anything, he **accentuates his vulnerability**. He’s tired. He’s **unshaven**.
>accentuate[ækˈsentʃuˌeɪt] 强调；着重；使突出  

我不希望乌克兰的历史变成斯巴达三百勇士的传奇。”他没有摆出兰博的姿态。要说他表达了什么的话，他强调了他的脆弱。他很累。他没有刮胡子。

A group of middle-aged Chinese Australians logged onto Zoom to **step, kick and punch through their regular exercise class** one day late last month. Then they **lingered online to despair at** the government’s attempt to turn China into a campaign weapon.
>regular exercise class 常规健身课

上个月下旬的某天，一群澳大利亚中年华人登录Zoom，上他们的常规健身课。登阶、踢腿、挥拳了一段时间后，他们继续留在网上，对政府试图把中国变成一个竞选武器的做法表达不满和失望

The seven men and women in Melbourne were resigned to the fact that China would become a **political wedge** in the federal election **due by May**. But when Prime Minister Scott Morrison questioned the **allegiance** of a leader of the opposition Labor Party by accusing him of being a “**Manchurian candidate**,” that **felt like a step too far**.
>political wedge 政治楔子

>Manchurian[mænˈtʃʊər·rɪərn] 满族的；中国东北的; 满族人  
>a step too far 太过份；过头了

这七名男女接受了这样一个事实：中国会成为定于今年5月举行的联邦选举的一个政治楔子。但当澳大利亚总理斯科特·莫里森质疑反对党工党的一名领导人的忠诚，指责他是“满洲候选人”时，给人的感觉有点过头了

I was **shocked and surprised** that he would **go so low**, It was **totally uncalled-for and totally un-Australian**. It’s led to **whisper campaigns** against Labor candidates of **Chinese descent** in Sydney. Mr. Morrison — often **celebrated** by American officials for his handling of Beijing — “has **lost control of any prudent or rational dimension** in his approach to China. 
>go so low 这么卑鄙; 如此下作

我很震惊，也感到意外，他竟然会这么卑鄙，这完全有失公允，也完全与澳大利亚的价值观相违. 这已导致了针对悉尼的工党华裔候选人的诋毁运动. 莫里森因其在北京问题的处理而曾经常受美国官员称赞，他“在对待中国的做法上已失去了对谨慎或理性维度的控制”.

The state of grocery stores and pharmacies may be **the starkest illustration** of how this international hub is **buckling** under this Omicron surge. Various **pain medications and Covid testing kits**, according to its website, are **out of stock**. Some other drugstores in the city are out of **sanitary napkins and tampons**. some residents have **panicked**. They have **emptied supermarket shelves** of vegetables and meat.

食品杂货店和药店的情况也许是这个国际中心如何被奥密克戎病例激增压垮的最鲜明例证。各种止痛药和检测试剂盒均已断货。还有一些药店的卫生巾和卫生棉条都已售馨. 民众当中已经开始出现恐慌。他们将超市货架上的蔬菜和肉类抢购一空，把药店里的止痛药和退烧药扫荡干净。那些负担得起的人已乘机离开。

这应该是一个明确态度的时刻, 这想必会有很大的提振作用. 哪怕仅考虑其目前的联合国安理会轮值主席国的地位，阿联酋的立场可能都是最引人注目的

If we are not **violating any international laws**, then nobody should blame Dubai, or the U.A.E., or any other country for trying to **accommodate whoever comes in a legitimate way, So what’s the big deal**? I don’t see why the West would complain.  
如果我们没有违反国际法，那任何人都不应指责迪拜、阿联酋或是任何想要接纳合法入境者的国家，这有什么大不了的？我不明白为什么西方会抱怨

Mr. Yoon and Mr. Lee have been **neck and neck** in most surveys. During much of the campaign, policy discussions **were often drowned out by fractious allegations of legal and moral misconduct** by the two candidates and their families. Yoon is **ignorant**.
