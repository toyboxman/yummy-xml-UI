One fighter tripped on a branch and snapped a flip-flop. A couple of militia members wore body-armor vests, but without the hard ballistic plates that might save their lives.
一名战士被树枝绊倒，碰断了触发器。有几个民兵穿了防弹衣，但没有穿可能挽救他们生命的防弹硬板。

a former hotel banquet coordinator slipped his index finger onto the trigger of an assault rifle. A dentist recalled picking larvae from a young fighter’s infected bullet wound. A marketing manager described the adapted commercial drones she is directing to foil the enemy.
一位曾经的酒店宴会统筹人用食指扣住了突击步枪的扳机。一位牙医回忆起自己如何从年轻战士被感染的枪伤中挑出虫卵。一位营销经理介绍了她正在操纵的用来打击敌人的改装民用无人机

He used to spend his days clarifying beef consommé and grilling the perfect medium-rare steak. While no solid data exists, the number of Tatmadaw desertions appears, anecdotally, to be rising. Even before the coup, soldiers were overstretched and underpaid.
他以前的生活就是整天忙着撇去牛肉汤里的浮沫，将牛排烤至完美的半熟。虽然没有可靠的数据，但据传闻，缅甸军队的逃兵人数似乎正在上升。甚至在政变之前就已经存在兵源和薪水不足的问题

There is just darkness and long minutes of silence when the ticking of battery-powered wall clocks or the grating of open gates in the cold wind are anxiously scrutinized until the next explosion thuds somewhere nearby, rattling windows. And bones.
在黑暗和漫长的静寂中，焦急地聆听着电子钟发出的滴答声，或是寒风中敞开的栅栏门发出的嘎吱声，直到下一次爆炸在附近某个地方响起，震得窗户哗啦作响。连身体里的骨头都在颤抖

Bracketed by rolling wheat and sunflower fields and bisected by the Haichur River, Huliaipole looks and feels like a Soviet-era staple: modest homes and low-slung apartment buildings with spacious tree-lined streets, perfect for an afternoon bicycle ride in another time.
古利艾波列被连绵起伏的小麦和向日葵田环抱，盖丘尔河将其一分为二，它看上去与苏联时代最常见的小镇并无二致：简朴的房屋和低矮的公寓楼，绿树成荫的宽敞街道，也许在另一个时代，非常适合在下午骑自行车出行

He maneuvered his bus over the potholed roads common in Ukraine’s more rural reaches, downshifting to almost a standstill to navigate the larger craters left by overuse and disrepair.
他驾驶着大巴，行驶在乌克兰农村地区常见的坑洼道路上，为了驶过因过度使用和年久失修留下的较大坑洞，他只得减速，有时几乎停下来

India lagged far behind China in opening up its economy, missing out on the early benefits of globalization that turned Beijing into a giant. Ultimately, the real security lies in economic growth and, you know, quickly getting to something close to $10 trillion, Basically what China did.
印度在开放经济方面远远落后于中国，错过了全球化早期的好处，而北京通过全球化成为了经济巨人。归根结底，真正的安全在于经济增长，迅速接近10万亿美元，基本上就是中国所做的事情

As far as the Pentagon is concerned, we are a pin on the map in the Indian Ocean region. We are not that in Europe, where we have no role to play in hard defense terms. The Indian government’s confidence that its divergence from Western pressure on Russia will ultimately not damage its relations is rooted in the fact that India is an important potential check on China’s expansionist foreign policy.
对五角大楼而言，我们是印度洋地区地图上的一个图钉，我们在欧洲没有这样的位置，我们在硬防御方面没有任何角色。印度政府相信，在对俄罗斯施压上，它与西方的分歧最终不会损害关系，根源在于印度是中国扩张主义外交政策的重要潜在制衡者

the aid from the central government was a godsend. Carrie Lam, the local leader, traveled to the border with the mainland to greet the arriving medics with a bow, a sign of deep gratitude rarely used in the city.
中央政府的援助是一场及时雨。当地领导人林郑月娥前往与内地接壤的边境，向抵达的医务人员鞠躬表达深切的感激，这是香港很少采用的表达方式

Russia is in no place to negotiate seriously because they have to do better in the war, This is a chance for the Russians to consolidate, to regroup, to remove themselves from places out of reach logistically, where they have already run out of food and ammunition.
俄罗斯没有正经谈判的资本，因为他们在战争中做得不够好，这是俄罗斯人巩固和重组的机会，让他们可以从后勤上无法到达的地方撤离，在那里他们已经耗尽了食物和弹药

Russia is not negotiating in good faith, but “testing the waters and applying for time, to regroup and re-equip militarily and make more gains on the ground.”
俄罗斯在谈判中没有诚意，而是“在试水，争取时间，重新部署和装备军事力量，在地面战中取得更多进展”

If Ukraine joined now, the country would develop economically even faster, in contrast to Russia, “and you would end up with a South Korea next to a North Korea, and I can’t see Putin accepting that.”
如果乌克兰现在加入，与俄罗斯相比，该国的经济发展速度会更快，“最终就像在朝鲜旁边出现一个韩国，我不觉得普京会接受这一点。”

The experts who examined the men said “the dosage and type of toxin used was likely insufficient to cause life-threatening damage, and most likely was intended to scare the victims as opposed to cause permanent damage”
检查过这些中毒者的专家说，“毒剂的剂量和类型不足以导致危及生命的伤害，很有可能只是为了恐吓受害人，不是想造成永久性伤害”

Reports have emerged of Mr. Zelensky asking President Biden to refrain from sanctioning Mr. Abramovich because of the role he has been playing. It’s the story of good cop, bad cop — there is the official delegation, and Abramovich has a little more freedom.
有报道称，由于他所扮演的角色，泽连斯基曾要求拜登总统不要制裁他。这是个唱红脸白脸的问题——有官方的代表团，也有相对更自由的阿布拉莫维奇

For still others, the city’s Covid-19 restrictions have had life-threatening implications. Some residents have been confined at home, unable to get kidney dialysis or other urgent treatment. A nurse who suffered an asthma attack died after she was denied care by a hospital that cited Covid prevention protocols.
对另外一些人来说，遏制新冠病毒的措施已造成了可能致命的影响。因为不能出门，一些人无法去做血液透析或其他急诊治疗。一名哮喘发作的护士被一家医院因疫情防控停诊为由拒收后死亡

The conventional wisdom is that Vladimir Putin catastrophically miscalculated. He thought his modernized military would make mincemeat of Ukrainian forces. Has he lost contact with reality? Is he physically unwell? Mentally?
人们普遍认为，普京灾难性地误判了局势。他认为他的现代化军队会把乌克兰军队击溃. 他是否与现实失去了联系？他身体不舒服吗？他的精神状态如何？

Then again, in war, politics and life, it’s always wiser to treat your adversary as a canny fox, not a crazy fool. Under the guise of an invasion, Putin is executing an enormous heist
然而，在战争、政治和生活中，把你的对手当作一只狡猾的狐狸，而不是一个疯狂的傻瓜，这总是更明智的做法。普京打着入侵的幌子，正在进行一场巨大的抢劫

Several analysts have compared Putin to a cornered rat, more dangerous now that he’s no longer in control of events. They want to give him a safe way out of the predicament he allegedly created for himself.
一些分析人士把普京比作一只走投无路的老鼠，因为他不再能控制事态，所以更加危险。他们想给他一条安全的出路，让他摆脱所谓的作茧自缚

It could mean that enough time has passed that things have kind of blown over, From a macro perspective, it could mean that China is trying to signal that it still wants to maintain good economic relations with the United States despite differences in opinion on the Russia-Ukraine crisis.
这可能意味着已经时过境迁了，从宏观角度来看，这可能意味着中国试图发出信号，表明尽管在俄乌危机上存在分歧，它仍希望与美国保持良好的经济关系

A year ago, while many countries were still reeling from Covid-19, China seemed to be one of few places prospering through the pandemic. Straddling between two boats will only end up in falling in the water.
一年前，许多国家仍在受新型冠状病毒疾病煎熬时，中国似乎是少数几个在这场大流行病中保持繁荣的地方之一。脚踩两只船只能掉水里。

As the coronavirus races through Shanghai, in the city’s worst outbreak since the pandemic began, the authorities have deployed their usual hard-nosed playbook to try and stamp out transmission, no matter the cost. 
上海暴发了自从新冠病毒大流行开始以来最严重的疫情，随着病毒的迅速传播，当局采取了惯用的严格措施，不惜一切代价，试图阻止病毒传播

Shanghai is China’s most populous metropolis, its shimmering commercial heart. Whatever pride Shanghaiers had taken in their city’s response has morphed into dismay and outrage. Shanghai’s educated, connected population was more primed than people elsewhere in China to be skeptical of the measures, especially given the lesser severity of the Omicron variant. 
上海是中国人口最多的大都市，也是繁华的商业中心。上海人对自己城市的新冠应对曾经有过的自豪现已变成了沮丧和愤怒。与中国其他地方的人口相比，上海受过高等教育且见多识广的人口更容易对封控措施表示怀疑，尤其是在奥密克戎变异株感染的症状不那么严重的情况下

From my 18th-floor window, I can see the koi ponds and gardens below, empty; the hedge maze, empty; the fountain, somehow turned off, its waters unmoving as though in allegiance, in reprieve.
从18楼的窗户望出去，我能看到楼下观赏鱼池和花园空荡荡的；层叠掩映的树篱空无一人；喷泉不知怎地关闭了，水面静止，仿佛在宣誓臣服，在宣告终止

During that lockdown, Wuhan was victim to the mystery virus. Conjectures and rumors abounded. The death rate was high. Lockdown felt necessary. The fear was real. But the two years since then have been blissfully free of the worries of Covid-19. 
在那次封锁期间，神秘的病毒在武汉肆虐。猜测和谣言漫天飞。死亡率很高。感觉封锁很有必要。人们是真的很害怕。但在此后两年时间里，人们摆脱了对新冠疫情的担忧

This most recent infiltration of the Omicron subvariant BA.2 is unnerving because we are so used to a life unaffected by Covid-19. With my son still breastfeeding, stubbornly refusing a bottle and allergic to formula, this would be a nightmare scenario.
最近扩散开来的奥密克戎亚型变异株BA.2令人不安，因为我们已经太过习惯不受新冠影响的生活。我的儿子还在母乳喂养，他怎么都不肯用奶瓶，还对配方奶粉过敏，与他分开将会是一场噩梦

The rollout has been messy. Grocery store shelves have been emptied as residents went on panic buying sprees. People with life-threatening conditions posted calls for help online when they could not get to hospitals for help. Quarantine facilities and hospitals have overflowed with people who tested positive, who must be confined in such facilities even if asymptomatic.
分片封控的推出颇为混乱。随着居民们疯狂购物，杂货店的货架被抢购一空。由于无法去医院治疗，患有致命疾病的人在网上发求救贴。隔离设施和医院里挤满了病毒检测呈阳性者，因为即使没有症状，也必须集中在隔离设施中

Perhaps it was the way the lifeless bodies, bloodied by bullets, and some with hands bound, had been left strewn about or shoveled into makeshift mass graves. Or the reality of seeing them up close in widely circulated photographs and videos.
也许是因为那些或散落在各处、或被铲进乱葬岗的尸体，也许是因为通过广泛传播的照片和视频，人们近距离看到了现实。这些尸体因中枪而血淋淋的，其中一些双手被捆绑

As children, it felt like we were in the military arena, particularly every time the jets overhead latticed the skies with contrails or produced a sonic boom. Even people of modest means in the area built bomb shelters. Armageddon was in the air.
小时候，我们感觉自己就在军事竞技场上，尤其是每次头顶上的喷气式飞机带着凝结尾迹划过天空或产生音爆时。这个地区即使是经济条件有限的人也建造了防空洞。世界末日随时会到来。

The humiliating collapse of the Soviet Union, the video says, was the result of efforts by the United States to destroy its legitimacy. With swelling music and sunny scenes of present-day Moscow, the documentary praises Mr. Putin for restoring Stalin’s standing as a great wartime leader and for renewing patriotic pride in Russia’s past.
这部纪录片称，苏联的耻辱解体是美国破坏其合法性的结果。在欢快音乐和今日莫斯科阳光场景的衬托下，这部纪录片称赞普京恢复了斯大林作为战争时代伟大领导人的地位，以及俄罗斯对本国历史的爱国自豪感

Previous leaders in Moscow — above all Mr. Gorbachev and Nikita S. Khrushchev — are portrayed as dupes, bewitched by the siren song of liberal reform and Western superiority.
苏联的前领导人——尤其是戈尔巴乔夫和赫鲁晓夫——被描绘成傻瓜，被自由主义改革和西方优越性的蛊惑言辞所迷惑

Some countries in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Transcaucasia have become forward positions for the West to contain and meddle in Russia. It was the United States that personally lit the fuse of the present conflagration between Russia and Ukraine, There’s an ‘either we hang together or we hang separately’ attitude that comes into play.
东欧、中亚和外高加索的一些国家也成为西方遏制、干涉俄罗斯的前沿阵地。乌克兰今日战火的‘导火索’正是由美国亲手点燃的，这个运动灌输的是‘要么保持一致，要么全都完蛋’的态度

We don’t see global American leadership anymore. Instead, we rather find it feckless and helpless. We even get skeptical whether we should rely entirely on the United States on issues that relate directly to our survival and prosperity.
我们看不到美国的全球领导地位了。相反，我们认为它既无能又无助，我们甚至怀疑，我们是否应该在关乎自身生存和繁荣的问题上完全依赖美国

Most recently, Mr. Navalny’s team reported that it had linked crew members on a $700 million superyacht to the same Kremlin protective detail, amid speculation that the vessel, whose ownership is obscured by offshore shell companies, was secretly used by Mr. Putin. The 459-foot yacht, named the Scheherazade, has two helicopter pads and is topped with a cluster of satellite domes. It is currently dry-docked in Italy.
最近，纳瓦尔尼的团队报告称，一艘价值7亿美元的超级游艇上的船员与克里姆林宫的安保人员有关联。有人猜测，这艘被离岸空壳公司掩盖了所有权的游艇曾被普京秘密使用。这艘459英尺（约合140米）的游艇名为“山鲁佐德号”，有两个直升机停机位，顶部有一组卫星天线。它目前停在意大利的干船坞

The yacht, estimated to cost $35 million to $50 million in 2002 and reportedly outfitted with marble baths, extensive gilding and a Jacuzzi, was said to be “managed by Unicom,” a Cyprus-based company. The Olympia, which sails under a Cayman Islands registration, was last known to be in the Baltic Sea near St. Petersburg.
这艘游艇在2002年价值约为3500万到5000万美元，据称配备了大理石浴缸和一个按摩浴缸，金碧辉煌的内饰，并且据信“由Unicom管理”，这是一家塞浦路斯公司。奥林匹亚号是在开曼群岛注册的，最后一次出现是在圣彼得堡附近的波罗的海海域

Increasing availability of data about people and their movements would make it easier to track down individuals responsible for war crimes. But it could also make it hard for civilians to lie low in tense environments. In a world of more and more data being gathered, everyone leaves a trail of dots that can be connected.
人们及其行动的数据越来越容易获得，这将使追踪犯下战争罪行的个人变得更容易。但这也让平民更加难以在紧张的环境中藏身. 在一个收集越来越多数据的世界里，每个人都会留下可以连接起来的线索

Faces can look similar, so secondary information, in the form of an identifying mark, a tattoo or clothing, is important to confirm a match. Whether that will happen in a tense, wartime situation is an open question
面孔可能看起来相似，因此识别胎记、纹身或衣服的辅助信息对于确认匹配很重要。但在紧张的战时局势中是否能够做到还不得而知

He fashioned his first light-up cubes by inserting basic electronics into a rubber toothbrush cover. He sold his wares to local bars that stuck the cubes into cocktail glasses. When the light went out, the bartender could tell with a glance that the customer was ready for a refill.
他把基础电子元件塞进一个橡胶牙刷头保护头里，做出了他的第一个发光小方块。他把这套小玩意卖给了当地的酒吧，他们把这些小方块放进鸡尾酒杯。当灯熄灭时，酒保就知道，该续杯了

Then Glo heard via Facebook from an unexpected customer, the mother of a 4-year-old boy who was autistic. Bath time had been a perpetual nightmare. Her son suffered from sensory overload and was terrified by the sound of rushing water. When she deposited a Glo cube into the bath, he was transfixed. It diverted him from his fears.
后来，Glo公司通过Facebook接触到一个意外的顾客，那是一个四岁男童的妈妈，她的儿子患有自闭症。洗澡时间从来都是噩梦。因为感官超负荷，她的儿子会被水流冲刷的声音吓到。当她把一个Glo小方块放进浴缸中时，他惊奇地怔住了。这个小方块使他摆脱了恐惧

In the third major case already on the court’s docket for its next term, the justices will consider the role race may play in drawing voting maps. The court may have tipped its hand in February
至于已被最高法院列入下个庭期日程的第三桩重头案件，大法官们将要考量种族对选举地图划分可能发挥的作用。今年2月，最高法院可能已经亮明态度

The court’s liberals were in dissent when the court issued its provisional order in February, and they are likely to be in the same position when the court rules on the merits of the case
最高法院在2月发布临时判决时，自由派大法官提出了不同意见，因此，等到最高法院对此案的是非曲直做出裁决，这些大法官的立场应该不会改变

As for the real work of the court, justices say it can take quite some time to feel comfortable. I was frightened to death for the first three years, So extraordinary an intellect as Brandeis said it took him four or five years to feel that he understood the jurisprudential problems of the court, That could make Judge Jackson not only a pathbreaking justice but also an influential and consequential one.
至于最高法院的实际工作，大法官们都声称，可能需要相当长的一段时间才能适应。头三年我都过得战战兢兢，才智那样非凡的布兰代斯都说过，他花了四五年时间才觉得自己弄明白了最高法院的法学问题，杰克逊法官不仅有机会成为一位开创性的大法官，她还可能产生深远且重大的影响

We will first make the pie bigger, and then divide it properly through reasonable institutional arrangements, As a rising tide lifts all boats, everyone will get a fair share from development.
要先把‘蛋糕’做大，然后通过合理的制度安排把‘蛋糕’分好，水涨船高、各得其所，让发展成果更多更公平惠及全体人民

Indeed, the Civil War initially created a “cotton famine” that threw thousands of Britons out of work. In the end, of course, Britain stayed neutral — in part because British workers saw the Civil War as a moral crusade against slavery and rallied to the Union cause despite their suffering.
的确，南北战争在一开始的时候的确造成了一场“棉荒”，导致成千上万的英国人失业。当然，英国最终保持了中立——一定程度上是因为英国工人将南北战争视为反对奴隶制的道德圣战，尽管遭受痛苦，他们还是团结起来支持联邦的事业

I do not miss the lost things, the ruined house. I don’t care that I have a loan on the TV, which I will never watch again. It’s all so mundane and devalued by the war itself. But I miss so very much my special world which Mariupol was for me. The city always had a special smell. During winters, it was a bitter aroma of frozen grapes, which were left on the vine, mixed with a touch of smoke emanating from family houses. During summer, it was filled with the smell of dust settled to the ground by the long-awaited rains. And in the spring … what a beautiful city it was in the spring.
我不怀念失去的东西，毁坏的房子。我不在乎我贷款买的电视，我再也不会看了。这些都不算事，在战争面前不值一提。但我太想念我独有的世界了，马里乌波尔对我来说就是这样的世界。这个城市总有一种特别的味道。冬天的时候，是一种留在藤上的冻葡萄的苦味，混合着来自千家万户的淡淡烟味。一到夏天，这里充满了期待已久的雨水冲刷尘埃的气息。而到了春天……春天的城市是多么美丽

This is also known as the first rule of holes: When you’re in one, stop digging. The second rule of modern warfare playing out in Ukraine, “is that finding always beats flanking. If you can locate the enemy first, you can take him out. 
这也就是已经身陷坑洞时的首要原则。当你已经在坑里时，就不要再挖下去了。在乌克兰上演的现代战争的第二条规则是，“寻找总是胜过包抄”。如果你能先找到敌人，就能先干掉对方。

The Ukrainian observer corps is made up of babushkas and kids and anyone else who has got a smartphone, And they’ve been calling in the locations of where the Russian units are and where they’re moving. Grandmas with iPhones can trump satellites.
乌克兰的侦查团由老年女性、孩子和任何有智能手机的人组成，他们一直在报告俄罗斯部队的位置和他们的移动方向。拥有苹果手机的老奶奶可以胜过卫星

It is not such a far-fetched scenario: According to Kevin Rudd’s penetrating and sensible new account of the United States-China relationship, some reports have shown Washington losing to Beijing as many as 19 straight times in desktop war games simulating a conflict over Taiwan.
这样的场景并非信口开河：根据陆克文对美中关系深刻而明智的新描述，一些报告显示，华盛顿在台湾冲突的推演中连续输给北京多达19次。

Already the post-World War II order that underpinned the American Century appears to be fraying, with 19th-century-style power politics supplanting it. In conveying all this, Rudd structures his book like a white paper or policy brief — full of useful facts and trenchant analysis. 
支撑美国世纪的“二战”后秩序似乎正在瓦解，取而代之的是19世纪风格的强权政治. 在表述这一切的过程中，陆克文这本书的结构就像一份白皮书或政策概要——充满了有用的事实和犀利的分析

Europe could help cushion the world against American dominance, an especially potent message when the Trump administration disavowed the Paris climate accord and put tariffs on some European goods. stick-to-the-script responses on Ukraine may reflect worries that Europe expects too much from Beijing. The Ukraine crisis must be properly handled, but we must not turn to reckless remedies in desperation
欧洲可以在帮助世界抵御美国的主导地位上起缓冲作用，当特朗普政府让美国退出巴黎气候协定，并对欧洲的一些商品征收关税时，这是一个特别有力的信息, 照本宣科的回应可能证实了一些担忧，即欧洲对中国期望过高. 乌克兰危机要妥善处置，但不能病急乱投医

Now the bargain is broken, the illusion has shattered. And the country has been pitched into a new phase. But what is it? Putin is so convinced that he cannot afford to lose, that he will escalate, He has staked everything on it.
现在这种妥协中止了，幻想破灭了。俄罗斯已进入一个新阶段。是什么样的阶段？普京深信他承受不起失败，他会升级，他押上了一切

On Ukraine, it’s a level above that — just the extent to which they have parroted some pretty specific and in some cases pretty far-fetched claims from Russia.
在乌克兰问题上，这种共有已超出了以前的水平，仅从他们鹦鹉学舌般地重复俄罗斯一些相当具体、在某些情况下相当难以置信的主张的程度来看。

In an example on Wednesday, an official with Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted a doctored photo appearing to show Nazis holding a flag with a swastika next to flags of Ukraine
上周三有一个例子，外交部的一名官员在Twitter上发了一张被篡改过的照片，上面似乎是纳粹分子们拿着印有纳粹十字标志的旗帜以及乌克兰的国旗

State media video showed a spacious riverside apartment with shiny wooden floors, a living room furnished with a white five-seat sofa, a spacious bedroom, a kitchen with an L-shaped counter and a six-person dining table. The apartment also has a study, along with a veranda that offered a view of downtown Pyongyang. The images showed no sign of a TV. (The value of the apartment wasn’t immediately clear. The total number of bedrooms and square footage were unknown.)
官方媒体的视频显示，这是一间宽敞的河滨公寓，铺着光亮的木地板，客厅里摆着一张白色的五座沙发，卧室宽敞，厨房里有一个L形柜台和一张六人餐桌。公寓里还有一间书房，以及一个可以俯瞰平壤市中心的阳台。图像中没有显示电视存在的迹象。（目前该公寓的价值不详。卧室的总数和面积也不清楚。）

Mr. Kim said, according to the state media, “There is nothing to spare for national treasures like Ri Chun-hee, who has led a virtuous life with the revolutionary microphone.” He also asked her to continue vigorously serve as the voice of his ruling Workers’ Party. As for Ms. Ri, she said that she was “so grateful for the benevolent care of the party” that she and her family were “moved to tears.”
据朝鲜官方媒体报道，金正恩说，“对李春姬这样的国宝要毫不吝啬，她以革命的话筒过着正直的生活。”他还要求她继续积极地为执政的劳动党发声。至于李春姬，她说自己“非常感谢党对她的亲切关怀”，她和家人“感动得流下了泪水”

The fluorescent lights were glaring but she tried to get some rest. She woke up the next morning to find her hall suddenly crammed with people. There was no tap for running water and no showers, so each day she and others would crowd around several fresh water machines, waiting to fill up the pink plastic wash basins they had been given. 
日光灯很刺眼，但她还是试着休息一下。第二天早上醒来，发现大厅里突然挤满了人。没有自来水，也不能淋浴，所以她和其他人每天都会围着几台饮水机，给发的粉红色塑料洗脸盆加水

If the virus mutates globally, as it did with Omicron, and you have “a less than effective vaccine, virtually no natural immunity in the population, and millions of elderly unvaccinated, you’re in a bad place and there is no easy way out.” The moral of this story? You can’t fool around with or propagandize away Mother Nature; she’s merciless.
如果病毒像奥密克戎那样在全球范围内发生变异，而你的“疫苗效果不佳，人口几乎没有天然免疫力，又有数以百万计的老年人没打疫苗，那么你的处境就会非常糟糕，而且没有轻松的出路”。本文的寓意何在？人不能妄想着愚弄或欺骗大自然；她是无情的。

And it is impossible to exaggerate how incompetent the Russian Navy had to be to allow the command warship of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, the Moskva missile cruiser, to be so badly damaged, reportedly by two Ukrainian-made anti-ship cruise missiles, called Neptunes, that the Moskva sank into the sea off Ukraine last week 
俄罗斯海军居然能让他们的黑海舰队指挥舰“莫斯科号”导弹巡洋舰受到严重损伤——据报道是被乌克兰制造的两枚名为“海王星”的反舰巡航导弹击中，这艘舰艇上周在乌克兰附近海域沉没

So I pity the commander who had to tell Putin that Russia’s meanest, monstrous warship in the Black Sea, rumored to have been his favorite, had been sunk by a Ukrainian missile fired in war for the first time.
那位据说深得普京器重的指挥官，现在要去告诉他，俄罗斯在黑海最凶悍、最庞大的战舰，被乌克兰的一种首次在战场上使用的导弹击沉了，我还是挺同情这位指挥官的

His online business selling green bean cake — a local specialty — was suffering from China’s rolling restrictions. Every aspect of business is affected by the pandemic, It’s tough, but it is what it is.
他在网上销售当地特产绿豆糕的生意正受到中国各地纷纷封控的影响。疫情就生意各个方面都受到影响，难是挺难，但没办法

China’s economy expanded 4.8 percent in the first three months of this year compared to the same period last year. That pace was barely faster than the final three months of last year, and it also obscured a looming problem.
今年前三个月，中国经济同比增长4.8%。这一增速仅比去年最后三个月略快，它还掩盖了一个迫在眉睫的问题
