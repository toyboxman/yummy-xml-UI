Russia needs every dollar of export revenue it can get right now. It is lurching toward default on its foreign debt. Much of Russia’s oil is very heavy, producing extra diesel when refined.
俄罗斯现在需要它能获得的每一美元出口收入。俄罗斯的外债正一步步走向违约。俄罗斯的大部分石油都很重，精炼后会产生更多柴油

All of that construction will require huge fleets of diesel-guzzling trucks, excavators, pile drivers, bulldozers and other equipment.
所有这些建设都将需要庞大的柴油车队、挖掘机、打桩机、推土机和其他设备。

By 2020, the Baluch insurgency had been greatly weakened by years of counterinsurgency operations, rifts among separatist groups, fatigue and government incentives for the militants to lay down their weapons.
到2020年，由于多年的平叛行动、分离主义团体之间的分歧、反叛势力的疲态，以及政府对武装分子放下武器的激励措施，俾路支的叛乱活动已被大幅削弱

But as the pandemic and the war in Ukraine continue to weigh on trade and business ties, that period of plenty appears to be undergoing a partial reversal. If it lasts, such a shift away from fine-tuned globalization could have important implications for inflation and the world’s economy.
但随着疫情和乌克兰战争持续影响贸易和商业关系，这种繁荣时期似乎正在发生部分逆转。如果这种情况持续下去，意味着从经过精心优化的全球化脱离出来，这样的趋势会对通胀和世界经济产生重要影响

Computers and other technology made factories more efficient, and they chugged out sneakers, kitchen tables and electronics at a pace unmatched in history. Companies slashed their production cost by moving factories offshore, where wages were lower. The pandemic also exposed the snowball effect of highly optimized supply chains
电脑和其他技术提高了工厂的效率，它们以史上无与伦比的速度生产运动鞋、厨房桌和电子产品。企业将工厂转移到工资更低的海外，从而削减生产成本, 这场疫情还暴露出高度优化的供应链的滚雪球效应

Many economists expect price increases for durable goods to cool substantially in the months ahead, which should help calm overall price gains. 
许多经济学家预计，未来几个月耐用品价格涨幅将大幅降温，这应该有助于平抑整体价格涨幅。

Customers are now future-proofing their supply chains, Some reshoring is occurring — let’s make no mistake about that
客户“现在正在为他们的供应链寻找抵抗未来风险的保障”。一些产业正在回流，这一点是毋庸置疑的。

Countless facts tell us that we can win respect and initiative only if we show the spirit of brave fighters defeating our foes face to face on a narrow path, daring to struggle, mastering struggle. Persist with dynamic zero, protecting people’s lives and health to the maximum extent, while reducing the impact of the pandemic on economic and social development to a minimum
无数事实告诉我们，唯有以狭路相逢勇者胜的气概，敢于斗争、善于斗争，我们才能赢得尊严、赢得主动. 坚持动态清零，最大程度保护人民生命安全和身体健康，最大限度减少疫情对经济社会发展的影响

The draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade that leaked Monday night is not yet final. But when the dust settles, American women may conclude that they had lost the right to abortion the same way that an Ernest Hemingway character said he had gone bankrupt: gradually, and then suddenly.
周一晚间泄露的最高法院推翻罗诉韦德案的意见书草案并非最终版本。但待尘埃落定时，美国的女性可能会得出结论，她们已经失去了堕胎的权利，就像海明威笔下的一个人物形容他的破产一样：先是逐渐地，然后突然就身无分文了

Now, as the rest of the world has dropped border controls and restarted business, that distinction has largely evaporated, and Taiwan risks losing out on tourism and investment by continuing to stay closed.
现在，随着世界其他地区取消边境管制，重启商业活动，这种差异基本消失，而台湾如果继续封闭，可能给旅游业和投资造成损失

Taiwan was still hoarding toilet paper and maintaining armies of workers in head-to-toe protective suits while the rest of the world was seemingly moving on? It makes me very sad and pissed about where I am, seeing people elsewhere living a normal life.
台湾为何还在囤积卫生纸，还让大批工作者从头到脚穿着防护服. 看到别处的人过着正常的生活，这让我对自己的处境非常难过，也非常气愤

His rise to the top leadership position is “a concentrated embodiment of public opinion,” But he will also face a city embattled by the coronavirus and some of the world’s toughest pandemic restrictions.
他当选行政长官“是民意的集中体现”，但他将面对的也是一个受新冠病毒大流行和世界上一些最严格的限制措施所困扰的城市。

Iran has completely stacked the election committee with its loyalists and further twisted the process into a meaningless competition
伊朗让选举委员会全是听自己话的人，进一步将这个过程扭曲为一次毫无意义的竞选

The lines begin forming before lunchtime and wind on well into the night, with customers outside craning their necks for views of the day’s selection through the window. It is not a newly anointed Michelin bistro or the latest photogenic, Instagram-friendly confection that has captivated Hong Kong, a famously epicurean city. It is a humble takeout box of white rice and two precooked main dishes of the diner’s choosing. The price: around $4.
午餐时间开始前，队伍就排起来了，一直持续到深夜。餐厅外面的顾客伸着脖子透过窗户查看当天的菜品。这不是刚刚得到米其林垂青的餐馆，也不是最新一道俘获美食城市香港的网红甜点。这是一个简朴的外卖盒，白米饭配用餐者自选的两道预先做好的菜。价格约4美元左右

Until now, she has had comparatively little to say about Ukraine, but her full-throated call for an end to the war on Sunday was a departure that reflected the bolder and broader steps the Biden administration has taken to move against Russian aggression without engaging Moscow in an all-out war.
到目前为止，她在乌克兰问题上的发言相对较少，但她在周日全力呼吁结束战争是一个起点，表明拜登政府在不与莫斯科全面开战的情况下，为打击俄罗斯侵略所采取的更大胆、更广泛的措施

Dr. Biden’s work was in the tradition of other first ladies who had traveled oversees to witness the “personification of pain,” hearing stories of trauma and war, all while staying within the limits of an unelected role within the administration. There’s real finesse to this, Because you’ve got to carry all of those memories with you. It’s hard work.
拜登博士的工作沿袭了其他第一夫人的传统，她们前往海外见证“苦难的化身”，聆听创伤和战争的故事，同时保持一个政府内部的非民选角色。这是需要真正的技巧的，因为那些记忆将伴你一生。这是一项艰难的工作

If economists are so smart, why ain’t they rich? I’m not an economist, so the question doesn’t ruffle my feathers. The possible explanations, though, are interesting — sometimes funny, sometimes kind of deep.
如果经济学家这么聪明，为什么他们不富有？我不是经济学家，所以我没有被这个问题激怒。不过，一些可能的解释很有趣——有时很好笑，有时有点深奥

in the 1970s, senior faculty members were speculating in the bond market. Milton Friedman told her that interest rates were bound to fall. They in fact rose to 10 percent soon after, “and the wise economists lost their shirts.”
1970年代在芝加哥大学时，资深教员们正在投机债券市场。米尔顿·弗里德曼告诉她，利率必然会下降。不久之后“实际上升到了10%”，“深谋远虑的经济学家们输得精光。”

I don’t pay any attention to what economists say, frankly. You have all these economists with these 160 IQs who spent their life studying it. Can you name me one super-wealthy economist who’s ever made money out of securities?
坦率地说，我并不在意经济学家怎么说。有那么多智商160的经济学家穷极一生研究经济学。你能说出有哪位经济学家曾经通过在证券市场赚钱成为超级富豪吗？

Buffett is right that economics isn’t an ideal way to make money as an investor. On the other hand, that’s not what it’s for. It’s a science of means and ends. Let economists be economists!
巴菲特是对的，经济学并不是作为投资者赚钱的理想方式。另一方面，这也不是经济学的用途。这是一门关于手段和目的的科学。让经济学家做经济学家吧！

It didn’t quite work as intended. Inflation never met the government’s modest target, despite rock-bottom interest rates and heaps of fiscal stimulus. Workers’ wages stagnated, and growth remained anemic.
但事与愿违。尽管利率处于最低水平并且有大量财政刺激措施，通胀始终未能达到政府的保守目标。工人工资停滞不前，增长依然乏力

The twin forces are posing yet another challenge for the world’s third-largest economy as Japan trails other major nations in emerging from the economic blow of the pandemic. The rise in prices has spooked Japanese consumers used to decades of stability, and the weak yen is starting to look as if it will depress demand at home more than stimulate it abroad.
随着各国都在努力摆脱大流行带来的经济打击，日本在这一方面落后于其他国家，而这两种力量对这个世界第三大经济体构成了又一挑战。日本消费者几十年来习惯了稳定的物价，价格上涨已经吓坏了他们，而疲软的日元看起来似乎会抑制国内需求，而不是刺激国外需求

A Bank of Japan report released in January found that although a weak yen continued to aid the economy, its positive impact on exports had shrunk over the decade leading up to the pandemic.
日本央行1月发布的一份报告发现，尽管日元疲软继续对经济有所帮助，但其对出口的积极影响在大流行之前的十年中已经减弱

High inflation is politically toxic, and trying to correct for it, the medicine, is also an extremely bitter pill, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has brushed off suggestions that the Bank of Japan should seek to strengthen the yen by raising interest rates. Instead, he has sought to combat rising prices with more stimulus. 
高通胀在政治上是有毒的，而试图纠正它的良药，也是一颗极其苦涩的药丸，日本首相岸田文雄没有理会对日本央行应寻求通过提高利率来强化日元的建议。相反，他试图通过更多刺激措施来应对价格上涨

Ultimately, they struggled against a powerful political family that was adept at building alliances and avoiding any semblance of accountability.The country’s school textbooks gloss over the atrocities of the Marcos era. He should not be judged by the sins of his dad. Mr. Duterte, an ally of the Marcoses, had paved the way for a full rehabilitation of the Marcos name.
最终，他们对抗的是一个强大的政治家族，擅长拉帮结派，规避任何形式的问责。该国的教科书掩盖了马科斯时代的暴行。他不应该因为父亲的罪过而受到刁难。杜特地是马科斯家族的盟友，为马科斯家族的东山再起铺平了道路。

Yoon Suk-yeol, the new president of South Korea, was sworn into office in Seoul on Tuesday, using his inaugural speech to make promises to heal political and economic divides at home, to fight for international norms and to offer an ambitious package of economic incentives to North Korea. Mr. Yoon has vowed to align his country more closely with Washington while also mending fractured ties with Japan.
韩国新任总统尹锡悦周二在首尔宣誓就职。他在就职演讲中承诺弥合国内的政治和经济分歧，为国际规范而战，并将向朝鲜提供一套雄心勃勃的经济激励方案。尹锡悦已郑重宣布，将让韩国与华盛顿更紧密地结盟，同时修补与日本破裂的关系。

Mr. Yoon, 61, won the March 9 election with a razor-thin margin against his rival. ​He faces myriad challenges at home. During the campaign, Mr. Yoon was accused of pandering to widespread sentiment against China as well as an anti-feminist movement led by young South Korean men. During the campaign, Mr. Yoon threatened “pre-emptive strikes” against North Korea should an attack look imminent.
在今年3月9日的大选中，61岁的尹锡悦以微弱优势击败对手。尹锡悦在国内面临着众多挑战，在竞选期间，有人指责尹锡悦迎合普遍的反华情绪，迎合由韩国年轻男性领导的反女权运动。他曾在竞选期间威胁说，如果有朝鲜即将发动攻击的迹象，将对其进行“先发制人的打击”。

Rapid growth will open up new opportunities, It will improve social mobility, thereby helping us rid of the fundamental obstacles that are aggravating social divide and conflicts.
快速的经济增长将带来新的机会，提高社会流动性，从而帮助我们消除正在加剧社会分化和冲突的根本障碍

One field on the flat plains east of Beijing was patchy, with knee-high emerald stalks in some spots while almost bald elsewhere, damaged by the torrential rains of last autumn. The next village over, a luxurious wheat crop was thriving after this spring’s bright sunshine and slow, soaking rains.
北京东部的平原上，有一片田地斑驳陆离，有些地方，翠绿的茎干高至膝盖，也有些地方几乎是光秃秃的，这都是去年秋天的暴雨造成的破坏。隔壁村庄里，在今春的明媚阳光和绵绵细雨滋润下，一大片小麦正茁壮成长。

If the Chinese harvest is bad in the coming weeks, it could drive food prices up further, compounding hunger and poverty in the world’s poorest countries. Russia’s invasion, including a blockade of ports, has disrupted supplies from Ukraine, a leading grain exporter long known as Europe’s breadbasket.
如果中国未来几周的收成不好，可能会进一步推高食品价格，加剧世界最贫穷国家的饥饿和贫困。俄罗斯的入侵，包括对乌克兰港口的封锁，扰乱了从乌克兰发出的粮食供应。乌克兰是一个主要粮食出口国，长期以来被称为欧洲粮仓。

Deluges last autumn left the soil so waterlogged that the wheat roots could not easily penetrate it, said Ren Ruixia, a 45-year-old farmhand, as she surveyed a wheat field that looked like it had a bad haircut. The adequacy of food supplies has long been a top issue in China, agriculture ministry officials have issued warnings, although not quite as downbeat.
今年45岁的农工任瑞霞在查看一片看起来像剪坏了发型的麦田时说，去年秋天的大雨让土壤积水严重，小麦的根部不易穿透。长期以来，充足的粮食供应在中国一直是首要问题，农业部官员也发出了警告，尽管没有那么悲观。

China’s nervousness about its food stocks could ripple through the global supply chain. China’s next move will come down to the harvest. Much depends on how well drained their fields are, but everyone agreed that the rain last autumn had been remarkable. In Pingyao, the centuries-old city walls, made with mud cores, collapsed after they became sodden last fall.
中国对粮食库存的紧张情绪可能会波及全球供应链。中国接下来会怎么做，将取决于收成情况。这在很大程度上取决于各家农田的排水情况，但每个人都认为去年秋天的雨水太多了。在古城平遥，去年秋天的降水导致泥砖砌成的城墙坍塌。

The crop was planted unusually late, after the autumnal equinox, the traditional last day of planting in the area. But in recent years the weather has been staying warm later, so the wheat has a chance to germinate before winter frosts force it into dormancy.
这种作物的种植时间非常晚，在秋分过后，而秋分是该地区传统上播种的最后日子。不过近些年来，天气要很晚才开始变冷，所以小麦有机会在冬季霜冻迫使其进入休眠状态之前发芽。

So far, the fissures are mostly superficial: Hungary’s refusal to sign on to an embargo of Russian oil, thwarting the European Union’s effort to impose a continentwide ban; restiveness in Paris with the Biden administration’s aggressive goal of militarily weakening the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin; a beleaguered President Biden blaming sky-high food and gas prices on a Putin price hike. Alongside those tensions, there are further signs of solidarity
到目前为止，分歧大多是表面的：匈牙利拒绝签署对俄罗斯石油禁运的协议，这挫败了欧盟在整个欧洲大陆实施禁运的努力；巴黎对拜登政府在军事上削弱俄罗斯总统普京的强硬目标感到不安；陷入困境的拜登总统将食品和天然气价格居高不下归咎于普京的提价。除了这些紧张局势，还有更多团结起来的迹象

As the fighting grinds on, the cascading effect on supply chains, energy pipelines and agricultural harvests will be felt more acutely at gas pumps and on supermarket shelves. especially if the price for the West’s continued support is turbocharged inflation rates, energy disruptions, depleted public finances and fatigued populations.
随着战争继续，人们将在加油站和超市货架上更敏锐地感受到它对供应链、能源管道和农业收成造成的连带影响。尤其是如果西方继续提供支持，就意味着要付出通胀率急剧上升、能源供应中断、公共财政枯竭和人心疲惫的代价。

French diplomats with ties to Mr. Macron described the evolving American policy as essentially arming Ukraine to the hilt and maintaining sanctions on Russia indefinitely. France, they said, wants to push hard for negotiations with Mr. Putin because there was no other path to lasting European security.
与马克龙有联系的法国外交官将美国不断演变的政策描述为实质上是在从头到脚武装乌克兰，并无限期地维持对俄罗斯的制裁。他们说，法国希望大力推动跟普京的谈判，因为没有其他途径可以实现欧洲的持久安全。

Other analysts argue that the threats to Western unity are overdone. The moves by Finland and Sweden to join NATO suggest not only that the alliance is pulling together but also that its center of gravity is shifting eastward.
另有分析人士认为，西方国家的团结受到威胁的看法有些夸张了。芬兰和瑞典加入北约的举动不仅表明北约正在团结起来，而且其重心正在向东转移。

We tend to think of corruption as a failure of morality, when a greedy person decides to benefit by steering public resources toward private gain. But while that’s not exactly untrue, it misses the most important thing: namely, that corruption is a group activity. You need bribe-payers and bribe-takers, resource-diverters and resource-resellers, look-the-other-wayers and demand-a-share-of-the-takers.
我们倾向于认为腐败是道德的失败，是一个贪婪的人决定将公共资源用于私人利益。但是，尽管这种观点并非完全错误，但它忽略了最重要的一点：腐败是一种群体活动。你需要贿赂者和受贿者，资源分流者和资源转售者，另辟蹊径者和要求分一勺羹者。

What is different with systemic corruption is that it’s the expected behavior, Those who refuse to participate in the parallel economy of favors and bribes get passed over for promotion, cut off from benefits, and frozen out of power. Meanwhile, those who are skilled at corruption rise through the ranks, gaining more authority, more resources to distribute to cronies, and more ability to punish anyone who poses a threat to them. The result is a system where power and wealth accrue to those willing to play the corruption game, and those who are not get left behind.
系统性腐败的不同之处在于，它是人们预期中的行为. 如果拒绝参与这种人情和贿赂的并行经济，就会被排除在晋升之外，被剥夺福利，被冻结在权力之外。与此同时，擅长腐败的人会步步高升，获得更多权力，拥有更多资源分配给亲信，更有能力惩罚任何对他们构成威胁的人。其结果是，权力和财富流向那些愿意参与腐败游戏的人，而那些不愿意参与腐败游戏的人则被抛在后面。

The narratives Mr. Putin has been spinning to justify his war in Ukraine are very much in line with the grand, nostalgic narratives of Victory Day. Victory Day military parades in major Russian cities are followed by marches of ordinary citizens carrying pictures of relatives who fought in the war. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, take part in “Immortal Regiment” marches honoring the soldiers and civilians who fought and died in the war. On Red Square, the event also features a display of historical military weapons, modern tanks and missile systems and other expressions of Russian military grandeur.
普京一直在为他入侵乌克兰辩护，故意按照胜利日宏大、怀旧的叙事来描述这场战争。俄罗斯的主要城市都将举行胜利日阅兵式，随后是举着参加“二战”亲人照片的普通市民的游行。每年，即使没有百万，也是数十万人参加“不朽团”游行，纪念“二战”中作战和死亡的士兵和平民。红场上还有展示历史上的军事武器、现代的坦克和导弹系统，以及其他显示俄罗斯军队气势的活动。

The shift from general to limited conquest was already a concession on Russia’s part. The Russian leadership has blamed a single factor: It claims to be fighting not just Ukraine but the NATO system in Eastern Europe. Hubris and clumsy tactics are more to the point. Negotiations between Ukraine and Russia were always fraught but contained moments of promise. They have now stalled completely. Russia bears its fair share of responsibility, of course. But European channels to Moscow have been all but severed
从全面征服到有限征服，这一转变已经是俄罗斯方面的让步。俄罗斯领导层归咎于一个因素：它声称不仅要与乌克兰作战，还要与东欧的北约体系作战。更恰当的解释应该是傲慢和笨拙的策略。俄乌之间的谈判一直剑拔弩张，但并非没有让人看到希望的瞬间。然而现在谈判完全停滞了。对此俄方当然要负一部分责任。但欧洲与莫斯科的沟通渠道已经悉数切断

even staunch Ukrainian nationalists expressed views far more pragmatic than those that are routine in America now. Talk of neutral status for Ukraine and internationally monitored plebiscites in Donetsk and Luhansk has been jettisoned in favor of bombast and grandstanding.
即使最坚决的乌克兰民族主义者表达的态度，也要比现在美国的标准姿态务实的多。有关乌克兰的中立地位和国际监督下的顿涅茨克和卢甘斯克公投的想法已被抛在一边，取而代之的是浮夸而哗众取宠的言论。

The war was dangerous and destructive enough in its initial form. The combination of expanded strategic aims and scotched negotiations has made it more dangerous still. At present, the only message to Russia is: There is no way out. Nuclear weapons are discussed in easy tones, not least on Russian television. 
这场战争即使以它最初的形式看也是危险而毁灭性的。在战略目标扩大化和谈判受制的双重作用下，危险还会加剧。现在向俄罗斯传达的讯息只有一个：所有出路都已经封死。人们用平淡无奇的语调谈论着核武器，尤其是在俄罗斯的电视上。

Russia’s economic position has deteriorated. Far from a commodity superpower, its undersized domestic industry is struggling and is dependent on technology imports that are now inaccessible. What’s more, the invasion has led directly to greater military spending in second- and third-tier European powers. The number of NATO troops in Eastern Europe has grown tenfold, and a Nordic expansion of the organization is likely. 
俄罗斯的经济形势在恶化。它在日用品领域实力不强，规模有限的本土工业处境艰难，需要依靠一些如今已经无法获得的技术进口。此外，这场入侵也导致欧洲二三线国家增加军费开支。北约在东欧的驻军扩充了十倍，并且一些北欧国家可能会加入该组织。

Ukrainian casualties are not insignificant，A decisive military result in eastern Ukraine may prove elusive. Yet the less dramatic outcome of a festering stalemate is hardly better. Diplomatic efforts ought to be the centerpiece of a new Ukraine strategy. Instead, the Donbas is the frontier of freedom. This is not just declamatory extravagance. It is reckless. The risks hardly need to be stated.
乌克兰的损失不小，在东部的战事在军事上恐怕不会产生一个决定性的结果。然而这样一个惨厉的苦战僵局，就算以相对平淡的方式收尾，也谈不上是什么好事。一个新的乌克兰战略应该以外交努力为核心。然而，顿巴斯成了自由世界的边疆。这不只是夸夸其谈。这是在胡闹。由此带来的风险是显而易见的。

North Koreans are chronically malnourished and unvaccinated, there are barely any medicines left in the country, and the health infrastructure is incapable to deal with this pandemic, The international community should offer medicine for Covid-19 related symptoms, Covid-19 treating anti-viral medicines, and provide vaccines and all necessary infrastructure for vaccine preservation, including fridges, generators and gasoline.
长期以来，朝鲜民众营养不良，而且未接种疫苗，该国药品所剩无几，而且卫生基础建设不足以应对这场大流行，国际社会应该提供治疗新冠感染相关症状的药物，新冠抗病毒药物，并提供疫苗和一切保存疫苗所需的基础设施，包括冷柜、发电机和汽油。

Coinbase, the large cryptocurrency exchange, tanked in value. A cryptocurrency that promoted itself as a stable means of exchange collapsed. The crypto world went into a full meltdown this week in a sell-off that graphically illustrated the risks of the experimental and unregulated digital currencies. Critics said the collapse was long overdue, while some traders compared the alarm and fear to the start of the 2008 financial crisis.
大型加密货币交易所Coinbase市值暴跌。一种自称是稳定交易手段的加密货币崩溃了。加密货币世界在本周的抛售中彻底崩溃，这生动地说明了试验性和不受监管的数字货币存在的风险。批评人士表示，这次崩溃早该发生了，而一些交易员则将这种警报和担忧与2008年金融危机开始之时相提并论。

Big banks like Northern Trust and Bank of America also streamed in, along with hedge funds, some using debt to further juice their crypto bets. Those factors have compounded a so-called pandemic hangover that began as life started returning to normal in the United States
北方信托银行和美国银行等大银行以及对冲基金也纷纷涌入，一些对冲基金利用债务进一步充实自己的加密货币投资。这些因素加剧了随美国生活恢复正常而开始的所谓“疫情后遗症”

the average Bitcoin owner on Coinbase would not lose money until the digital currency’s price sank below $21,000. That, according to Mr. Dolev, is where a true death spiral could occur. Bitcoin was working as long as no one lost money, Once it gets back to those levels, that’s sort of the ‘Oh, my God’ moment. Professional investors who have weathered past crypto volatility also stayed calm. Some were even trying to capitalize on the drop.
Coinbase上的一般比特币持有者都不会亏损。多勒夫认为，只有到发展到那个地步，才有可能出现真正的死亡旋涡。只要没人赔钱，比特币就能运转，一旦它回到那个价位，那才是会喊出‘我的妈呀’的时候。过去经历过加密货币波动的专业投资者也保持了冷静。有些人甚至试图利用这次下跌赚钱。

A perfect replica requires imperfection. Take a grilled fish: Uniform all over, flawless in color and texture, it tells you nothing. But let’s say its silvery skin is marked with bubbles of assorted sizes, delicate crinkles and slightly uneven washes of carbonization. Let’s say the fish’s eyes are clouded over from the heat. And its markings, when you look closer, suggest it was flipped over the charcoal, showing you, under the gloss of its own rendered fat, a hot spot, where the heat on this nonexistent grill was more intense.
瑕疵使仿制品看上去更完美。拿烤鱼来说：整条鱼外观均匀，颜色和质地完美无瑕，它不像真的。但是假设它的银色鱼皮上有大小不一的泡泡、细微的皱褶和稍有些不均匀的碳化痕迹。假设鱼眼由于炙热而变得浑浊。当你仔细查看的时候，它身上的痕迹暗示着它在炭火上被翻了个面，在它泛着光泽的油脂下面，火力在那个不存在的烤架上变得更猛了。

The popular life-size food models known as shokuhin sampuru, displayed outside countless casual Japanese restaurants, function as promotional materials first, a way to boost sales. But the craftsmanship of a food model can be extraordinary — a fish so ridiculously crammed full of detail, so obsessively recreated, that you want the replica itself.
这种与实物一般大小的食物仿制品很受欢迎，它们被称为“食品样品”，无数普通日本餐厅都将其摆放在店外做展示，首先作为宣传材料，用于促进销售。但食物仿制品的工艺有时实在是非同一般——一条鱼身上的细节多得不可思议，重塑过程近乎偏执，以至于你想要这个仿制品本身。

media painted a picture of a city slowly returning to normal. One article described the “hustle and bustle of city life” returning, while another focused on statistics for how many stores had reopened.
媒的报道却描述这座城市在慢慢恢复正常。一篇文章说，“熙熙攘攘的城市生活”已在回归，而另一篇报道则强调了重新开业的商店数量。

Investors and business leaders worry that rigid adherence to its zero-Covid policy could send the economy into free fall. It is high time for the government to change its strategy.
投资者和商界领袖担心，严格坚持清零政策，可能会导致经济出现自由落体式的下滑。现在是政府改变政策的时候了

Police said that Gendron had traveled to Buffalo the day before the shooting and had done reconnaissance on Tops market. This is someone who had hate in their heart, soul and mind. The attack Saturday was the deadliest mass shooting in the United States this year, joining a roster of other racist massacres in recent years
警方表示，在枪击发生的前一天，金德伦曾前往布法罗，在托普斯超市踩点。这是一个内心、灵魂和思想里充满仇恨的人。周六的袭击是今年美国死亡人数最多的大规模枪击事件，近年来发生了一系列种族主义屠杀事件

Don’t tell me you’re a friend of our community and you don’t address this today at your pulpit, If you do not stand behind those holy desks and acknowledge that there are still people who hate Black people, you can go to hell with the shooter for all I care. 
如果今天你没有在你的讲坛上讨论这个问题，就不要告诉我你是我们社区的朋友，如果你不站在那些神圣的桌子后面，承认仍然有憎恨黑人的人，你可以和枪手一起下地狱，我不在乎。

Gendron described as “definitely a little bit of an outcast” and just wasn’t that social, resided in Conklin, New York, a suburban town with rolling hills in the southern part of Broome County, about 200 miles from Buffalo.
金德伦被形容为“确实有点像社会弃儿”, 确实不善于社交, 住在康克林, 布鲁姆县南部一个山丘连绵的郊区小镇，距离布法罗约200英里。

On Sunday, however, Gramaglia rebutted this suggestion, saying that his officers always worked to de-escalate violent situations. Gendron livestreamed his attack, police said, capturing the images of chaos he caused with a camera affixed to his helmet. 
不过，格拉马格利亚在周日反驳了这一说法，称他的警官一直致力于缓和暴力局势。警方说，金德伦对袭击过程进行了直播，用头盔上的摄像头拍下他制造的混乱场面。

Along with other Buffalo residents, Hochul stressed that she wanted the city to be known as a turning point in the nation’s string of gun tragedies. But she also expressed deep frustration with “the social media platforms that allow this hatred to ferment and spread like a virus.”
与其他布法罗居民一样，霍楚尔强调，她希望这座城市成为全国枪击案悲剧的转折点。但她也对“让这种仇恨像病毒一样发酵和传播的社交媒体平台”深表失望。

The two Scandinavian states have in effect made clear that they expect the threat from President Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia to be enduring, that they will not be cowed by it. Military nonalignment has served Sweden well, but our conclusion is that it won’t serve us equally well in the future, This is not a decision to be taken lightly.
这两个斯堪的纳维亚国家实际上是在表明，他们预计俄罗斯在普京总统领导下将持续构成威胁，而他们不会被其吓倒. 军事不结盟给瑞典带来了好处，但我们的结论是，它在未来不会对我们有同样的好处, 这不是一个轻易做出的决定。

This is a new Europe in which there is no more in-between space. Germany, a generally pacifist nation since it emerged from the rubble of 1945, has embarked on a massive investment in its armed forces, as well as an attempt to wean itself of dependence on energy from a Russia it had judged as, if not innocuous, at least a reliable business partner.
这是一个没有夹缝空间的新欧洲。自1945年的废墟中走出来的德国总体上是一个和平主义的国家，如今已开始大举投资其武装部队，并试图摆脱对俄罗斯能源的依赖，它曾认为俄罗斯即使不是完全无害，至少也是一个可靠的商业伙伴。

Sweden’s governing Social Democratic Party, the country’s largest party and long a bastion of nonalignment, has embraced NATO membership in an extraordinary turnabout. Putin climbed into a tree and does not know how to get down
瑞典执政的社会民主党是该国最大的政党，长期以来一直是不结盟的捍卫者，现在却接受了北约成员国身份，这是一个非同寻常的转变。普京骑虎难下

In practice, both Finland and Sweden have lived for a long time with Russian nuclear weapons in nearby Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic coast. But the security gains with NATO are incomparably higher than any added risk.
实际上，芬兰和瑞典长期以来都要忍受附近加里宁格勒的俄罗斯核武器的存在。加里宁格勒是夹在波罗的海沿岸波兰和立陶宛之间的一块俄罗斯飞地。但北约带来的安全收益远高于任何新增的风险。

Germany and France, were more intent on enjoying the peace dividend of the Cold War’s end than looking Mr. Putin’s ambitions in the eye. For a long time, even up to the eve of the Russian invasion, Europe has been divided. These illusions persisted even after Mr. Putin annexed Crimea. the thorny issue of Ukraine’s membership was left floating by Western leaders who did not want to provoke Mr. Putin further.
