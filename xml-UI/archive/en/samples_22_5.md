Russia needs every dollar of export revenue it can get right now. It is lurching toward default on its foreign debt. Much of Russia’s oil is very heavy, producing extra diesel when refined.
俄罗斯现在需要它能获得的每一美元出口收入。俄罗斯的外债正一步步走向违约。俄罗斯的大部分石油都很重，精炼后会产生更多柴油

All of that construction will require huge fleets of diesel-guzzling trucks, excavators, pile drivers, bulldozers and other equipment.
所有这些建设都将需要庞大的柴油车队、挖掘机、打桩机、推土机和其他设备。

By 2020, the Baluch insurgency had been greatly weakened by years of counterinsurgency operations, rifts among separatist groups, fatigue and government incentives for the militants to lay down their weapons.
到2020年，由于多年的平叛行动、分离主义团体之间的分歧、反叛势力的疲态，以及政府对武装分子放下武器的激励措施，俾路支的叛乱活动已被大幅削弱

But as the pandemic and the war in Ukraine continue to weigh on trade and business ties, that period of plenty appears to be undergoing a partial reversal. If it lasts, such a shift away from fine-tuned globalization could have important implications for inflation and the world’s economy.
但随着疫情和乌克兰战争持续影响贸易和商业关系，这种繁荣时期似乎正在发生部分逆转。如果这种情况持续下去，意味着从经过精心优化的全球化脱离出来，这样的趋势会对通胀和世界经济产生重要影响

Computers and other technology made factories more efficient, and they chugged out sneakers, kitchen tables and electronics at a pace unmatched in history. Companies slashed their production cost by moving factories offshore, where wages were lower. The pandemic also exposed the snowball effect of highly optimized supply chains
电脑和其他技术提高了工厂的效率，它们以史上无与伦比的速度生产运动鞋、厨房桌和电子产品。企业将工厂转移到工资更低的海外，从而削减生产成本, 这场疫情还暴露出高度优化的供应链的滚雪球效应

Many economists expect price increases for durable goods to cool substantially in the months ahead, which should help calm overall price gains. 
许多经济学家预计，未来几个月耐用品价格涨幅将大幅降温，这应该有助于平抑整体价格涨幅。

Customers are now future-proofing their supply chains, Some reshoring is occurring — let’s make no mistake about that
客户“现在正在为他们的供应链寻找抵抗未来风险的保障”。一些产业正在回流，这一点是毋庸置疑的。

Countless facts tell us that we can win respect and initiative only if we show the spirit of brave fighters defeating our foes face to face on a narrow path, daring to struggle, mastering struggle. Persist with dynamic zero, protecting people’s lives and health to the maximum extent, while reducing the impact of the pandemic on economic and social development to a minimum
无数事实告诉我们，唯有以狭路相逢勇者胜的气概，敢于斗争、善于斗争，我们才能赢得尊严、赢得主动. 坚持动态清零，最大程度保护人民生命安全和身体健康，最大限度减少疫情对经济社会发展的影响

The draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade that leaked Monday night is not yet final. But when the dust settles, American women may conclude that they had lost the right to abortion the same way that an Ernest Hemingway character said he had gone bankrupt: gradually, and then suddenly.
周一晚间泄露的最高法院推翻罗诉韦德案的意见书草案并非最终版本。但待尘埃落定时，美国的女性可能会得出结论，她们已经失去了堕胎的权利，就像海明威笔下的一个人物形容他的破产一样：先是逐渐地，然后突然就身无分文了

Now, as the rest of the world has dropped border controls and restarted business, that distinction has largely evaporated, and Taiwan risks losing out on tourism and investment by continuing to stay closed.
现在，随着世界其他地区取消边境管制，重启商业活动，这种差异基本消失，而台湾如果继续封闭，可能给旅游业和投资造成损失

Taiwan was still hoarding toilet paper and maintaining armies of workers in head-to-toe protective suits while the rest of the world was seemingly moving on? It makes me very sad and pissed about where I am, seeing people elsewhere living a normal life.
台湾为何还在囤积卫生纸，还让大批工作者从头到脚穿着防护服. 看到别处的人过着正常的生活，这让我对自己的处境非常难过，也非常气愤

His rise to the top leadership position is “a concentrated embodiment of public opinion,” But he will also face a city embattled by the coronavirus and some of the world’s toughest pandemic restrictions.
他当选行政长官“是民意的集中体现”，但他将面对的也是一个受新冠病毒大流行和世界上一些最严格的限制措施所困扰的城市。

Iran has completely stacked the election committee with its loyalists and further twisted the process into a meaningless competition
伊朗让选举委员会全是听自己话的人，进一步将这个过程扭曲为一次毫无意义的竞选

The lines begin forming before lunchtime and wind on well into the night, with customers outside craning their necks for views of the day’s selection through the window. It is not a newly anointed Michelin bistro or the latest photogenic, Instagram-friendly confection that has captivated Hong Kong, a famously epicurean city. It is a humble takeout box of white rice and two precooked main dishes of the diner’s choosing. The price: around $4.
午餐时间开始前，队伍就排起来了，一直持续到深夜。餐厅外面的顾客伸着脖子透过窗户查看当天的菜品。这不是刚刚得到米其林垂青的餐馆，也不是最新一道俘获美食城市香港的网红甜点。这是一个简朴的外卖盒，白米饭配用餐者自选的两道预先做好的菜。价格约4美元左右

Until now, she has had comparatively little to say about Ukraine, but her full-throated call for an end to the war on Sunday was a departure that reflected the bolder and broader steps the Biden administration has taken to move against Russian aggression without engaging Moscow in an all-out war.
到目前为止，她在乌克兰问题上的发言相对较少，但她在周日全力呼吁结束战争是一个起点，表明拜登政府在不与莫斯科全面开战的情况下，为打击俄罗斯侵略所采取的更大胆、更广泛的措施

Dr. Biden’s work was in the tradition of other first ladies who had traveled oversees to witness the “personification of pain,” hearing stories of trauma and war, all while staying within the limits of an unelected role within the administration. There’s real finesse to this, Because you’ve got to carry all of those memories with you. It’s hard work.
拜登博士的工作沿袭了其他第一夫人的传统，她们前往海外见证“苦难的化身”，聆听创伤和战争的故事，同时保持一个政府内部的非民选角色。这是需要真正的技巧的，因为那些记忆将伴你一生。这是一项艰难的工作
