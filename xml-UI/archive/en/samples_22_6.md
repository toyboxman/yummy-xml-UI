The writing had been on the wall. Only China has “both the intent to reshape the international order” and the power to do so
征兆早已出现。中国“是唯一不仅具有重塑国际秩序的意图”，也有能力这样做的国家

But it has been willing to engage diplomatically, has repeatedly championed the inviolability of state borders and is not averse to self-interested compromise over issues like trade and climate change. 
但它一直愿意进行外交上的接触，反复强调国家主权不可侵犯，并不反对在贸易和气候变化等问题上做出符合自身利益的妥协。

It’s rhetoric over Taiwan has been little more than saber-rattling and appears restrained compared to how the United States has historically treated t Latin America. Advocates of a new Cold War with China will surely roll their eyes at these assertions. 
中国在台湾问题上的言辞一直都没太超出武力恫吓的范围，与美国在历史上对待拉丁美洲的做法相比显得还要克制. 提倡与中国进入新冷战关系的人肯定会对上述主张翻白眼。

It’s rarely wise to take on two adversaries at once. Mr. Biden should find new ways to work with China, rather than trying to coerce it to be different. He should take bold steps to tone down the rhetoric
同时与两个对手较量很少是明智之举。拜登应该找到与中国打交道的新方式，而不是试图迫使它改变自己。他应该在缓和言辞上采取大胆的步骤

Packets of hemostatic granules, she found out, can stop catastrophic bleeding; decompression needles can relieve pressure in a punctured chest. Ms. Abiyeva, 37, has decided to take matters into her own hands.
她发现，一包包止血颗粒可以阻止大出血；减压针可以为受穿刺伤的胸部缓解压力。37岁的阿比耶娃决定自己动手解决问题。

One woman describes her son using a wire to reattach soles to his boots. But on the ground, the concerns are more prosaic. With the approach of summer, Lyme disease-bearing ticks are out, the group put out an urgent call for backpacks, along with shoes, Q-tips, socks, headlamps, lighters, hats, sugar and batteries.
一名女性描述了她的儿子用一根电线将鞋底重新固定在靴子上。但在战场上，人们担忧的是一些更普通的东西。会传播莱姆病的蜱虫随着夏季的临近开始出没, 她们发出紧急呼吁提供背包、鞋子、棉签、袜子、头灯、打火机、帽子、糖和电池。

he felt “shocked, disbelieving, sad, and angry” about the math book illustrations. It is impossible to overstate their importance. He called not just for corrections and apologies, but also for an investigation and for those responsible to be held accountable.
他对数学书中的插图感到“震惊、难以置信、痛心、愤怒”。其重要性怎么说都不为过！ 他呼吁不仅要整改、道歉，还必须深挖和追责。

We have organized experts to study them carefully, and humbly adopt good opinions and suggestions from all walks of life, We have carried out serious reflection, and feel deep self-blame and guilt, and hereby express our deepest apologies
我们已“组织专家认真研究，对社会各界好的意见建议虚心采纳”，我们进行了认真反思，深感自责和内疚

He said he welcomed Chinese exchange students, and that many of them stay — “They help drive innovation here at home, and that benefits all of us.”
他说，他欢迎中国留学生，他们当中的许多人会留下来——“他们有助于推动国内的创新，这对我们大家都有利。”

Beijing is fully entrenched, its power irrepressible if not always embraced. And that has left the United States playing catch-up in a vital strategic arena.
中国已在这里完全站稳了脚跟，它的力量虽然并非总是受到欢迎，但也已经不可抑制。这使得美国在与中国的全球竞争中，要在一个愈发关键的舞台上奋起直追。

At some of those old installations, there are memorial plaques in hidden corners, but the infrastructure has mostly been left to decay. 
在其中一些老旧的设施中，有时还能在不为人知的角落里找到一些纪念牌匾，但这种基础设施大多已经荒废。

We need to be moved by the pain of all of the suffering. But it is important that we are not paralyzed by it, It makes us value life because we understand life is very precious, life is very brief, it can be extinguished in a single instant.
我们需要被所有这些苦难的痛苦触动。但重要的是，我们不要被它吓倒，它让我们珍惜生命，因为我们明白生命很宝贵，生命很短暂，可以在一瞬间熄灭。

American culture often prizes individual liberty above collective needs. But ultimately humans are born to care about others and to not turn away
美国文化常常把个人自由置于集体需求之上。但归根结底，人类生来就是要关心他人，而不是回避他人

They strolled and cycled through their own city like dazed tourists. They hopped onto ferries once again, crossing the Huangpu River, and crowded onto the famed Bund waterfront. They honked car horns and lit fireworks. Everyone had these problems at the time and felt a bit confounded about what to do,
他们像茫然的游客那样在自己的城市闲逛、骑车。他们再次登上渡船，越过黄浦江，聚集在著名的外滩。他们按着汽车喇叭，点燃烟花。当时大家都有这种问题，都有一点儿茫然不知

Wagner meddles in politics, props up autocrats and orchestrates digital propaganda campaigns. It donates food to the poor and produces action movies set in Africa. It has even organized a beauty pageant.
瓦格纳插手政治，支持独裁者，策划网上的政治宣传。它向穷人捐助食物，并制作以非洲为背景的动作电影。它甚至还组织了一次选美大赛。

Some African leaders are drawn to Moscow by weapons: Russia has become the largest arms supplier in Africa. But Mr. Putin is also tapping into deep historical and political currents.
一些非洲领导人被莫斯科的武器所吸引：俄罗斯已成为非洲最大的武器供应国。但普京也在利用深刻的历史和政治潮流。

The old nuclear order, rooted in the Cold War’s unthinkable outcomes, was fraying before Russia invaded Ukraine. Now, it is giving way to a looming era of disorder unlike any since the beginning of the atomic age.
在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰之前，旧的核秩序——源自冷战不可想象的后果——就已经开始瓦解。现在，正在取代它的是一个即将到来的混乱时代，这是自原子时代以来从未有过的。

Other administration officials are more skeptical, noting that Russia’s saber rattling failed to deter the West from arming Ukraine — and that the lesson China may take away is that nuclear threats can backfire.
其他政府官员则持怀疑态度，指出俄罗斯的武力威胁未能阻止西方武装乌克兰——中国可能得到的经验是核威胁可能适得其反。

A lack of buy-in could undermine the United States’ ability to set the rules on emerging issues like the digital economy, which would give American firms a leg up. But it does not include better access to the huge U.S. import market, a crucial carrot that normally underpins trade agreements.
缺乏共识可能会削弱美国在数字经济等新兴问题上制定规则的能力，这些规则本可让美国公司获得优势。但它不包括扩大美国巨大进口市场的准入，而这通常是支撑贸易协定的一根关键的胡萝卜。

Europe’s countries, under the shortsighted leadership of the United States, were “sleepwalking” into war with Russia. Mr. Guaino was borrowing a metaphor that the historian Christopher Clark used to describe the origins of World War I.
在目光短浅的美国带领下，欧洲国家正在“梦游”般走入与俄罗斯的战争。盖伊诺的这一比喻借用了历史学家克里斯托弗·克拉克对“一战”起源的描述。

On Nov. 10, 2021, the United States and Ukraine signed a “charter on strategic partnership” that called for Ukraine to join NATO, condemned “ongoing Russian aggression” and affirmed an “unwavering commitment” to the reintegration of Crimea into Ukraine.
2021年11月10日，美国与乌克兰签署了“战略合作伙伴宪章”，呼吁让乌克兰加入北约，谴责了“俄罗斯仍在进行的侵犯”，并重申了对克里米亚重新归属乌克兰的“坚定承诺”。

To make concessions to Russia would be submitting to aggression, To make none would be submitting to insanity. The United States is making no concessions. That would be to lose face. There’s an election coming. So the administration is closing off avenues of negotiation and working to intensify the war. 
对俄罗斯做出让步就是屈服于侵略，对一切都不让步将是屈服于疯狂。美国没有做出任何让步。那样做会颜面尽失。毕竟快要选举了。因此，政府正在关闭谈判通道并努力加剧战争。我们是奔着赢下战争去的。

The decision is the latest turn in a long game of whack-a-mole that the U.S. government has played against low-priced imports in the solar industry.
美国政府一直在对太阳能行业低价进口产品采取“打地鼠”行动，而该决定是其最新转折。

The domestic producers have accused importers — who have close commercial ties with China — of exaggerating their industry’s hardships to try to sway the Biden administration and preserve profit margins that stem from unfairly priced imports.
国内生产商指责与中国有密切商业联系的进口商夸大行业困难，试图影响拜登政府，维护因不公平的进口定价而产生的利润空间。

The dispute, over tariffs on China, was tame by Washington standards: No bureaucratic knife fights, no disparaging quotes given to newspapers on background. For Mr. Biden and the top members of his foreign policy staff, familiarity has bred cohesion. But harmony has a dark side: groupthink.
以华盛顿的标准来看，这场围绕对华关税的争端是温和的。没有官僚主义的刀光剑影，没有向报纸提供贬低性引言作为背景。对于拜登及其外交政策幕僚中的高层成员来说，彼此之间的熟悉带来了凝聚力。但是一片和谐也有黑暗面：群体思维。

The Blob tends to see American foreign policy as a series of military challenges, which require military solutions. Most of Mr. Biden’s top aides hail from institutions that incline them toward that point of view. 
“小集团”倾向于将美国的外交政策视为一系列军事挑战，这些挑战需要军事解决方案。拜登的大部分高级助手都来自于那些令他们倾向于这一观点的机构。

The U.S. side hopes that climate cooperation can be an ‘oasis’ in China-U.S. relations, but if that ‘oasis’ is surrounded by desert, it will also become desertified sooner or later.
美方希望气变合作成为中美关系的‘绿洲’，但如果‘绿洲’周围被都是‘荒漠’，‘绿洲’迟早会被沙化。

Yet even as schools and offices are opening in waves and public transportation is being restored, other measures remained in place to prevent the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the virus. The risk of epidemic rebound still exists, We cannot relax yet, but must be highly vigilant.
然而，即使学校和办公室陆续开放，公共交通正在恢复，其他措施仍在实施，以防止具有高度传播性的奥密克戎变种。疫情反弹风险依然存在，依然不能放松，需要高度警惕。

For all the backlash that “Lean In” eventually sparked, there were millions of women who saw some of their own potential in Ms. Sandberg’s megawatt success. And Ms. Sandberg faced even greater scrutiny as public perception of her company dimmed.
尽管《向前一步》最终引发了这么多强烈反对，但仍有数百万女性在桑德伯格的巨大成功中看到了自己的一些潜力。随着公众对她的公司越来越失望，桑德伯格面临着更严格的审视。

Scientists don’t know exactly what makes coffee so beneficial, but the answer may lie in its antioxidant properties, which can prevent or delay cell damage. Coffee beans contain high amounts of antioxidants which can help break down free radicals that cause damage to cells. 
科学家并不知道具体是什么使咖啡如此有益，但答案可能在于其能够防止或延迟细胞损伤的抗氧化性质。咖啡豆含有大量抗氧化物质，可以帮助分解导致细胞损伤的自由基。

Over time, a buildup of free radicals can increase inflammation in the body, which can cause plaque formation related to heart disease, so dietitians recommend consuming foods and beverages that are rich in antioxidants.
随着时间的推移，自由基的积累会增加体内的炎症，从而导致与心脏病相关的斑块形成，因此营养师建议食用富含抗氧化剂的食物和饮料。

If you’re pounding Mountain Dew or Coca-Cola or Red Bull or all these other drinks, they have tons more sugar, all the artificial stuff — versus coffee, which is a generally unprocessed food.
如果你正在给自己灌激浪、可口可乐、红牛或其他类似饮料，它们含有更多的糖，还有那些人造的东西——而咖啡是一种通常未经加工的食物。

Despite the encouraging evidence about coffee, there isn’t enough data to suggest that people who don’t currently drink coffee should add a stop to Starbucks during their morning routines. And even avid coffee drinkers shouldn’t use the study to justify endless cups of java. Moderation is good, But too much of a good thing isn’t necessarily more of a good thing.
尽管关于咖啡的证据令人鼓舞，但没有足够的数据表明，目前不喝咖啡的人应该在早上去一趟星巴克。即使是狂热的咖啡爱好者也不应该用这项研究来证明没完没了喝咖啡的合理性。适量是好事，但是好的东西摄入太多未必会更好。

I’m pretty sure the jubilee atmosphere is a four-day wonder, and that the national mood will turn fairly sour again fairly quickly, It feels like we’re all waiting for something to happen, For the storm or the dam to break. But it’s hard to predict if it will.
我敢肯定，登基70周年纪念的气氛是一个持续四天的奇迹，国民情绪将很快再次变得相当糟糕，感觉我们都在等待什么事情发生，等待暴风雨或者堤坝决堤。但很难预测这是否会发生。

At the concert the night before, Elizabeth stole the show with a prerecorded sequence in which she shared a mishap-prone cream tea with Paddington Bear, voiced by the actor Ben Whishaw.
在前一天晚上的音乐会上，伊丽莎白以预先录制的视频抢尽风头，在该片段中，她与演员本·威士肖配音的帕丁顿熊共享了一次意外频出的下午茶。

The sequence was reminiscent of the 2012 Olympic Games, which featured an even more elaborate sketch of the queen and James Bond, played by Daniel Craig, parachuting into the stadium from a helicopter during the opening ceremony.
这个场景让人想起2012年奥运会的一幕，女王在开幕式上以短片形式展现了更加细致的表演——“女王”和丹尼尔·克雷格饰演的詹姆斯·邦德从直升机上跳伞进入体育场。

The Johnny Depp-Amber Heard defamation trial was, from gavel to gavel, a singularly baffling, unedifying and sad spectacle.
从头到尾，约翰尼·德普-安珀·赫德诽谤案的审判场面都堪称莫名其妙、不堪入目且极其可悲。

Though he remains prime minister, he may be living on borrowed time. It is one of the most head-spinning reversals of fortune in modern British political history.
尽管他仍是首相，但他可能只是在苟延残喘。这是英国现代政治史上最令人晕眩的命运扭转之一。

To some extent, Mr. Johnson’s standing crumbled because of the same baffling mix of strengths and foibles that propelled his rise: rare political intuition offset by breathtaking personal recklessness
在某种程度上，约翰逊声望崩溃的原因，与将他推上政坛之巅的那种毅力与怪癖令人困惑的结合相同：罕见的政治直觉被惊人的个人鲁莽抵消

Johnson’s such an accomplished escape artist, and his colleagues so craven and cowardly that you can’t rule out him living to fight another day
约翰逊是一名技能如此高超的脱身术大师，而他的同事们又是那么怯懦和胆小，并不能排除他卷土重来的可能性

Activists are adopting symbols and language that are off-putting not just to the right but to people in the center and even liberals, You don’t become a candidate for the presidency or speaker of the House by being dumb about what works in politics
活动人士在引入的符号和语言不仅惹恼了右派，也惹恼了中间派甚至自由派，要是搞不清政治上什么行得通，什么行不通，你是不可能成为一名总统候选人或众议院议长的

The disaster had been born of greed and negligence. The owner of the Sewol had added extra berths, making the ferry top-heavy. Cellphones salvaged from the wreckage showed videos of children frantically saying goodbye to their parents as the cold waves filled their cabins.
导致这场灾难的原因是贪婪和疏忽。“世越号”的船主在船上增加了额外的舱位，导致船身上部过重。从沉船中打捞出来的手机上的视频显示，当寒冷的海水涌入船舱时，孩子们发狂似地向父母告别。

Apple and Google often accompany these software updates with highfalutin language and promises. But in reality, lots of the changes — especially the ability to retroactively edit a text — are incremental improvements that feel as if they should have happened a long time ago.
苹果和谷歌在进行这些软件更新时，往往会伴随着冠冕堂皇的说法和承诺。但实际上，很多变化——尤其是对编辑已发出短信的能力——都是渐进式的改进，感觉它们似乎早就该发生了

The saber rattling is nothing new. North Korea’s weapons program has vexed four of President Biden’s predecessors, each of whom wielded combinations of various incentives and sanctions, ultimately failing to halt the production of nuclear warheads and missiles.
炫耀武力并不是什么新鲜事。朝鲜的武器计划一直是令拜登总统的四位前任烦恼的问题，他们每个人都用过各种胡萝卜加大棒的做法，但始终未能阻止朝鲜制造核弹头和导弹。

Hand-drawn posters that lined the walls of her rural clinic suggested eating two bulbs of raw garlic, drinking liquor fortified with an egg and sliced ginseng or sipping tepid water with sliced spring onions and sugar to ward off colds and the flu.
她的农村诊所的墙上挂着手绘的图片，建议人们吃两粒生大蒜，喝加了鸡蛋和人参片的白酒，或者喝加了小葱片和糖的温水来预防感冒和流感。

wars can change the course of history and great battles often decide wars. Great battles, won or lost, change the entire course of events, create new standards of values, new moods, new atmospheres, in armies and in nations, to which all must conform.
战争可以改变历史的进程，而伟大的战斗往往决定战争的结局。伟大的战斗，无论输赢，改变了整个事件的进程，在军队和在国家中创造了新的价值标准，新的氛围，新的环境，所有人只能服从。

The 19th century’s naval wars accelerated a shift from wind- to coal-powered vessels. World War I brought about a shift from coal to oil. World War II introduced nuclear energy as a major power source. In each of these cases, wartime innovations flowed directly to the civilian economy and ushered in a new era. Go figure: If this war doesn’t inadvertently blow up the planet, it might inadvertently help sustain it. 
19世纪的海战加速了船只从风力驱动向燃煤驱动的转变。第一次世界大战使人们从用煤转向用石油。第二次世界大战使核能成为重要能源。在这些案例中，战时的创新都直接流向了民用经济，开创了一个新时代。想想看：如果这场战争没有在不经意间摧毁地球，它可能会在不经意间帮助地球维持下去。

Their approach, the equivalent of an ostrich sticking its head in the sand, doesn’t make sense to a tech entrepreneur and a venture capitalist, has questioned how his peers can pretend it’s business as usual, given the political and economic upheaval. 
这就等于是把头埋进沙子里的鸵鸟。这位科技企业家和风险投资家质疑，在这样的政治和经济动荡之下，他的同行们为什么可以假装一切如常。

It’s a fair point to make, and it’s something we certainly should consider moving forward. That’s why we have to be really careful how to frame this.
这个问题有一定道理，我们今后当然应该考虑这一点。这就是为什么我们必须非常小心地表述这个问题。

Most people think that smallpox usually is transmitted by large droplets, but it can, for whatever reason, occasionally be transmitted by small-particle aerosols. There is evidence that a pregnant woman can pass the monkeypox virus on to her fetus.
大多数人认为天花通常是通过较大飞沫传播的，但它偶尔会——无论出于何种原因——通过小颗粒气溶胶传播。有证据表明，孕妇会将猴痘病毒传染给胎儿。

In the West, Russians were no longer viewed as liberated hostages of a totalitarian regime, reformed villains from James Bond movies or emissaries of the great culture of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, but rather as all-cash buyers of luxurious properties in Manhattan and Miami. 
在西方，俄罗斯人不再被视为从极权主义政权解放出来的人质、007电影中痛改前非的反派或托尔斯泰和陀思妥耶夫斯基伟大文化的使者，而是被视为曼哈顿和迈阿密豪宅的全款买家。

The through-line of that narrative runs roughly from Mr. Trump’s declaration in August 2020. Yes, there are gaping holes that remain to be filled in on the events of the day itself. If the evidence warrants it, the committee should not shy away from transmitting criminal referrals. 
这一叙事的主线大致始于特朗普在2020年8月败选宣布。关于当天发生的事件本身，还有很多空白需要填补。 如果有证据支持，该委员会不应回避移交刑事案件

Google said that its systems imitated conversational exchanges and could riff on different topics, but did not have consciousness. Google’s technology is what scientists call a neural network, which is a mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing large amounts of data. 
谷歌表示，公司的AI系统模仿人们的对话交流，能对不同的话题进行复述，但没有意识。谷歌的这项技术被科学家称为神经网络，是一个通过分析大量数据来学习技能的数学模型。

But they are extremely flawed. Sometimes they generate perfect prose. Sometimes they generate nonsense. The systems are very good at recreating patterns they have seen in the past, but they cannot reason like a human.
但它们也存在巨大的缺陷。它们有时能写出完美的散文，有时却生成毫无意义的话。这些系统非常擅长将它们以前遇到过的模式再现出来，但不能像人类那样思考。

In the United States, Taiwanese Presbyterian churches have become a social hub for older congregants to bond over their common language and shared experiences. At church bazaars, grandmothers and aunties cook beloved Taiwanese snacks, including sticky rice wrapped in bamboo leaves, and oyster pancakes.
在美国，台湾长老会教会成了年长会众的社交中心，他们通过共同的语言和经历联系起来。在教堂的集市上，阿妈和阿姨们会烹制深受喜爱的台湾小吃，包括粽子和蚵仔煎。

He starts out with an elegance of mind and sweetness of temperament, reading Goethe’s “The Sorrows of Young Werther” and gathering firewood for a poor family.
他阅读歌德的《少年维特的烦恼》(The Sorrows of Young Werther)，为一个贫困家庭拾柴火，本是个有着优雅的心灵与和蔼可亲的气质的人物。

 If his onetime lap dog Mike Pence was strung up on the gallows outside the Capitol for refusing to help Trump hold onto his office illegitimately, Trump said, so be it. 
 特朗普说，如果迈克·彭斯——他曾经的哈巴狗——因为拒绝帮助特朗普非法保住总统职位而被吊死在国会山外的绞刑架上，那也没什么不行的。

 It’s mind-boggling that so many people still embrace Trump when it’s so plain that he cares only about himself. He was quick to throw Ivanka off the sled on Friday, indicating her opinion did not count since she “was not involved in looking at, or studying, Election results. She had long since checked out.”
 匪夷所思的是，特朗普只关心自己，却有这么多人仍然拥护他。周五，他很快就抛弃了伊万卡，表示她的意见不算数，因为她“没有参与查看或研究选举结果。她早就退出了。”
 
 What he found was not boot camp but summer camp. When he and his fellow conscripts jogged, the pace was set by the slowest man, who tired after 100 yards. They spent hours clearing weeds and sweeping. Combat training has also been widely criticized as perfunctory
 他发现自己来到的不是新兵训练营，而是夏令营。当他和其他应征者慢跑时，由跑得最慢的人决定速度，那人跑一百公尺后就累了。他们花了几个小时除草和扫地。战斗训练也被广泛批评为敷衍了事

 Rudy Giuliani seemed drunk, and he was making a beeline for the president. It was election night in 2020, and President Donald Trump was seeing his reelection bid slip away, vote by vote. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and personal lawyer for Trump, was spouting conspiracy theories.
 鲁迪·朱利安尼似乎喝醉了，他径直朝总统走去。那是2020年的大选之夜，特朗普总统眼睁睁地看着他的连任竞选正在一票接一票地溜走。前纽约市市长、特朗普的私人律师朱利安尼当时正在大谈阴谋论。

 Many noted that the women had fulfilled all the usual tips about how to avoid harassment — they had gone out in a group and were in a well-lit public space — and were still unsafe. The attackers were charged with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” and intentional assault.
 许多人指出，被打女性采取的都是人们经常建议的如何避免骚扰的做法，她们结伴外出，去的是灯光明亮的公共场所，但她们仍然不安全。法律上对施暴者的指控是“寻衅滋事”和故意伤害。

There are so many incidents that were not filmed, Violence against women, no matter what kind, in our society is really nothing new.
有好多案子没有录下来，对妇女的暴力，不管是哪一种形式的暴力，实际上在我们的社会生活当中已经屡见不鲜

Retailers “will do as much as they can to demonstrate dramatic changes in pricing where possible,” but they still face pent-up pressures in the supply chain in terms of cost. The tariffs amounted to “pennies on the dollar” for Chinese goods that were already priced far below alternatives from other countries.
零售商“尽其所能让人们看到价格的巨大变化”，但在成本方面，他们仍然面临着积累已久的供应链压力。中国商品的关税根本是“九牛一毛”，这些商品的标价已经远远低于其他国家的同类商品。

Husarivka was a speed bump in a Russian advance that failed, and we were there doing the same thing as Husarivka’s residents: taking stock of the wreckage and the loss.
在俄军的这场失败的攻击行动中，古萨里夫卡村只能算是一条减速带，我们在那里做着和古萨里夫卡居民一样的事情：清点残骸和损失。

In Bangladesh, floods that came before the monsoons stranded millions of people, complicating longstanding efforts to improve the country’s response to chronic flooding. In Nepal, officials are trying to drain about-to-burst glacial lakes before they wash away Himalayan villages facing a new phenomenon: too much rain, too little drinking water.
在孟加拉国，雨季之前发生的洪水使数百万人陷入困境，给该国治理水患痼疾的长期努力增加了困难。在尼泊尔，官员们正试图排干冰川湖，因为一旦破裂，湖水会冲毁喜马拉雅地区的村庄，这些村庄面临一个新的现象：雨水过多，饮用水过少。

Heavy rains came earlier and lasted longer than usual, inundating the fields. When the unseasonably heavy rains flooded the fields, and then the equally unseasonable heat shriveled the seeds, it didn’t just slash Ranjit Singh’s wheat harvest by nearly half.
暴雨比往年来得更早，持续时间也更长，淹没了农田。反常的大雨淹没了农田，接着，同样反常的高温使种子枯萎，对兰吉特·辛格来说，损失的并不只是将近一半的小麦歉收。

India was “extremely vulnerable” to food security threats not just because of drops in production, but also because much of the population could struggle to afford food as prices rise.
印度“极其容易”受到粮食安全威胁的影响，这不仅是因为产量下降，还因为随着粮价上涨，很多人可能负担不起食品价格。

On top of the fires came pestilence. Panic gripped the mountain town of Pir Koh after a large number of people — most of them children — experienced diarrhea, vomiting and leg cramps.
大火之外还暴发了瘟疫。在大量民众——其中大多数是儿童——出现腹泻、呕吐和腿部抽筋的状况后，山城皮尔科陷入了恐慌。

 Scores of manufacturers have rolled out such systems in recent years, including features that let you take your hands off the steering wheel under certain conditions and that help you parallel park.
 近年来，数十家制造商推出了这类系统，包括在某些情况下让手离开方向盘的功能，以及帮助你侧方停车的功能。

Unlike its two earlier carriers that feature a “ski jump” deck, the Fujian has an electromagnetic catapult system, previously a feature that only the U.S. Navy had
福建舰与之前的两艘滑跃式甲板航母不同，它配置了电磁弹射系统，这种技术曾是美国海军所独有

A year ago, business was humming for Liang Jiawei, a property salesman in Zhanjiang, He could sell three apartments in a day without much arm-twisting. The apartments were fairly generic
一年前，中国南方沿海城市湛江的房地产销售梁嘉伟的生意还不错。他一天轻轻松松就能卖掉三套公寓。这些公寓相当普通

Less bombastic in his exhortations, President Joe Biden nevertheless also evokes the specter of China to urge a retreat from the failed policies of past administrations.
拜登总统敦促从过去政府的失败政策中撤退，虽然他的劝告没有那么夸张，但仍然引发了人们对中国的担忧

People are making tough choices in terms of what do they cut back on, and for lower income families there’s not a lot of wiggle room there.
人们正在艰难地选择削减哪方面的支出，而对于低收入家庭来说没有太多的回旋余地。

Denied federal support ever since, the SETI endeavor has limped along, supported by donations to a nonprofit organization, the SETI Institute, in Mountain View
自那以后，由于得不到联邦政府的支持，SETI计划一直举步维艰，其资金来自于加州山景城的非营利组织SETI研究所。

All of the patients who developed a more serious illness were over 60 years old and had underlying medical conditions, according to the study
所有出现重症的患者均超过60岁，并且有基础性疾病。

But it remains to be seen if the U.S. government is willing or able to turn away such an array of foreign goods. China is so central to so many supply chains
但美国政府是否愿意或能够拒绝如此多的外国商品，还有待观察。中国对如此多的供应链至关重要

Generations of Hong Kongers celebrated weddings and cut business deals there over Cantonese fare like crispy pork belly and wok-baked mud crab. 
几代香港人在这里办婚宴、洽谈生意时，都要吃脆皮烧肉和避风塘炒蟹等粤菜

Even as giant residential towers sprang up around Jumbo, its garish neon sign and imperial-style architecture still dominated the skyline around Aberdeen Harbor, on the southwest side of Hong Kong Island. 
尽管珍宝海鲜舫的周围已盖起了高大的住宅楼，但这家餐厅耀眼的霓虹灯招牌和宫殿风格的建筑仍让其在香港岛西南的香港仔湾的天际线中具有显眼地位

Did Biden drop the ball on TikTok and China? Earlier this year, TikTok was working on a deal to store its data on Oracle servers to please regulators. Trump used its results to issue an executive order forcing ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese parent, to divest the company.
拜登在TikTok和中国的问题上是否犯了错误？今年早些时候，TikTok正在努力达成一项协议，将数据存储在甲骨文的服务器上，以取悦监管机构。特朗普利用调查结果发布了一项行政命令，迫使TikTok的中国母公司字节跳动剥离该公司。

This is not like a ‘picking needles out of a haystack’ problem, This is touching a meaningful percentage of all of the world’s everyday goods.
这不是‘大海捞针’的问题，这涉及全球所有日常商品中相当大的一部分。

Xinjiang produces more than 40 percent of the world’s polysilicon, a quarter of the world’s tomato paste and a fifth of global cotton. It’s also responsible for 15 percent of the world’s hops and about a tenth of global walnuts, peppers and rayon. 
新疆生产的多晶硅占全球总产量的40%以上，番茄酱占全球总产量的四分之一，棉花占全球总产量的五分之一，还有世界上15%的啤酒花和约十分之一的核桃、辣椒和人造纤维。
