The unilateral sanctions and so-called ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ imposed by the U.S. on other countries in accordance with its domestic laws are against international law and basic norms governing international relations
美方依据国内法对其他国家实施单边制裁和所谓‘长臂管辖’，违反国际法和国际关系基本准则

By one economic theory, the choice of whether to obey the law is like any other decision, a weighing of costs and benefits. But you know from personal experience that’s not true. There are plenty of times you could have lied, cheated or stolen with impunity. You did the right thing anyway because you more or less accepted the legitimacy of the laws, how they were enacted and how the people who enacted them were selected.
根据一种经济学理论，是否遵守法律的选择就像任何其他决定一样，是对成本和收益的权衡。但是通过个人经历，你就知道事实并非如此。很多时候，你可以撒谎、欺骗或偷窃而不受惩罚。但你还是做了正确的事，因为你或多或少接受了法律的正当性，接受了法律是如何制定，以及制定法律的人是如何被选出的

The majority does not save judges from unwieldy tests or extricate them from the sphere of controversy, To the contrary, it discards a known, workable and predictable standard in favor of something novel and probably far more complicated.
多数派并没有让法官免于面对难以处理的考验，也没有将他们从争议范围中解脱出来，相反，它抛弃了一个已知的、可行的和可预测的标准，转而支持新的，而且可能要复杂得多的东西。

At this moment, Hong Kong is entering a new stage — moving from the transition from chaos to governance, toward the transition from governance to prosperity
当前，香港正处在从由乱到治走向由治及兴的新阶段

In 2017, he visited the People’s Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong, reviewing the troops from the back of an open-topped jeep, in what some saw as an unspoken threat of military force. 
2017年，他访问了中国人民解放军驻港部队，坐在一辆敞篷吉普车后座检阅了士兵，在一些人看来，这是一种不言而喻的武力威慑

Around the city on Friday, some residents did say the economy was their primary concern. “I don’t mind the handover either way, as long as I get my mouth fed,” As she spoke, a line of six police officers carrying shields and walkie-talkies filed past.
确实有一些香港居民周五表示，经济是他们最关心的问题。“只要能吃饱饭，我不管谁和谁交接，” 在她受访时，六名警察手持盾牌和对讲机列队走过。

Mr. Lee, 64, joined the Hong Kong police after high school, saying a childhood encounter with street thugs taught him to value justice. During his brief campaign Mr. Lee pledged to emphasize livelihood issues like access to housing and creating job opportunities for young people.
现年64岁的李家超在高中毕业后加入香港警队，他说儿时遭遇地痞流氓的经历让他认识到正义的价值。在他短暂的竞选活动中，李家超承诺要以改善生活为重，如改善住房条件和为年轻人创造就业机会。

Hong Kong has withstood one severe challenge after another, and overcome one hazard after another, After the storm, Hong Kong has been reborn from the ashes, showing flourishing vitality.
过去一个时期，香港经受一次次严峻考验，战胜一个个风险挑战，历经风雨后，香港浴火重生，展现出蓬勃的生机。

At the theater Ms. Peng watched rehearsals of two troupes, including the Tea House Rising Stars, who perform short excerpts from Cantonese operas to introduce newcomers to the genre.
在戏曲中心观看了两个剧团的排练，其中包括茶馆新星剧团，他们表演粤剧折子戏，推介这种戏曲形式。

They later peeled away sheets of shattered glass and charged inside, damaging symbols of China’s central government and spray-painting the walls with protest messages and profanities.
后来，他们清除玻璃碎片冲进立法会，损毁国徽，并在墙上用喷漆写下抗议字句和脏话。

Mr. To still had to work every day of every year, feeding dough into clanging machines and emptying so many bags of flour that everything was dusted white, even the shrine to the kitchen god. To satisfy the diverse tastes, he made tender Shanghai noodles and Cantonese egg pasta, slippery wonton wrappers from China’s south and thick dumpling skins beloved in Beijing.
年复一年，杜和每天都要工作，把面团放进叮当作响的机器里，用光一袋又一袋面粉，一切都蒙上了一层白粉，就连灶神的神龛也是如此。为了满足人们不同的口味，他做了细嫩的上海面条和广东鸡蛋面，光滑的南方云吞皮，还有北京人喜爱的厚饺子皮。

As the institutions of empire — banks, trading houses, schools, places of worship — sprouted along it, Queen’s Road was evolving, each influx of new arrivals reshaping its character. There were financial houses built on fortunes from the opium trade, gold shops promising solid investments for survivors of political turmoil, European luxury labels and merchants of shark’s fin and herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine.
随着帝国的各种机构——银行、商行、学校、宗教场所——在皇后大道涌现，街道本身也在不断演变，每一次新来者的涌入都在重塑它的特征。那里有靠鸦片贸易赚来的财富建起的金融机构，有承诺为政治动荡的幸存者提供可靠投资的金店，有欧洲奢侈品牌，还有贩卖鱼翅和中药材的商铺。

Dressed in a white lab coat, the debunker Mustafa Dhahir, a practicing pharmacist and medical student based in Australia, He has debunked claims that contraception makes women infertile, that only “natural” medicine can be trusted and that Tylenol is linked to autism. The work is often draining. Unqualified influencers posting misinformation far outnumber the experts debunking it, who are often harassed by other users for their efforts. 
身穿白色实验室大褂的辟谣者穆斯塔法·达希尔是一位生活在澳大利亚的执业药剂师和医学院学生，他驳斥了有关避孕会使女性不孕、只有“天然”药物才值得信任，以及泰诺和自闭症有关的说法。这项工作经常让人精疲力竭。发布错误信息的不合格网红数量远超辟谣的专家，后者还经常因为自己的努力而受到其他用户骚扰。

Far from retreating, Beijing has signaled a dogged commitment to its hard-line security approach, including by building up its own spheres of influence. The United States wants to hit ‘three birds with one stone’ — constraining China, destroying Russia and harming Europe
在北约宣言面前，北京不仅毫不退却，反而发出了将坚持强硬安全方针的信号，包括将继续扩大自己的势力范围。美国打着‘一石三鸟’的意图——遏华、削俄、损欧

Social conformity — and a fear of public shaming that is instilled from the youngest ages — has been a key ingredient in Japan’s relative success in Covid prevention. Unlike in the United States, wearing a mask or getting a vaccine never became ideological litmus tests.
社会顺应性——以及从小被灌输的对于当众受辱的恐惧——是日本在预防新冠方面相对成功的关键因素。与美国不同，在日本，戴口罩或疫苗接种从未成为检验意识形态的试金石。

He used painstaking preparation and rigorous argument to discredit sloppy prosecution allegations, challenge indictment charges and, occasionally, score victories. But even if you’re put in a vase, you still have the right to decide whether you’re going to be a dew-covered rose with thorns or a stick of dogtail weed.
他会一丝不苟地做准备，用严谨的论点驳斥草率的检控主张、挑战检方的控罪，偶尔能够成功。但就算是在花瓶里，你也有权利决定是插上一只含露带刺的玫瑰还是一把狗尾巴草

It also pulled back the curtain on a little-acknowledged truth about how Washington works: The capital’s power centers may be helmed largely by the geriatric set, but they are fueled by recent college graduates, often with little to no previous job experience beyond an internship. 
这些证词还让我们了解到关于华盛顿运作的一个鲜为人知的真相：首都的权力中心也许主要由一群老年人掌舵，但驱动运转的是大学毕业没多久的年轻人，他们过去通常除了实习之外几乎没有工作经验。

And while many of those young players rank low on the official food chain, their proximity to the pinnacle of power gives them disproportionate influence, and a front-row seat to critical moments that can define the country.
这些年轻的参与者中有许多处于官员食物链的底层，但他们与权力的顶峰近距离接触，这给了他们不成比例的影响力，可以坐在前排见证可能决定国家命运的关键时刻。

Yandex stood out as a rare Russian business success story, having mushroomed from a small start-up into a tech colossus that not only dominated search and ride-hailing across Russia, but boasted a growing global reach. Yandex is like the country in miniature.
央捷科斯(Yandex)还是一个罕见的俄罗斯商业成功故事，它从一家小型初创企业迅速成长为科技巨头，不仅在俄罗斯的搜索引擎和网约车领域占据主导地位，而且在全球的影响力越来越大。央捷科斯可以说是这个国家的缩影。

One of his predecessors described him as a “greased piglet”: a man who could slip out of any tight situation. In Britain, it is hard to get rid of a prime minister, but far from impossible.
他的一位前任称他为“抹了油的小猪”：一个可以摆脱任何紧张局面的人。在英国，要首相下台很难，但绝非不可能。

Poor, isolated and heavily sanctioned, North Korea has long resorted to illicit activities to gin up badly needed cash. North Korean hackers may have walked away with nearly $400 million in cryptocurrency last year, according to the crypto data firm Chainalysis. This year, North Korea’s haul is up to a little under $1 billion. 
贫穷、孤立并受到严厉制裁的朝鲜长期以来一直通过非法活动来获取急需的现金。根据加密货币数据公司Chainalysis的数据，朝鲜黑客去年可能偷走了近4亿美元的加密货币。今年，朝鲜获利略低于10亿美元。

Strict lockdown measures also kept the virus at bay, leading some to feel little urgency to get vaccinated. Even as officials began offering a mix of carrot-and-stick incentives, older people held out. 
严格的封锁措施也阻止了病毒的传播，导致一些人并不急于接种疫苗。即使官员们开始提供各种胡萝卜加大棒的激励措施，老年人仍然持观望态度。

As China has become more aggressive, more belligerent, more active in its tech sector, We need to ensure that the U.S. retains technological overmatch, As the United States continues to exploit the extraterritorial reach of its regulations, the growing threat of a regulatory ‘arms race,’ particularly with China, adds to an already jittery business environment
随着中国在科技领域变得更加激进、更加好战、更加活跃，我们需要确保美国保持技术上的优势，随着美国继续利用其监管的治外法权，监管‘军备竞赛’的威胁越来越大，尤其是与中国，这加剧了本已紧张的商业环境

As anyone knows, if you dam half the river, the water is still flowing, So the impact of broad decoupling or extensive sanctioning of China would be much more destabilizing.
大家都知道，如果你只给半边河筑坝，水还是在流，因此，广泛的脱钩或对中国的广泛制裁，会更加不稳定。

Many Chinese have grown accustomed to surveillance, censorship and frequent telemarketing calls, accepting that such intrusions were the cost of convenience and safety. The data had been stored securely on a closed-off network until someone set up a gateway that essentially punched a hole through the firewall. 
许多中国人已经习惯了监控、审查和频繁的电话营销，他们接受了这些侵扰，认为那是为了方便和安全付出的代价。数据库曾存放在有安全保护的封闭网络上，直到有人设置了一个网关，等于是在防火墙上打了个洞。

Mr. Ni made less than 50 cents a day doing factory work and odd jobs. In interviews, he described in great detail the first meal he had paid for with his earnings: a bowl of rice topped with glistening slabs of fatty barbecued pork.
一开始在工厂工作，还打零工，每天赚不到三元钱。在采访中，他非常详细地描述了用自己的收入买的第一顿饭：一碗米饭，上面放着晶莹剔透的肥美叉烧肉。

He was not speaking metaphorically. It was not an offhand comment. For a year and a half, Mr. Trump has been shielded by obfuscations and mischaracterizations
他不是在打比方。也不是随口一说。在一年半的时间里，特朗普一直受到模糊和错误描述的掩护

Each revelation was stunning on its own: Mr. Trump knew that weapons were in the crowd as he exhorted supporters to “fight like hell,” and even tried to stop anyone from disarming them. 
每一则爆料都是猛料：特朗普在怂恿支持者“玩命抗争”时知道有人持有武器，他甚至试图阻止别人去解除他们的武装。

As the political post-mortems on Mr. Johnson are written, the tumultuous events of the last week may come to encapsulate his career — one defined by a gleeful disregard for the rules, a shrewd instinct for public opinion, an elastic approach to ethics and a Falstaffian appetite for the cut-and-thrust of politics.
正如约翰逊的政治生涯终结报告所写的那样，上周的动荡事件可能会成为他职业生涯的缩影——兴高采烈地无视规则，对公众舆论的敏锐直觉，对道德的灵活态度以及法斯塔夫般嗜好政治场上的短兵相接

Mr. Johnson had long thrived by thumbing his nose at political convention. His disheveled crop of blonde hair seemed a metaphor for a messy personal and professional life, In the end, however, Mr. Johnson’s risk-taking bravado was not enough to compensate for his shortcomings.
长期以来，约翰逊对政治传统嗤之以鼻，事业也因此得以蓬勃发展。他不修边幅的金发似乎隐喻了个人生活和职业生涯的混乱，然而，最终，约翰逊冒险的虚张声势并不足以弥补他的缺点。

For months they had felt they were on their own anyway as they queued up for hours — often in vain — for fuel and cooking gas, pared down their meals and scrambled for lifesaving medicine. Now, Sri Lanka has become more of a cautionary tale.
反正几个月来，他们一直觉得自己没人管，为了得到燃料和煤气排几小时的队，却常常一无所获，他们缩衣节食，争夺救命的药物。现在，斯里兰卡更像是一则警世喻言。

The tête-à-tête followed the gathering of foreign ministers from the Group of 20 industrialized nations that ended without a traditional communiqué, reflecting the apparent impossibility of reaching a consensus amid the war in Ukraine.
这次会晤之前，20国集团外长会议没有像以往那样在结束时发表公报，由此可见在俄乌战争问题上达成共识似乎是不可能的事情

I really treasure the history of this place, from its people to the buildings, Memories live on, albeit in a different part of the world.
我真的很珍惜这个地方的历史，从这里的人到它的建筑，记忆会一直留存，尽管我会在世界的另一个地方。

For those outside of Japan, the assassination may seem incongruous with claims that Japan has found special success against gun violence. But zoom out, and the contrast between China and the United States becomes instructive. Compared with American mass shootings, Chinese knife attacks appear to be, on average, about one-tenth as deadly.
日本宣称在打击枪支暴力方面卓有成效，但对于日本以外的人来说，这场暗杀似乎表明并不是那么回事。但是退一步看，中美之间的对比就变得具有指导意义。中国持刀袭击的平均伤亡约为美国大规模枪击事件的十分之一。

In a matter of months, we will know whether the Biden administration’s gamble pays off. we will perpetuate our dependence on Chinese solar imports and forever handicap American solar production.
再过几个月，我们就会知道拜登政府的这场赌博是否值得了。我们将长期依赖中国太阳能进口，并永远阻碍美国太阳能生产。

The United States was once a global leader in both solar innovation and manufacturing — we invented photovoltaic technology in the 1950s to power satellites and spacecraft. And we retained our undisputed leadership in solar for decades. 
美国曾经是太阳能创新和制造领域的全球领导者——我们在1950年代发明了光伏技术，为卫星和航天器提供动力。几十年来，我们在太阳能领域保持了无可争议的领导地位。

Mr. Satheesh is wary of the protest winding down too soon. His plan, if the fuel shortage eases, is to start picking up fares again, to earn enough money to apply for a passport. He could then look for work as a welder in Europe or the Middle East, and sell his auto rickshaw.
萨西什不愿意抗议活动太早结束。如果燃料短缺情况缓解，他计划重新开始拉客人，赚够钱就去申请护照。然后他就可以在欧洲或者中东找一份焊工的工作，卖掉他的三轮车。

As head of human resources for a Sri Lankan company, Gimhanikari Yawasam, 41, has had to field many difficult calls from employees upset about recent salary cuts.
41岁的金哈尼卡里·亚瓦萨姆在一家斯里兰卡企业做人力主管，不得不接听许多员工的抱怨电话，他们都对最近的降薪感到不满。

Bad decisions and bad luck followed. Just as the tax cuts shrank government revenues, the pandemic devastated tourism, a vital fount of income for Sri Lanka. Facing a balance-of-payments crisis, the government banned the import of motor vehicles and synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to save hard currency and decreed an overnight transition to organic farming.
糟糕的决定和糟糕的运气接踵而至。减税削减了政府收入之际，大流行也摧毁了旅游业，而这是斯里兰卡的重要收入来源。面对收支危机，政府禁止进口汽车、合成肥料和杀虫剂以节省硬通货，并下令马上转型为有机农业。

Our hearts can’t be riding on waves, bobbing up and down. That’s bad for economic growth and social development, Entrepreneurs will gain confidence only when there are no policy contradictions. More than 10 million college graduates, a record number, are joining the job search this year. Others will take refuge in graduate school.
我们的人心不能处在波涛之上，忽高忽低，这个对经济的发展，对社会的发展都是不利的，政策没有矛盾，企业家才能有信心。今年大学应届毕业生人数达1000多万，创下历史纪录，他们中的大多数将加入到求职大军中去，有些人为避开就业竞争将去读研究生。

That sense of chaos can be difficult to square with longer-term data showing that, on many metrics, the world is generally becoming better off. War is rarer today, by some measures, than it has been for most of the past 50 years — and, when it does occur, is significantly less deadly. Genocides and mass atrocities are less common all the time, too. Life expectancy, literacy and standards of living have all risen to historic highs.
这种混乱感可能与长期数据所显示的并不一致，从许多指标来看，世界总体向好。从某种程度上说，如今的战争比过去50年的大部分时间都要少，即使发生战争，其致命程度也大大降低。种族灭绝和大规模暴行也一直在减少。预期寿命、识字率和生活水平都上升到了历史最高水平。

Health workers, stuck in full protective gear for long hours, resorted to creative ways to keep cool. Another video showed a health worker in Henan succumbing to heat stroke, panting on the ground as his colleagues fanned him with packaging from test kits.
长时间穿着全套防护装备的卫生工作者采取了各种富有创意的方法来保持凉爽。另一段视频显示，河南的一名医务工作者中暑，躺在地上呼吸困难，他的同事在用核酸检测的包装给他扇风。

When the United States first opened relations with China 50 years ago, it was relatively easy for Washington to pry China away from the Soviet Union. By 1972 when Mr. Nixon visited China, the two big Communist powers, China and the Soviet Union, had also fallen out over differences in ideology and other matters.
50年前美国与中国建交时，对于华盛顿来说，要将中国从苏联手中撬走相对容易。到1972年尼克松访华时，中国和苏联这两个共产主义大国也因意识形态和其他问题的分歧反目。

The U.S. wants climate change cooperation to be an ‘oasis’ of U.S.-China relations, However, if the oasis is surrounded by deserts then sooner or later, the ‘oasis’ will be desertified.
美方希气变合作成为中美关系的‘绿洲’，但如‘绿洲’周围都是‘荒漠’，‘绿洲’迟早会被沙化。

The Webb presentation gave us gasp-inducing images of the Southern Ring Nebula, a sphere of gas and dust belched by a dying star, Seen in infrared, the nebula resembled a looming, eroded coastal cliff dotted with hundreds of stars that astronomers had never seen before.
韦伯的发布给我们带来了令人惊叹的图像，包括南环星云，这是由一颗垂死的恒星喷出的气体和尘埃组成的球体；用红外线观察，这个星云就像一座被侵蚀的海岸悬崖，若隐若现，上面点缀着数百颗天文学家从未见过的恒星。

His energy level, while impressive for a man of his age, is not what it was, and some aides quietly watch out for him. He often shuffles when he walks, and aides worry he will trip on a wire. He stumbles over words during public events, and they hold their breath to see if he makes it to the end without a gaffe.
虽然与同龄人相比，他的精力已经很充沛了，但还是不如从前，一些助手悄悄地关照着他。他走路有时不稳，助手们担心他会被电线绊倒。在公开场合，他说话会颠三倒四，导致助手们紧张万分，担心他出现失言。

Biden’s “ambulatory gait is perceptibly stiffer and less fluid than it was a year or so ago,” the report said, and gastroesophageal reflux causes him to cough and clear his throat, symptoms that “certainly seem to be more frequent and more pronounced.” he had atrial fibrillation but that it was stable and asymptomatic.
报告称，拜登“与一年前相比，步态明显更为僵硬，更不流畅”，胃食管反流导致他咳嗽和清嗓子，这些症状“显然看来更频繁、更明显”。他有心房颤动，但状态稳定且无症状。

But what local politicians lauded as an unambiguous win soon divided Grand Forks. Trying to unwind that relationship could mean higher prices and slower growth. Most of the debate has been within the mainstream of today’s political discourse, echoing some of the nationalist
但当地政客口中再明确不过的胜利很快就让大福克斯市陷入分裂。试图解除这种关系可能会导致物价提升和增长放缓。大部分相关争论都属于当今主流政治话术，呼应了某些民族主义的主题

They worried about whether the city had enough water to support the facility’s wet-milling process, which extracts amino acids from corn. They worried about odor. About traffic.
他们担心这座城市的水源是否足以支持工厂从玉米中提取氨基酸的湿磨过程。他们担心异味，也担心交通拥堵。

I personally think that our City Council has been sold a bill of goods by Fufeng and they have stars in their eyes because they see money coming in, they see growth coming in.
我个人以为，我们的市议会被阜丰忽悠得团团转，他们两眼放光，因为看到了资金流入，看到了增长。

But a few opponents of the project have espoused far-fetched theories, or used language that some considered anti-Asian scaremongering. All of it caught city leaders off guard.
但该项目的一些反对者要么提出的理论牵强附会，要么使用的语言被一些人认为是反亚裔的危言耸听。这一切都让城市领导人措手不及。

Semantics matter to people, and the things we say to people make them feel welcomed or like they don’t belong here, Several opponents of the mill said they harbored no ill will toward Chinese people or Asian Americans
语言对人们很重要，我们对别人说的话会让他们觉得自己究竟是受到欢迎，还是不招人待见，该工厂的几名反对者表示，他们对中国人或亚裔美国人没有恶意

At the root of this torment is a force so elemental that it has almost ceased to warrant mention — the pandemic. That force is far from spent, confronting policymakers with grave uncertainty. Their policy tools are better suited for more typical downturns, not a rare combination of diminishing economic growth and soaring prices.
造成这一痛苦的根源是一种根本到几乎不需要再提的力量——大流行。这股力量还远未耗尽，使得决策者面临着严重的不确定性。他们的政策工具更适合比较典型的衰退，而不是经济增长放缓和物价飙升的罕见组合。

But the endurance of stance — its willingness to continue riding out the economic damage and public anger — constitutes one of the more consequential variables in a world brimming with uncertainty.
但在这个充满不确定性的世界里，政府立场的持久性——它是否愿意继续承受经济损失和公众愤怒——是影响更大的变数之一。

Raising rates would support the euro, which has surrendered more than 10 percent of its value against the dollar this year. But Europe is confronting not only weakening growth but also soaring prices, which customarily calls for lifting rates to snuff out spending. Navigating the balance between protecting jobs and choking off inflation is difficult enough in simpler times. 
加息将支撑欧元，欧元兑美元汇率今年已下跌逾10%。但欧洲面临的不仅是增长疲软，还有物价飙升，这通常要求加息以抑制支出。在相对简单的情况下，在保护就业和抑制通胀之间找到平衡已经够困难的了。

When Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Mr. Kishida strongly condemned Russia’s actions without hesitation and swiftly enacted sanctions. Eight years earlier, Mr. Abe, keen to foster a relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin, had dragged his feet on imposing sanctions after Russia annexed Crimea. 
当俄罗斯2月入侵乌克兰时，岸田文雄毫不犹豫地强烈谴责了俄罗斯的行为，并迅速实施了制裁。八年前，渴望与俄罗斯总统普京发展关系的安倍晋三在俄罗斯吞并克里米亚后迟迟没有实施制裁。

Mr. Kishida was a strong drinker but a boring talker, He has also quietly differentiated himself from his predecessor. Mr. Kishida started out by trying to distinguish himself from Mr. Abe, offering a “new capitalism” as a departure from Mr. Abe’s well-known economic platform, dubbed “Abenomics.” 
岸田文雄酒量很大，但说话无聊，他也悄悄表明自己同前任的差异。他提出了一种“新资本主义”，与安倍晋三著名的经济纲领“安倍经济学”背道而驰。

Sun, sand, sightings of celebrities in their natural habitats: Tourists have long descended on Los Angeles for some combination of the above.
阳光、沙滩，随处可见怡然自得的名人——长久以来，洛杉矶就以这些特征吸引着游客的到来。

Los Angeles’ comeback story is well underway, We’re optimistic that we’ll see full recovery in Los Angeles by the end of 2023
洛杉矶的逆袭正在顺利进行，我们乐观地认为，到2023年底，洛杉矶将全面复苏

If Los Angeles wasn’t the nation’s preeminent city for sushi before, it is now. Low-carb cliches be damned, pizza is having a moment. Los Angeles added 2,100 new hotel rooms in 2021, and there’s a home away from home for every type of traveler. 
就算以前不是，如今的洛杉矶也是全美首屈一指的寿司之都。把低碳健康的陈词滥调抛到一边，披萨才是正当红的美食。2021年，洛杉矶新增了2100间酒店客房，保证每一种类型的旅行者都能感受到宾至如归。

Last week, with rising oil prices damaging him politically, President Biden traveled to Jeddah and bestowed a fist bump on the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.
然而随着油价上涨对拜登造成了政治上的损害，上周，他前往吉达并和沙特王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼碰拳问候。

Despite their differences on Syria, the leaders took care to exude bonhomie. Mr. Erdogan did not back down, at least publicly.
尽管在叙利亚问题上存在分歧，几位领导人一直有意表现出其乐融融的样子。埃尔多安没有让步，至少没有公开这样做。

Extreme heat is becoming increasingly common across the globe, with longer, more frequent heat waves spreading each year. These rising temperatures can put many at risk for heat-related illnesses, including heat stroke and heat exhaustion. 
极端高温在全球越来越普遍，热浪的持续时间和出现频率逐年增加。不断上升的气温令许多人有可能罹患热射病和热衰竭等与高温有关的疾病。

With his lucky Pooh bear perched somewhere in the rink, Hanyu performed with a rare combination of grace and power, skating across the ice as smoothly as a gently flowing river before rocketing into technically difficult jumps that made his competitors gasp in admiration.
羽生结弦的幸运维尼熊在冰场的某个地方安静地等待着。他的表演是一种罕见的优雅与力量的结合，像一条缓缓流淌的河流一样平稳地滑过冰面，然后迅速进入高难度跳跃，让他的竞争对手赞叹不已。

He was equal parts Evgeni Plushenko (known for his jumping) and Johnny Weir (a master of artistry). Emulating two of his skating heroes made Hanyu arguably the most well-rounded skater in the sport’s history. His goal was to appeal to all people, not just die-hard skating fans or fans from his home country of Japan, and he succeeded.
他是叶夫根尼·普鲁申科（以跳跃闻名）和约翰尼·威尔（艺术表现大师）的结合。羽生结弦对他的这两位滑冰英雄的模仿，使他成为花滑历史上最全方位发展的运动员。他的目标是吸引所有人，而不仅仅是铁杆滑冰爱好者或祖国日本的粉丝，他成功了。

The death, by euthanasia, was announced by the park. As the news of An An’s death spread, an outpouring of condolences flowed online from the public. An An had “brought us fond memories with numerous heartwarming moments. His cleverness and playfulness will be dearly missed.”
公园宣布已为安安施行了安乐死，随着安安逝世的消息传开，民众在网上纷纷表达哀悼。安安“为大家带来无数欢乐回忆，我们将永远怀念它聪敏和调皮的身影”。

While the United States likes to wrap its alliances in grandiloquent words about shared values and democracy, The Turks continue to play both sides against the middle and they are in a very strong position to do so, It’s a highly profitable game politically, economically and strategically — but that excludes any new alliance.
美国喜欢用关于共同价值观和民主的华丽词藻来包装其联盟，土耳其人继续搞鹬蚌相争、渔翁得利那一套，他们在这方面处于非常有利的地位，这是一个在政治、经济和战略上都非常有利可图的游戏——但这不包括任何新的联盟。

Historically, of course, such statements didn’t always survive scrutiny. Real-time reports on Donald Trump’s condition when he tested positive for the coronavirus in October 2020 turned out to wildly understate how sick he was. 
当然，从历史上看，这样的说法并不总能经得起推敲。2020年10月特朗普的新冠病毒检测呈阳性时，有关他病情的实时报道被证明大大低估了他的病情。

The long-dominant L.D.P. and its allies secured the two-thirds majority in Parliament’s upper house required to initiate a national referendum on amending the Constitution. But that was widely expected even before Mr. Abe’s murder, and the ruling coalition’s gains stemmed in part from divisions within the opposition rather than a pro-Abe groundswell. It’s time to beat Mr. Abe’s swords into plowshares.
长期占据主导地位的自民党及其盟友在参议院赢得了三分之二的多数席位，满足了修宪问题发起全民公投的必要条件。但早在安倍晋三被刺之前，人们就普遍预料到了这会发生，在一定程度上，执政联盟之所以赢得更多席位是因为反对派内部出现了分歧，而不是亲安倍情绪高涨。是化安倍晋三的干戈为玉帛的时候了。

A new book, “Streets of Gold: America’s Untold Story of Immigrant Success,” wrote that America really does have golden streets that allow immigrants to quickly make more than they could have earned at home,
新书《遍地黄金——美国不为人知的移民成功故事》写道美国确实遍地黄金，让移民能迅速赚到比他们在本国更多的钱。

The children had an easy time outdoing parents whose careers were inhibited by poor language skills or a lack of professional credentials. The classic example is an immigrant doctor who winds up driving a cab in the United States.
孩子们很容易超越那些因语言能力差或缺乏职业资质而发展受阻的父母。一个典型的例子是，一个移民医生最后在美国开出租车。

In slapping China’s ride-hailing giant, Didi Global, with a record $1.2 billion fine for data breaches, Beijing made clear to the country’s internet companies that their freewheeling days were over. The authorities’ concerns about data security are not unfounded. In the short term, the government will probably relent on Didi, allowing it to restore its apps in stores. 
中国政府以数据泄露为由，对网约车巨头滴滴全球股份有限公司开出了80.26亿元人民币的创纪录罚单。这是在明确告知中国的互联网企业，随心所欲的日子已经结束。当局对数据安全的担忧并非毫无根据。短期内，政府可能会放滴滴一马，允许其应用程序在网店重新上架。

And when you look at how social media has divided Western societies and amplified lies and liars, you’d also have to ask whether China has not both lost something and gained something from its tighter controls.
当你看到社交媒体如何分裂西方社会并放大谎言和纵容说谎者时，你不得不问，中国算不算从更严格的控制中失之东隅，收之桑榆。
