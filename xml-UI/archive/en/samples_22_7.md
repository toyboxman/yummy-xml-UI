The unilateral sanctions and so-called ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ imposed by the U.S. on other countries in accordance with its domestic laws are against international law and basic norms governing international relations
美方依据国内法对其他国家实施单边制裁和所谓‘长臂管辖’，违反国际法和国际关系基本准则

By one economic theory, the choice of whether to obey the law is like any other decision, a weighing of costs and benefits. But you know from personal experience that’s not true. There are plenty of times you could have lied, cheated or stolen with impunity. You did the right thing anyway because you more or less accepted the legitimacy of the laws, how they were enacted and how the people who enacted them were selected.
根据一种经济学理论，是否遵守法律的选择就像任何其他决定一样，是对成本和收益的权衡。但是通过个人经历，你就知道事实并非如此。很多时候，你可以撒谎、欺骗或偷窃而不受惩罚。但你还是做了正确的事，因为你或多或少接受了法律的正当性，接受了法律是如何制定，以及制定法律的人是如何被选出的

The majority does not save judges from unwieldy tests or extricate them from the sphere of controversy, To the contrary, it discards a known, workable and predictable standard in favor of something novel and probably far more complicated.
多数派并没有让法官免于面对难以处理的考验，也没有将他们从争议范围中解脱出来，相反，它抛弃了一个已知的、可行的和可预测的标准，转而支持新的，而且可能要复杂得多的东西。

Hong Kong has withstood one severe challenge after another, and overcome one hazard after another, After the storm, Hong Kong has been reborn from the ashes, showing flourishing vitality.

They later peeled away sheets of shattered glass and charged inside, damaging symbols of China’s central government and spray-painting the walls with protest messages and profanities.
后来，他们清除玻璃碎片冲进立法会，损毁国徽，并在墙上用喷漆写下抗议字句和脏话。

Mr. To still had to work every day of every year, feeding dough into clanging machines and emptying so many bags of flour that everything was dusted white, even the shrine to the kitchen god. To satisfy the diverse tastes, he made tender Shanghai noodles and Cantonese egg pasta, slippery wonton wrappers from China’s south and thick dumpling skins beloved in Beijing.
年复一年，杜和每天都要工作，把面团放进叮当作响的机器里，用光一袋又一袋面粉，一切都蒙上了一层白粉，就连灶神的神龛也是如此。为了满足人们不同的口味，他做了细嫩的上海面条和广东鸡蛋面，光滑的南方云吞皮，还有北京人喜爱的厚饺子皮。

As the institutions of empire — banks, trading houses, schools, places of worship — sprouted along it, Queen’s Road was evolving, each influx of new arrivals reshaping its character. There were financial houses built on fortunes from the opium trade, gold shops promising solid investments for survivors of political turmoil, European luxury labels and merchants of shark’s fin and herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine.
随着帝国的各种机构——银行、商行、学校、宗教场所——在皇后大道涌现，街道本身也在不断演变，每一次新来者的涌入都在重塑它的特征。那里有靠鸦片贸易赚来的财富建起的金融机构，有承诺为政治动荡的幸存者提供可靠投资的金店，有欧洲奢侈品牌，还有贩卖鱼翅和中药材的商铺。

Dressed in a white lab coat, the debunker Mustafa Dhahir, a practicing pharmacist and medical student based in Australia, He has debunked claims that contraception makes women infertile, that only “natural” medicine can be trusted and that Tylenol is linked to autism. The work is often draining. Unqualified influencers posting misinformation far outnumber the experts debunking it, who are often harassed by other users for their efforts. 
身穿白色实验室大褂的辟谣者穆斯塔法·达希尔是一位生活在澳大利亚的执业药剂师和医学院学生，他驳斥了有关避孕会使女性不孕、只有“天然”药物才值得信任，以及泰诺和自闭症有关的说法。这项工作经常让人精疲力竭。发布错误信息的不合格网红数量远超辟谣的专家，后者还经常因为自己的努力而受到其他用户骚扰。

Far from retreating, Beijing has signaled a dogged commitment to its hard-line security approach, including by building up its own spheres of influence. The United States wants to hit ‘three birds with one stone’ — constraining China, destroying Russia and harming Europe
在北约宣言面前，北京不仅毫不退却，反而发出了将坚持强硬安全方针的信号，包括将继续扩大自己的势力范围。美国打着‘一石三鸟’的意图——遏华、削俄、损欧

Social conformity — and a fear of public shaming that is instilled from the youngest ages — has been a key ingredient in Japan’s relative success in Covid prevention. Unlike in the United States, wearing a mask or getting a vaccine never became ideological litmus tests.
社会顺应性——以及从小被灌输的对于当众受辱的恐惧——是日本在预防新冠方面相对成功的关键因素。与美国不同，在日本，戴口罩或疫苗接种从未成为检验意识形态的试金石。

He used painstaking preparation and rigorous argument to discredit sloppy prosecution allegations, challenge indictment charges and, occasionally, score victories. But even if you’re put in a vase, you still have the right to decide whether you’re going to be a dew-covered rose with thorns or a stick of dogtail weed.
他会一丝不苟地做准备，用严谨的论点驳斥草率的检控主张、挑战检方的控罪，偶尔能够成功。但就算是在花瓶里，你也有权利决定是插上一只含露带刺的玫瑰还是一把狗尾巴草

It also pulled back the curtain on a little-acknowledged truth about how Washington works: The capital’s power centers may be helmed largely by the geriatric set, but they are fueled by recent college graduates, often with little to no previous job experience beyond an internship. 
这些证词还让我们了解到关于华盛顿运作的一个鲜为人知的真相：首都的权力中心也许主要由一群老年人掌舵，但驱动运转的是大学毕业没多久的年轻人，他们过去通常除了实习之外几乎没有工作经验。

And while many of those young players rank low on the official food chain, their proximity to the pinnacle of power gives them disproportionate influence, and a front-row seat to critical moments that can define the country.
这些年轻的参与者中有许多处于官员食物链的底层，但他们与权力的顶峰近距离接触，这给了他们不成比例的影响力，可以坐在前排见证可能决定国家命运的关键时刻。

Yandex stood out as a rare Russian business success story, having mushroomed from a small start-up into a tech colossus that not only dominated search and ride-hailing across Russia, but boasted a growing global reach. Yandex is like the country in miniature.
央捷科斯(Yandex)还是一个罕见的俄罗斯商业成功故事，它从一家小型初创企业迅速成长为科技巨头，不仅在俄罗斯的搜索引擎和网约车领域占据主导地位，而且在全球的影响力越来越大。央捷科斯可以说是这个国家的缩影。

One of his predecessors described him as a “greased piglet”: a man who could slip out of any tight situation. In Britain, it is hard to get rid of a prime minister, but far from impossible.
他的一位前任称他为“抹了油的小猪”：一个可以摆脱任何紧张局面的人。在英国，要首相下台很难，但绝非不可能。

Poor, isolated and heavily sanctioned, North Korea has long resorted to illicit activities to gin up badly needed cash. North Korean hackers may have walked away with nearly $400 million in cryptocurrency last year, according to the crypto data firm Chainalysis. This year, North Korea’s haul is up to a little under $1 billion. 
贫穷、孤立并受到严厉制裁的朝鲜长期以来一直通过非法活动来获取急需的现金。根据加密货币数据公司Chainalysis的数据，朝鲜黑客去年可能偷走了近4亿美元的加密货币。今年，朝鲜获利略低于10亿美元。

Strict lockdown measures also kept the virus at bay, leading some to feel little urgency to get vaccinated. Even as officials began offering a mix of carrot-and-stick incentives, older people held out. 
严格的封锁措施也阻止了病毒的传播，导致一些人并不急于接种疫苗。即使官员们开始提供各种胡萝卜加大棒的激励措施，老年人仍然持观望态度。

As China has become more aggressive, more belligerent, more active in its tech sector, We need to ensure that the U.S. retains technological overmatch, As the United States continues to exploit the extraterritorial reach of its regulations, the growing threat of a regulatory ‘arms race,’ particularly with China, adds to an already jittery business environment
随着中国在科技领域变得更加激进、更加好战、更加活跃，我们需要确保美国保持技术上的优势，随着美国继续利用其监管的治外法权，监管‘军备竞赛’的威胁越来越大，尤其是与中国，这加剧了本已紧张的商业环境

As anyone knows, if you dam half the river, the water is still flowing, So the impact of broad decoupling or extensive sanctioning of China would be much more destabilizing.
大家都知道，如果你只给半边河筑坝，水还是在流，因此，广泛的脱钩或对中国的广泛制裁，会更加不稳定。

Many Chinese have grown accustomed to surveillance, censorship and frequent telemarketing calls, accepting that such intrusions were the cost of convenience and safety. The data had been stored securely on a closed-off network until someone set up a gateway that essentially punched a hole through the firewall. 
许多中国人已经习惯了监控、审查和频繁的电话营销，他们接受了这些侵扰，认为那是为了方便和安全付出的代价。数据库曾存放在有安全保护的封闭网络上，直到有人设置了一个网关，等于是在防火墙上打了个洞。

Mr. Ni made less than 50 cents a day doing factory work and odd jobs. In interviews, he described in great detail the first meal he had paid for with his earnings: a bowl of rice topped with glistening slabs of fatty barbecued pork.
一开始在工厂工作，还打零工，每天赚不到三元钱。在采访中，他非常详细地描述了用自己的收入买的第一顿饭：一碗米饭，上面放着晶莹剔透的肥美叉烧肉。

He was not speaking metaphorically. It was not an offhand comment. For a year and a half, Mr. Trump has been shielded by obfuscations and mischaracterizations
他不是在打比方。也不是随口一说。在一年半的时间里，特朗普一直受到模糊和错误描述的掩护

Each revelation was stunning on its own: Mr. Trump knew that weapons were in the crowd as he exhorted supporters to “fight like hell,” and even tried to stop anyone from disarming them. 
每一则爆料都是猛料：特朗普在怂恿支持者“玩命抗争”时知道有人持有武器，他甚至试图阻止别人去解除他们的武装。

As the political post-mortems on Mr. Johnson are written, the tumultuous events of the last week may come to encapsulate his career — one defined by a gleeful disregard for the rules, a shrewd instinct for public opinion, an elastic approach to ethics and a Falstaffian appetite for the cut-and-thrust of politics.
正如约翰逊的政治生涯终结报告所写的那样，上周的动荡事件可能会成为他职业生涯的缩影——兴高采烈地无视规则，对公众舆论的敏锐直觉，对道德的灵活态度以及法斯塔夫般嗜好政治场上的短兵相接

Mr. Johnson had long thrived by thumbing his nose at political convention. His disheveled crop of blonde hair seemed a metaphor for a messy personal and professional life, In the end, however, Mr. Johnson’s risk-taking bravado was not enough to compensate for his shortcomings.
长期以来，约翰逊对政治传统嗤之以鼻，事业也因此得以蓬勃发展。他不修边幅的金发似乎隐喻了个人生活和职业生涯的混乱，然而，最终，约翰逊冒险的虚张声势并不足以弥补他的缺点。

For months they had felt they were on their own anyway as they queued up for hours — often in vain — for fuel and cooking gas, pared down their meals and scrambled for lifesaving medicine. Now, Sri Lanka has become more of a cautionary tale.
反正几个月来，他们一直觉得自己没人管，为了得到燃料和煤气排几小时的队，却常常一无所获，他们缩衣节食，争夺救命的药物。现在，斯里兰卡更像是一则警世喻言。
