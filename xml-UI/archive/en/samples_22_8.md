The U.S. and a few other countries have been hyping up the landing of the Chinese rocket debris over the past few days, To date, no damage by the landing debris has been reported. She likened the Chinese space program as a tortoise compared to the American hare
这几天大家都非常关心中国火箭残骸坠落的问题，火箭末级已再入大气层，没有对地面造成危害的报道。她把中国的太空计划和美国的太空计划比作龟兔赛跑，中国是乌龟，美国是兔子

Bullies often seek tests of strengths to probe for signs of weakness. And they always read efforts at conciliation as evidence of capitulation. That’s what’s happening now. “To win 100 victories in 100 battles is not the acme of skill,” Sun Tzu wrote. “To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.”
欺凌者经常寻求力量测试，以探查弱点的迹象。他们总是将调解努力视为投降的证据。现在的情况就是这样。孙子说：“是故百战百胜，非善之善者也；不战而屈人之兵，善之善者也。”

One facing southern Taiwan, “creates conditions to bolt the door and beat the dog,” he said, using a Chinese saying that refers to blocking an enemy’s escape route. He signaled that a bigger show of force using live ammunition was on the way. Under the guise of signaling, they’re trying to basically test their ability to conduct complex maneuvers that are necessary for an amphibious assault on Taiwan.
还有一个面向台湾南部，“形成关门打狗之势”，他说，这是一句中国的俗话，指的是封锁敌人的退路。他表示，使用实弹的更大规模武力展示即将开始。表面是发出信号的幌子，其实是想要测试对台湾进行两栖攻击所必需的复杂调动能力。

Mr. Biden and his political aides are keenly aware of the rising anti-free-trade sentiment in the United States that Mr. Trump capitalized on to marshal votes. That awareness has led Mr. Biden to shy away from trying to re-enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership
拜登及其政治助手完全明白特朗普在利用美国国内日益高涨的反自由贸易情绪拉票。这一认知让拜登不愿尝试重新加入《跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》

Decades earlier, a reform-minded scholar said that even the moon in the United States was rounder than in China. My schoolmates and I wanted to believe it. But after years of watching America’s wars overseas, reckless economic policies and destructive partisanship — culminating in last year’s disgraceful assault on the U.S. Capitol ­­— many Chinese, including me, can barely make out that shining beacon anymore.
几十年前，一位改革派学者说，美国的月亮比中国的圆。我和我的同学都愿意相信这一点。但多年来，看到美国在海外的战争、鲁莽的经济政策和破坏性的党同伐异——最终导致去年对美国国会大厦的一场可耻的攻击——包括我在内的许多中国人几乎看不到那座闪亮的灯塔了。

When we look at America’s enormous pandemic toll, gun violence, political divisions and the attack on the U.S. Capitol, it only reminds Chinese people of our own chaotic past that we have left behind. None of this is meant to gloat over America’s troubles; a strong, stable and responsible United States is good for the world. China still has much to learn from America, and we have a lot in common.
当我们看到美国大流行造成大量死亡、枪支暴力、政治分歧和对美国国会大厦的袭击时，这些只会让中国人想起我们自己抛在身后的混乱过去。这一切都不是对美国的幸灾乐祸。一个强大、稳定和负责任的美国对世界有利。中国还有很多东西要向美国学习，我们有很多共同点

Taiwan is usually treated as a marginalized pawn on the chessboard of the big powers and portrayed as such by the global media. Ms. Pelosi’s trip was a perfect example. 
台湾通常被视为大国棋盘上遭到边缘化的棋子，全球媒体也是这样描绘它的。佩洛西的访问就是一个很好的例子。

Over the years, Seoul has offered to help those living in such basement apartments, providing them with pumps and other equipment to fight floods. It has also renovated sewer systems in low-lying districts to help drain rainwater more quickly.
多年来，首尔一直在主动帮助住在这种地下室公寓里的人，为他们提供水泵和其他防洪设备。政府还对低洼地区的下水道系统进行了改造，以便更快地排水。

They build small dikes with sandbags around their homes. When the floodwater recedes, they put their clothing and furniture in alleyways to dry. 
他们用沙袋在房屋周围筑起小堤坝。洪水退去后，他们把衣服和家具放在巷子里晾干。

when President Yoon Suk-yeol visited the neighbor​hood where the family of three died, their home was still filled with waist-high​ floodwater. Pillows, furniture and plastic bags floated inside. Mr. Yoon had to squat on the street outside to look down into the home through the street-level window.
韩国总统尹锡悦前往死者一家所在的社区时，他们的家仍然被齐腰高的洪水淹没。枕头、家具和塑料袋漂浮在里面。尹锡悦只得蹲在外面的街上，从临街的窗户往房间里看。

When people stop queuing up for visas in front of the U.S. consulates, then the U.S. is in decline.
当美国领事馆前等待签证的队伍不再人头攒动时，才是美国真正衰落之日

Mr. Schumer, who helped spearhead the measure, at one point hinted at the yearslong quest to secure its passage when he noted that it had once been called the Endless Frontier Act — one of a handful of names for the bill as it made its way through Congress. There were ups and downs, and it was a long path to get here
舒默是该法案的推动者之一，他一度暗示该法案可能需要多年的努力才能通过，他指出，该法案曾被称为《无尽前沿法案》，这是在国会审议过程中使用的名称之一。走到这一步的过程很漫长，有许多起起落落

Boasting a direct view of the Chinese city of Xiamen just six miles away, it is built atop an old military bunker, festooned with camouflage netting, and serves hot and cold beverages.
这里可以直接看到10公里外的中国城市厦门，咖啡馆建在一处废弃的军事掩体上，装饰着迷彩网，供应冷热饮料。

He’s always keen to dig a little bit more, to digest specifics, to understand the intent behind a movement or a step, After working together on ‘Reflections,’ it was completely evident to me that Chun Wai had a tremendous work ethic, focus and onstage presence. He’s got this magnetic quality onstage, He can be elegant, very naturally, but he also can be really dynamic. He just draws you in.
他总是热衷于挖掘更多的东西，消化细节，理解一个动作或一个步子背后的意图，在合作《反思》之后，我完全可以看出，镇威有着极高的职业道德、专注力和舞台表现力。他在舞台上极具磁性，他可以很优雅，很自然，也可以很有活力。他就是会吸引着你。

Unless political security is assured, the country will inevitably fall apart, scattering like a box of sand, and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will be out of the question, Hostile forces at home and abroad have never let up for one moment in their strategy to Westernize and split apart our country
如果政治安全得不到保障，国家必然会陷入四分五裂、一盘散沙的局面，中华民族伟大复兴就无从谈起. 国内外敌对势力对我国进行西化和分裂战略一刻也没有松懈过

Don’t simplistically equate ‘nothing has gone wrong’ with ‘nothing will go wrong,’ At every moment always act as if we’re walking on thin ice, as if on the edge of an abyss. In defending national security, nobody is an outsider or a bystander
不能简单地把‘没出事’视同‘没有事’，时时刻刻做到如履薄冰、如临深渊。在维护国家安全上，人人都不是局外人、旁观者

But some American officials say they are realizing that Vietnamese leaders want to straddle the fence with both superpowers.
但有美国官员说，他们渐渐认识到，越南领导人希望在两个大国的对抗中成为一个骑墙派。

We’re maintaining a high state of alert, ready for battle at all times, able to fight at any time, We have the determination and ability to mount a painful direct attack against any invaders who would wreck unification of the motherland, and would show no mercy.
保持全时待战，随时能战的高度戒备状态，我们有决心有能力，对一切破坏祖国的来犯之敌迎头痛击，绝不留情。

Chinese state media covered the exercises breathlessly, and the response from much of Chinese social media was ecstatic.
中国的官方媒体对演习做了连篇累牍的报道，在中国的社交媒体上，人们对此欣喜若狂

We must clearly understand the severe direction of struggle in the Taiwan Strait, Only by really preparing to fight is peace possible. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation won’t be an effortless task achieved just by fanfare of gongs and drums,
要清醒认识台海斗争的严峻形势，只有真正做好‘打’的准备，才有‘和’的可能。中华民族伟大复兴不是轻轻松松、敲锣打鼓就能实现的

I’m about to use four words in a row that I haven’t used in this way before, This isn’t something that came out of the blue
这几个词我从来没有这样连起来用过，这不是无端发生的事

If anyone dares to split off Taiwan, we will not hesitate to fight, will not flinch from the cost and will fight to the very end
如果有人胆敢把台湾分裂出去，我们一定会不惜一战、不惜代价

Patience for visionaries wore thin. Founder-led companies started to seem like liabilities, not assets. It’s surely less fun being a C.E.O. when markets are down, the economy is trending negative and regulation is increasing, If you’re as already rich, famous and successful as these guys, there usually comes a point where staying in the saddle is less appealing than riding off into the sunset.
人们对梦想家的耐心越来越少。由创始人领导的公司如今看起来像是负债，而不是资产。当市场低迷、经济趋于负面、监管不断加强的时候，做首席执行官肯定没那么有趣了，如果你已经像这些人一样富有、有名、成功，那么通常到了一个时刻，纵马向夕阳比留在原地更有吸引力。

In every village in Hainan, there is a communal open-air space, like a square. People would bring their clothes during the day to dry under the burning sun or put the rice out to dry. At night, people would sit there, the guys would take their shirts off, to get cool and to fall asleep.
在海南的每个村庄都有一个公共的露天空间，就像一个广场。白天，人们把衣服拿来，放在烈日下晾晒，或者在这里晒稻谷。晚上大家会坐在那里，男人们会打赤膊，为了凉快、好睡觉。

The overture of “Madama Butterfly” is very fast and energetic, in a minor key, that sounds very Western. I turned the overture upside down. I used the Puccini motif, and I reversed it. I made it quasi-pentatonic, to make it more Eastern. And then I have an opera gong, crash cymbal and all these instruments go along with it. 
《蝴蝶夫人》的序曲非常快，充满活力，以小调谱写，听起来很西方。我对其进行了反转。我使用了普契尼的母题，然后将它反过来。我把它变成了准五声音阶，让它听上去更东方。我还用了京剧里的锣、铙钹等乐器来配合。

There is no catharsis for the people living in the frontline regions. Instead, they seem overwhelmed by the vastness of what is going on around them — as if it’s an existential threat too big for them to do anything about. So they wait numbly for what often seems the inevitable outcome, hypnotized by indecision, all while often forgetting they are directly in harm’s way.
生活在前线地区的人们没有宣泄。他们似乎对周围发生的事情反而感到不知所措——这就像一个巨大的生存威胁，大到让人只能坐以待毙。因此，他们麻木地等待通常看似不可避免的结果到来，在举棋不定中催眠自己，同时经常忘记他们正处于危险之中。

Some of the North Koreans with fever symptoms may have had diseases like whooping cough, measles or typhoid. South Korea ​has ​said that it is impossible for the balloon launches to have brought Covid-19 into the North, saying it had consulted disease-control experts on the issue. O​n Thursday, the South Korean government called Ms. Kim’s accusation “far-fetched” and “very rude.”
一些有发烧症状的朝鲜人可能患的是百日咳、麻疹或伤寒等疾病。韩国表示，不可能通过发送气球将新冠带入朝鲜，并表示已就此问题咨询了疾病控制专家。周四，韩国政府称金与正的指控“牵强”和“非常无礼”。

But the Afghan forces were already beginning to buckle. By the end of the summer, the insurgents had seized dozens of districts, rapidly sweeping across the countryside as outpost after outpost folded. President Ashraf Ghani had reshuffled his military leadership, and militia units led by the powerful and notorious warlords of Afghanistan’s past had taken up arms to defend their economic fiefs.
但是阿富汗军队已经开始屈服。到夏天结束时，叛乱分子已占领了数十个地区，随着一个又一个前哨沦陷，他们迅速席卷了整个乡村。阿富汗总统阿什拉夫·加尼改组了军事领导层，让昔日那些强大而臭名昭著的军阀领导的民兵部队拿起武器，捍卫自己的经济领地。
