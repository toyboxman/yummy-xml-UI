The U.S. and a few other countries have been hyping up the landing of the Chinese rocket debris over the past few days, To date, no damage by the landing debris has been reported. She likened the Chinese space program as a tortoise compared to the American hare
这几天大家都非常关心中国火箭残骸坠落的问题，火箭末级已再入大气层，没有对地面造成危害的报道。她把中国的太空计划和美国的太空计划比作龟兔赛跑，中国是乌龟，美国是兔子

Bullies often seek tests of strengths to probe for signs of weakness. And they always read efforts at conciliation as evidence of capitulation. That’s what’s happening now. “To win 100 victories in 100 battles is not the acme of skill,” Sun Tzu wrote. “To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.”
欺凌者经常寻求力量测试，以探查弱点的迹象。他们总是将调解努力视为投降的证据。现在的情况就是这样。孙子说：“是故百战百胜，非善之善者也；不战而屈人之兵，善之善者也。”

One facing southern Taiwan, “creates conditions to bolt the door and beat the dog,” he said, using a Chinese saying that refers to blocking an enemy’s escape route. He signaled that a bigger show of force using live ammunition was on the way. Under the guise of signaling, they’re trying to basically test their ability to conduct complex maneuvers that are necessary for an amphibious assault on Taiwan.
还有一个面向台湾南部，“形成关门打狗之势”，他说，这是一句中国的俗话，指的是封锁敌人的退路。他表示，使用实弹的更大规模武力展示即将开始。表面是发出信号的幌子，其实是想要测试对台湾进行两栖攻击所必需的复杂调动能力。

Mr. Biden and his political aides are keenly aware of the rising anti-free-trade sentiment in the United States that Mr. Trump capitalized on to marshal votes. That awareness has led Mr. Biden to shy away from trying to re-enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership
拜登及其政治助手完全明白特朗普在利用美国国内日益高涨的反自由贸易情绪拉票。这一认知让拜登不愿尝试重新加入《跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》

Decades earlier, a reform-minded scholar said that even the moon in the United States was rounder than in China. My schoolmates and I wanted to believe it. But after years of watching America’s wars overseas, reckless economic policies and destructive partisanship — culminating in last year’s disgraceful assault on the U.S. Capitol ­­— many Chinese, including me, can barely make out that shining beacon anymore.
几十年前，一位改革派学者说，美国的月亮比中国的圆。我和我的同学都愿意相信这一点。但多年来，看到美国在海外的战争、鲁莽的经济政策和破坏性的党同伐异——最终导致去年对美国国会大厦的一场可耻的攻击——包括我在内的许多中国人几乎看不到那座闪亮的灯塔了。

When we look at America’s enormous pandemic toll, gun violence, political divisions and the attack on the U.S. Capitol, it only reminds Chinese people of our own chaotic past that we have left behind. None of this is meant to gloat over America’s troubles; a strong, stable and responsible United States is good for the world. China still has much to learn from America, and we have a lot in common.
当我们看到美国大流行造成大量死亡、枪支暴力、政治分歧和对美国国会大厦的袭击时，这些只会让中国人想起我们自己抛在身后的混乱过去。这一切都不是对美国的幸灾乐祸。一个强大、稳定和负责任的美国对世界有利。中国还有很多东西要向美国学习，我们有很多共同点

Taiwan is usually treated as a marginalized pawn on the chessboard of the big powers and portrayed as such by the global media. Ms. Pelosi’s trip was a perfect example. 
台湾通常被视为大国棋盘上遭到边缘化的棋子，全球媒体也是这样描绘它的。佩洛西的访问就是一个很好的例子。

Over the years, Seoul has offered to help those living in such basement apartments, providing them with pumps and other equipment to fight floods. It has also renovated sewer systems in low-lying districts to help drain rainwater more quickly.
多年来，首尔一直在主动帮助住在这种地下室公寓里的人，为他们提供水泵和其他防洪设备。政府还对低洼地区的下水道系统进行了改造，以便更快地排水。

They build small dikes with sandbags around their homes. When the floodwater recedes, they put their clothing and furniture in alleyways to dry. 
他们用沙袋在房屋周围筑起小堤坝。洪水退去后，他们把衣服和家具放在巷子里晾干。

when President Yoon Suk-yeol visited the neighbor​hood where the family of three died, their home was still filled with waist-high​ floodwater. Pillows, furniture and plastic bags floated inside. Mr. Yoon had to squat on the street outside to look down into the home through the street-level window.
韩国总统尹锡悦前往死者一家所在的社区时，他们的家仍然被齐腰高的洪水淹没。枕头、家具和塑料袋漂浮在里面。尹锡悦只得蹲在外面的街上，从临街的窗户往房间里看。

When people stop queuing up for visas in front of the U.S. consulates, then the U.S. is in decline.
当美国领事馆前等待签证的队伍不再人头攒动时，才是美国真正衰落之日

Mr. Schumer, who helped spearhead the measure, at one point hinted at the yearslong quest to secure its passage when he noted that it had once been called the Endless Frontier Act — one of a handful of names for the bill as it made its way through Congress. There were ups and downs, and it was a long path to get here
舒默是该法案的推动者之一，他一度暗示该法案可能需要多年的努力才能通过，他指出，该法案曾被称为《无尽前沿法案》，这是在国会审议过程中使用的名称之一。走到这一步的过程很漫长，有许多起起落落

Boasting a direct view of the Chinese city of Xiamen just six miles away, it is built atop an old military bunker, festooned with camouflage netting, and serves hot and cold beverages.
这里可以直接看到10公里外的中国城市厦门，咖啡馆建在一处废弃的军事掩体上，装饰着迷彩网，供应冷热饮料。

He’s always keen to dig a little bit more, to digest specifics, to understand the intent behind a movement or a step, After working together on ‘Reflections,’ it was completely evident to me that Chun Wai had a tremendous work ethic, focus and onstage presence. He’s got this magnetic quality onstage, He can be elegant, very naturally, but he also can be really dynamic. He just draws you in.
他总是热衷于挖掘更多的东西，消化细节，理解一个动作或一个步子背后的意图，在合作《反思》之后，我完全可以看出，镇威有着极高的职业道德、专注力和舞台表现力。他在舞台上极具磁性，他可以很优雅，很自然，也可以很有活力。他就是会吸引着你。

Unless political security is assured, the country will inevitably fall apart, scattering like a box of sand, and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will be out of the question, Hostile forces at home and abroad have never let up for one moment in their strategy to Westernize and split apart our country
如果政治安全得不到保障，国家必然会陷入四分五裂、一盘散沙的局面，中华民族伟大复兴就无从谈起. 国内外敌对势力对我国进行西化和分裂战略一刻也没有松懈过

Don’t simplistically equate ‘nothing has gone wrong’ with ‘nothing will go wrong,’ At every moment always act as if we’re walking on thin ice, as if on the edge of an abyss. In defending national security, nobody is an outsider or a bystander
不能简单地把‘没出事’视同‘没有事’，时时刻刻做到如履薄冰、如临深渊。在维护国家安全上，人人都不是局外人、旁观者

But some American officials say they are realizing that Vietnamese leaders want to straddle the fence with both superpowers.
但有美国官员说，他们渐渐认识到，越南领导人希望在两个大国的对抗中成为一个骑墙派。

We’re maintaining a high state of alert, ready for battle at all times, able to fight at any time, We have the determination and ability to mount a painful direct attack against any invaders who would wreck unification of the motherland, and would show no mercy.
保持全时待战，随时能战的高度戒备状态，我们有决心有能力，对一切破坏祖国的来犯之敌迎头痛击，绝不留情。

Chinese state media covered the exercises breathlessly, and the response from much of Chinese social media was ecstatic.
中国的官方媒体对演习做了连篇累牍的报道，在中国的社交媒体上，人们对此欣喜若狂

We must clearly understand the severe direction of struggle in the Taiwan Strait, Only by really preparing to fight is peace possible. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation won’t be an effortless task achieved just by fanfare of gongs and drums,
要清醒认识台海斗争的严峻形势，只有真正做好‘打’的准备，才有‘和’的可能。中华民族伟大复兴不是轻轻松松、敲锣打鼓就能实现的

I’m about to use four words in a row that I haven’t used in this way before, This isn’t something that came out of the blue
这几个词我从来没有这样连起来用过，这不是无端发生的事

If anyone dares to split off Taiwan, we will not hesitate to fight, will not flinch from the cost and will fight to the very end
如果有人胆敢把台湾分裂出去，我们一定会不惜一战、不惜代价

Patience for visionaries wore thin. Founder-led companies started to seem like liabilities, not assets. It’s surely less fun being a C.E.O. when markets are down, the economy is trending negative and regulation is increasing, If you’re as already rich, famous and successful as these guys, there usually comes a point where staying in the saddle is less appealing than riding off into the sunset.
人们对梦想家的耐心越来越少。由创始人领导的公司如今看起来像是负债，而不是资产。当市场低迷、经济趋于负面、监管不断加强的时候，做首席执行官肯定没那么有趣了，如果你已经像这些人一样富有、有名、成功，那么通常到了一个时刻，纵马向夕阳比留在原地更有吸引力。

In every village in Hainan, there is a communal open-air space, like a square. People would bring their clothes during the day to dry under the burning sun or put the rice out to dry. At night, people would sit there, the guys would take their shirts off, to get cool and to fall asleep.
在海南的每个村庄都有一个公共的露天空间，就像一个广场。白天，人们把衣服拿来，放在烈日下晾晒，或者在这里晒稻谷。晚上大家会坐在那里，男人们会打赤膊，为了凉快、好睡觉。

The overture of “Madama Butterfly” is very fast and energetic, in a minor key, that sounds very Western. I turned the overture upside down. I used the Puccini motif, and I reversed it. I made it quasi-pentatonic, to make it more Eastern. And then I have an opera gong, crash cymbal and all these instruments go along with it. 
《蝴蝶夫人》的序曲非常快，充满活力，以小调谱写，听起来很西方。我对其进行了反转。我使用了普契尼的母题，然后将它反过来。我把它变成了准五声音阶，让它听上去更东方。我还用了京剧里的锣、铙钹等乐器来配合。

There is no catharsis for the people living in the frontline regions. Instead, they seem overwhelmed by the vastness of what is going on around them — as if it’s an existential threat too big for them to do anything about. So they wait numbly for what often seems the inevitable outcome, hypnotized by indecision, all while often forgetting they are directly in harm’s way.
生活在前线地区的人们没有宣泄。他们似乎对周围发生的事情反而感到不知所措——这就像一个巨大的生存威胁，大到让人只能坐以待毙。因此，他们麻木地等待通常看似不可避免的结果到来，在举棋不定中催眠自己，同时经常忘记他们正处于危险之中。

Some of the North Koreans with fever symptoms may have had diseases like whooping cough, measles or typhoid. South Korea ​has ​said that it is impossible for the balloon launches to have brought Covid-19 into the North, saying it had consulted disease-control experts on the issue. O​n Thursday, the South Korean government called Ms. Kim’s accusation “far-fetched” and “very rude.”
一些有发烧症状的朝鲜人可能患的是百日咳、麻疹或伤寒等疾病。韩国表示，不可能通过发送气球将新冠带入朝鲜，并表示已就此问题咨询了疾病控制专家。周四，韩国政府称金与正的指控“牵强”和“非常无礼”。

But the Afghan forces were already beginning to buckle. By the end of the summer, the insurgents had seized dozens of districts, rapidly sweeping across the countryside as outpost after outpost folded. President Ashraf Ghani had reshuffled his military leadership, and militia units led by the powerful and notorious warlords of Afghanistan’s past had taken up arms to defend their economic fiefs.
但是阿富汗军队已经开始屈服。到夏天结束时，叛乱分子已占领了数十个地区，随着一个又一个前哨沦陷，他们迅速席卷了整个乡村。阿富汗总统阿什拉夫·加尼改组了军事领导层，让昔日那些强大而臭名昭著的军阀领导的民兵部队拿起武器，捍卫自己的经济领地。

Addressing a predominantly Chinese American group of about 40 people, Dr. Au, a practicing anesthesiologist, delicately alluded to “the shootings that took place in metro Atlanta on March 16 of 2021” as she launched into a plea for new gun-control laws that Georgia Republicans oppose. 
执业麻醉师欧晓瑜在向一个大约40人的华裔美国人群体发表讲话，呼吁制定遭到佐治亚州共和党人反对的新的枪支管制法时，小心翼翼地提到了“2021年3月16日在亚特兰大都会区发生的枪击事件”。

Dr. Au’s district — a well-paved tangle of shopping centers and office complexes where law firms list their names in Korean and Indian grocers compete for space with bubble tea chains — is a case study in the social and political complexity of an electoral force rising in swing states: the diverse collection of communities jammed into the census label “Asian American.”
在欧晓瑜所在的选区，路面整洁，购物中心和办公楼林立，律师事务所的名字用的是韩文，印度超市与珍珠奶茶连锁店争夺空间。聚集在人口普查标签“亚裔美国人”下的多样化群体正成为一股上升的选举势力，而该选区可以被看作这股势力在摇摆州产生的社会和政治复杂性的一个研究案例。

At checkpoints along the streets, morality police chastise women who are not covered from head to toe in all-concealing burqas and headpieces in public. A year into Taliban rule, Afghanistan has seemed to hurtle backward in time. 
在街道沿线的检查站，道德警察在公共场合严惩那些没有用罩袍和头巾从头到脚遮盖全身的女性。塔利班统治一年后，阿富汗似乎穿梭到了过去。

Music had been banned, Mr. Akif said, “because our Prophet says listening to music develops hypocrisy in the human heart.” The Taliban’s initial pledge to open secondary schools for girls nationwide had been viewed by the international community as an important indicator of the Taliban government’s willingness to moderate. 
音乐被禁止了，阿基夫说：“因为我们的先知说听音乐会在人心中滋生虚伪。” 塔利班最初承诺在全国开设女子中学，被国际社会视为塔利班政府温和意愿的重要标志。

The mortgage rebellions have roiled a property market facing the fallout from a decades-long housing bubble. So far, the government has scrambled to limit the attention garnered by the boycotts. 
集体停贷已搅乱了房地产市场，该行业正面临着几十年房地产泡沫的后果。到目前为止，政府一直在努力减少停还房贷引发的关注。

China started to crack down on excessive borrowing by developers. The move created a cash crunch for many firms that had relied on easy access to debt to keep construction projects humming. As financial strain deepened, Evergrande and other large property developers spiraled into default, and the impact rippled across the industry.
中国开始打击开发商的过度借贷。此举让许多依靠轻而易举获得的贷款来维持建设项目的公司出现了现金断流问题。随着财务压力的增加，恒大和其他大房地产开发商陷入了违约，影响已波及整个行业。

Homeowners of a partly built apartment complex in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou compared themselves to Rickshaw Boy, or Camel Xiangzhi, a tragic character in Chinese literature whose dream — a rickshaw of his own — is thwarted by corruption and dishonesty.
中部城市郑州一个已部分建成的楼盘的业主将自己比作骆驼祥子，中国文学中的这个悲剧人物曾梦想拥有自己的黄包车，但腐败和欺骗阻挠了梦想的实现。

We, as thousands of Xiangzis, must throw away those shackles, and let those who robbed us of money and smashed our cars know that Xiangzi is no longer the lamb who is slaughtered by others,
我们万千祥子，要丢掉那些枷锁，让抢我们钱，砸我们车的人知道，祥子不再是那个任人宰割的羔羊

Even if Chinese authorities provide developers with enough capital, the underlying homes are still overvalued, There has been all this fictitious wealth that has been created by surging real estate prices that is just not justified
即使中国当局为开发商提供足够的资金，基本的问题仍是房子的估值过高，房地产价格不合理的飙升创造了所有这些虚假的财富

China’s social credit system punishes infractions, When we feel desperate, the credit system is a paper tiger for us, a shackle that can be thrown into the trash at any time. 
中国用社会信用体系来惩罚违信行为，当我们的生存都是问题的时候，当我们感到绝望的时候，征信对于我们来说，也就是一个纸老虎，一个可以随时丢到垃圾桶的枷锁

But from where I’m standing, ultimate blame lies with the Western-dominated neoliberal system that keeps developing countries in a form of debt-fueled colonization. The system is in crisis, its shaky foundations exposed by the tumbling dominoes of the Ukraine war, resulting in food and fuel scarcity, the pandemic and looming insolvency and hunger rippling across the world.
但在我看来，最终的责任在于西方主导的新自由主义体系，它使发展中国家处于一种债务驱动的殖民形式。该体系正处于危机之中，其摇摇欲坠的基座被乌克兰战争的多米诺骨牌所暴露，导致粮食和燃料短缺、疫情肆虐，以及迫在眉睫的破产和饥饿在世界各地蔓延

This unsustainable economy was always going to collapse. But we are just the canary in the coal mine. The entire world is plugged into this failing system, and the pain will be widespread. The rupee has lost almost half its value since March, and many goods are out of stock. 
这种不可持续的经济总是要崩溃的。但我们只是危险的预兆。整个世界都与这个失败的体系紧密相连，痛苦将是广泛的。自今年3月以来，卢比贬值了近一半，许多商品缺货。

There is no silver bullet that can transform the nature of the Iranian regime or the U.S.-Iran relationship. Robert Cooper, a decorated European diplomat who negotiated with Iran, urges strategic patience. 
没有灵丹妙药可以改变伊朗政权的性质或美伊关系。知名欧洲外交官罗伯特·库珀曾参与伊朗谈判，他敦促保持战略耐心。

For many, defending Mr. Rushdie and “The Satanic Verses” against his would-be assassins may be easy, But “nobody is saying that,” she said. Instead, “people are paying lip service to free speech.”
对很多人来说，为拉什迪和《撒旦诗篇》辩护可能很容易。但是“没有人这么说，”她说。相反，“人们只是在口头上支持言论自由。”

In the bustling open kitchen of Good to Eat Dumplings, the chef Tony Tung makes long, evenly stretched, generously filled Taiwanese dumplings. The bottoms are crunchy and golden, and the filling is unembellished but irresistible — a juicy mix of pork, shrimp and shredded cabbage, lightly perfumed with scallions and sesame oil.
在Good to Eat Dumplings餐厅忙碌的开放式厨房里，大厨托尼·董（音）正在制作把面抻成长条形的大馅台湾锅贴。锅贴松脆的底部呈金黄色，馅料普通却让人无法抗拒——有猪肉、有虾，还有卷心菜丝，嫩滑多汁不说，还散发着葱花和芝麻油的淡淡香味。

Ms. Tung’s cooking is bright, delicate and constantly changing to include dishes like pickled bitter melon and opo squash leaves with sesame paste. “Beef noodle soup, stinky tofu — people know those dishes,”
董女士做的菜色泽鲜艳、精致，而且富于变化，菜式包括凉拌苦瓜和麻酱拌瓠瓜叶等。“大家都知道牛肉面、臭豆腐，”

Humans were not the only ones oppressed by the heat. Pandas in zoos lay on sheets of melting ice. Pigs being transported by truck in the southwestern city of Chongqing became dehydrated, prompting firefighters to hose them down. Chickens rejected their feed and struggled to lay eggs in the heat, causing the egg prices to surge across the country, according to state media reports.
人类并不是唯一受酷暑折磨的动物。动物园里的熊猫躺在融化的冰块上。在重庆，卡车上运的猪由于高温出现了脱水，导致消防队员用管子给它们冲洗。据官媒报道，高温下，鸡拒绝吃饲料，下蛋也少了，导致全国各地的鸡蛋价格上升。

Strictly speaking, it is not completely correct to call such a system corruption. Corruption entails a deviation from the norm, whereas in Mr. Putin’s Russia the norm is precisely that of officials living on money of dubious origin. If the law were to be followed literally, then practically every Russian minister or governor could end up in prison. But corruption is the glue that holds the system together, not the catalyst to bring it down.
严格来说，将这样的系统称为腐败并不完全正确。腐败必然背离规范，而在普京的俄罗斯，官员靠来路不明的钱生活恰恰是规范。真要一板一眼地按法律行事，几乎每个俄罗斯部长或州长都可能最终入狱。但腐败是将体制维系在一起的粘合剂，而不是破坏体制的催化剂。

Mr. Trump embodied Louis XIV’s phrase “L’état, c’est moi,” or “I am the state,” his own advisers and several outside observers said.
据他的顾问和几位外部观察人士说，特朗普践行了路易十四的“朕即国家”这句话。

They sneak down darkened alleys to set explosives. They identify Russian targets for Ukrainian artillery and long-range rockets provided by the United States. They blow up rail lines and assassinate officials they consider collaborators with the Russians. Slipping back and forth across the front lines, the guerrilla fighters are known in Ukraine as partisans
他们潜入阴暗的巷道安放炸药。他们为乌克兰的火炮和美国提供的远程火箭炮识别俄军目标。他们炸断铁路，刺杀他们认为在通俄的官员。这些游走于前线两边的战斗人员在乌克兰被称为“游击队”

No one else writes “thrillers” as languid as Lawrence Osborne’s. His novels tend to be leisurely, slow-burn mysteries that could be mistaken for impeccably observed travel memoirs, except for the fact that usually there’s a dead body that needs hiding, finding or explaining. 
没有人写出像劳伦斯·奥斯本的那样闲适的“惊悚小说”。他的小说往往是悠闲、缓慢的谜团，可能会被误认为是精心准备的旅行回忆录，除了通常有一具尸体需要隐藏、寻找或解释。

There was a rippling electricity in the air waves; the herd spooked by the approach of wolves who have not yet been seen but whose tremendous and alien scent is on the wind.
电波的涟漪传向四面八方；牧群被即将到来的狼群吓坏了，狼还没出现，但无处不在的陌生气味在风中飘荡。

Adrian Gyle (spell that last name differently and it speaks volumes), the novel’s narrator, is a world-weary British journalist nearing the end of a not especially distinguished career. 
小说的叙述者阿德里安·盖尔（Adrian Gyle，这个姓氏的拼写改变一下，能说明很多问题）是一位厌世的英国记者，没有多少建树的职业生涯正接近尾声。

Charlie Chasen and Michael Malone met in Atlanta in 1997, when Mr. Malone served as a guest singer in Mr. Chasen’s band. They quickly became friends, but they didn’t notice what other people around them did: The two men could pass for twins. Mr. Malone and Mr. Chasen are doppelgängers. They look strikingly similar, but they are not related.
查理·蔡森和迈克尔·马龙于1997年在亚特兰大相识，当时马龙在蔡森的乐队中担任客座歌手。他们很快成为了朋友，但他们没有注意到周围的人是如何看待他们的：这两个男人看上去完全可以是双胞胎。马龙和蔡森是所谓的“二重身”——他们的相貌惊人地相似，却没有血缘关系。

China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, a dapper man in well-pressed suits, keeps up a relentless travel schedule, more than 30 countries so far this year, to places big and small: island nations in the Pacific, Central Asia on China’s western periphery and, often, Africa.
中国外交部长王毅有繁忙的外访日程，今年到目前为止，这名西装革履、衣冠楚楚的男子已去过大大小小30多个国家：从太平洋岛国到中国西部边陲外的中亚国家，还有他频繁到访的非洲国家。

A dispute with military leaders compounded Mr. Khan’s struggles, and by late last year, his tenure began to unwind. He had sought to place a loyal aide and former spy chief in charge of the army over the objections of the military leadership. Mr. Khan’s scorched-earth politics had left him with few friends and little negotiating room. 
与军方领导人的争执加剧了汗的困境，到去年年底，他的地位已经摇摇欲坠。他曾不顾军方领导层的反对，试图让一名忠诚的助手和前间谍头子掌管军队。汗的焦土政治让他几乎没有朋友，谈判空间也很小。

A lot of movies I was looking forward to watching could not be released in theaters, I personally think that the addition of these ‘special endings’ is still acceptable, though just barely.
经历了许多部自己期待的电影不能上院线之后，比起被删减和不上映，个人觉得‘增加特供版结局’勉强在可接受的范围内。

A five-judge federal court panel, headed by the nation’s chief justice, unanimously upheld Mr. Najib’s conviction on seven corruption counts after finding that his appeal was “devoid of any merits.”
由国家首席大法官领导的五名法官组成的联邦法院小组在发现纳吉布的上诉“毫无根据”后，一致维持对纳吉布七项腐败罪名的宣判。

Mr. Najib has cast himself as a victim and blamed the elusive financier Jho Low, who helped siphon money from 1MDB and used his share to give extravagant gifts of jewelry and paintings to newfound celebrity friends. He remains a fugitive and is believed to be in China.
纳吉布将自己视为受害者，并指责诡秘莫测的金融家刘特佐(Jho Low)帮助从1MDB吸走资金，并用他的份额向新结识的名人朋友赠送珠宝和名画等奢侈礼物。刘特佐依然在逃，据信在中国。
