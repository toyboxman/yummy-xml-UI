This was Mr. Gorbachev’s double renunciation, and of course what Putin is doing today is precisely the contrary, Gorbachev detonated something he could not control. He made history but he did not know what history he was making.  
这是戈尔巴乔夫的双重舍弃，当然，今天普京的所作所为则恰恰相反，戈尔巴乔夫引爆了他无法控制的东西。他创造了历史，但他当时并不知道自己正在创造什么样的历史。

Mr. Gorbachev was weak; the only way to modernize was through authoritarian reform backed by force. He was a man of peace, although bitter at the end of his life, who willed the end to the Cold War and reduced the risk of nuclear confrontation  
戈尔巴乔夫太软弱；实现现代化的唯一途径是以武力为后盾的威权改革。他是一个和平之人，虽然晚年满腹牢骚，但他愿意结束冷战，并降低核对抗的风险。

For Mr. Putin, the end of the Soviet Union was the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,” The disaster was caused, in Mr. Putin’s telling, by the weak nerves of a leader too willing to bend to the demands of a treacherous and duplicitous West  
对普京来说，苏联解体是“上个世纪最大的地缘政治灾难”，按照普京的说法，这场灾难是一名气魄不足的领导人造成的，他太愿意屈从于奸诈且别有用心的西方的要求

The paralysis of power and will is the first step toward complete degradation and oblivion, We lost confidence for only one moment, but it was enough to disrupt the balance of forces in the world.  
控制力和意志的瘫痪是走向彻底毁灭和湮没的第一步，我们失去信心只是一瞬间，但这足以扰乱世界力量的平衡。

Monkeypox patients have turned up with what looked like mosquito bites, pimples or ingrown hairs, not the large pustules usually associated with the infection. Some did not even have visible lesions but felt excruciating pain when swallowing, urinating or emptying their bowels. Some had headaches or depression, confusion and seizures. Others had severe eye infections or inflammation of the heart muscle.
猴痘患者出现的症状与蚊虫叮咬、丘疹或毛发内生相似，并不像通常与感染相关的大脓疱。有些人甚至没有明显病变，但会在吞咽、排尿或排便时感到剧痛。一些人会出现头痛或抑郁、思维混乱和癫痫等症状。还有一些人则出现了严重的眼部感染或心肌炎。

For patients, outdated case definitions and guidance can have serious implications. Cameron French, 30, was exposed to the virus on July 6. Two weeks later, he developed a sore throat, head and body aches, painful urination and three bumps — on his face, a thigh and an elbow.  
对患者而言，滞后的病例定义和诊断指导可能会带来严重后果。30岁的卡梅伦·弗伦奇在7月6日接触到了猴痘病毒。两周后，他出现喉咙痛、头部和身体疼痛、尿痛的现象，且有三处肿包，分别在脸部、大腿和肘部

Finally, all it took was one quiet word from Gorbachev to declare the dissolution of the Soviet Communist Party, and a great party was gone, In the end nobody was a real man. Nobody came out to resist.  
最后戈尔巴乔夫轻轻一句话，宣布苏联共产党解散，偌大一个党就没了，最后竟无一人是男儿，没什么人出来抗争。

China has long been the world’s factory floor for high-tech electronics, unrivaled in its ability to secure legions of high-skilled workers and the production capacity to handle demand for the next hot device. But American companies are seeing more risk there — a perspective forged during the Trump-era trade war, with its tit-for-tat tariffs, and cemented by China’s saber-rattling after Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan last month. 
中国长期以来一直是全球高科技电子产品的制造国，提供大量高技能工人的能力和满足新一代抢手设备需求的产能无与伦比。但美国企业在中国看到了越来越多的风险——这是在特朗普时代贸易战针锋相对的关税战中形成的观点，而后又被众议院议长佩洛西上个月访台后中国剑拔弩张的姿态所强化。

Early on the morning of Sept. 2, 1945, Gen. Douglas MacArthur boarded the battleship U.S.S. Missouri to preside over the ceremony marking the Japanese surrender in World War II. Among the representatives of the nine Allied nations was a group of defeated colonial officials. 
1945年9月2日清晨，道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟将军登上美国“密苏里号”战舰主持“二战”日本投降仪式。在九个同盟国的代表中，有一群战败的殖民官员。

At a small Korean convenience store, there would normally be North Korean beer or dried vegetables, said the owner, who gave only her surname, Zhou. But the supply had dried up since the borders closed. As for the rest of the goods — a colorful array of South Korean instant noodles and bottled drinks — there was little demand
一位只透露自己姓周的店主说，在她经营的小型韩国商品便利店，通常会供应朝鲜啤酒或脱水蔬菜。但自从边境关闭以来，货源已经枯竭。而其余的商品——五颜六色的韩国方便面和瓶装饮料——的需求又很少

Western countries led by the United States don’t want to see the emergence of a powerful China, The struggle between the two social systems and two ideologies will be long-lasting, complicated, arduous and severe.
以美国为首的西方国家不愿意看到一个强大中国的出现，两种社会制度、两种意识形态的斗争也将是长期的、复杂的、艰巨的、严峻的。

If there was no camera, if there was no netizen who posted the video online, if there was no release of the video, would no one care about this matter and the girl would have been beaten for nothing
如果没有摄像头，如果没有这个网友，如果不公布视频，这个事情是不是就不会有人在意，女孩子就这样白白挨打

When your heart isn’t strong, no matter how big you are, you’re not really strong, He urged them to hurry and make tech breakthroughs to contribute to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
心脏不强，体量再大也不算强。他敦促大家抓紧时间，取得技术突破，为中华民族的复兴做出贡献。

Any government considering a push for self-reliance in semiconductors needs to face the harsh reality, Semiconductors represent the highest form of human engineering achievement. They are the most difficult thing we create as a species. How can one country ‘win it all’ by itself?
任何考虑推动半导体行业自力更生的政府都需要面对残酷的现实，半导体代表了人类工程成就的最高形式。它们是我们作为一个物种创造的最困难的东西。一个国家怎么能靠自己来‘包揽一切’呢？

The U.S. Navy said that its ships did not sail through any territorial waters while transiting the Taiwan Strait and that the passage was meant to uphold the freedom to navigate the high seas. These ships transited through a corridor in the strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal state
美国海军表示，巡洋舰在通过台湾海峡时没有驶过任何领海，该过航旨在维护公海航行自由。巡洋舰仅驶过海峡中的一条走廊，该走廊不属于任何沿海国的领海

We gritted our teeth and got through crisis after crisis. I hope they’ll learn from its resilient nature and stay grounded and not run away from difficulty.
我们咬紧牙关，度过了一次又一次的危机。我希望他们能从木头的韧性中学习，保持脚踏实地，不要逃避困难。

During the day, the brain’s pea-sized pineal gland remains inactive. A few hours before our natural sleep time, as it starts to get dark outside and the light entering our retina fades, the gland switches on to flood the brain with melatonin. Instead of a lights-out trigger, melatonin acts more like a dimmer switch, turning the day functions off and switching night functions on. 
白天，人脑中豌豆大小的松果体处于不活跃状态。在自然睡眠时间的前几个小时，天色开始变黑，进入视网膜的光线逐渐减弱，松果体就会开始分泌大量褪黑素。与其说是熄灯按钮，不如说褪黑素更像一个灯光调暗器，关闭了白天功能，打开了夜间功能。

Most articles on the death of Mikhail Gorbachev dwell on the political failure of his reform project. Nowadays everyone views the old Soviet Union, with its centrally planned economy, as an abject failure. But it didn’t always look that way.
关于戈尔巴乔夫去世的文章大多都在谈论他的改革计划在政治上的失败。如今人人都将实施中央计划经济的前苏联视为彻头彻尾的失败。但事实并非总是如此。

Nor was this a statistical mirage. If nothing else, Soviet performance during World War II demonstrated that its industrial growth under Joseph Stalin had been very real. After 1970, however, the Soviet growth story fell apart, and by some measures technological progress came to a standstill.
这也不是统计上的海市蜃楼。不说别的，苏联在“二战”中的表现证明其在斯大林治下的工业增长绝对是真实的。然而在1970年之后，苏联的增长故事土崩瓦解，技术的进步在某种程度上陷入了停滞。

There’s a big silent majority that just wants to sit on the fence, They don’t really want to take a side because it could hurt their interests either way.
有很大一部分沉默的人只想保持中立，他们真的不想站队，因为这可能会损害他们的利益

The message is constantly about these labs, and that will erode confidence in that infrastructure and the work that’s being performed. Experts say Russia is likely to use the mere existence of the investigative session, much of which will take place behind closed doors, to give its claims a patina of legitimacy.
总是散发关于这些实验室的信息，这将削弱人们对这方面的基础设施和进行中的研究的信心，专家们说，俄罗斯可能只是要利用举行调查会议，来给其谎言披上一层合法的外衣。大多数调查会议将闭门进行。

Kyle Mullen always had the natural drive and talent that made success look easy. Until he tried out for the Navy SEALs. But by the middle of the course’s third week — a continual gut punch of physical and mental hardship, sleep deprivation and hypothermia that the SEALs call Hell Week — the 6-foot-4 athlete from Manalapan, New Jersey, was dead-eyed with exhaustion, riddled with infection and coughing up blood from lungs that were so full of fluid that others who were there said later that he sounded like he was gargling.
凯尔·穆伦身上总有一股天生的劲头和才华，看起来非常容易成功。直到他参加了海豹突击队的选拔。但在课程进行到第三周时——这一周因要持续承受身心打击、睡眠不足和体温过低而被海豹突击队称为“地狱周”——这位身高1米93、来自新泽西州马纳拉潘镇的运动员筋疲力尽，全身感染，他肺部充满液体，不断咳血，据当时在场的人后来说，他咳得听上去就像在漱口一样

That first day, the instructors put candidates through a gantlet of running, crawling, situps and pushups on the hot sand with no breaks, Mullen’s mother said. Late in the afternoon, the men were racing in teams, carrying 170-pound inflatable boats over their heads, when Mullen passed out. He called his mother from an ambulance a short time later and explained that he had not had a drop of water all day.
穆伦的母亲说，教官们在课程第一天就让候选人在滚烫的沙滩上饱受跑步、爬行、仰卧起坐和俯卧撑的折磨，还不准他们休息。当天下午晚些时候，这些男性还要头顶77公斤重的充气艇分组赛跑，而穆伦正是在那时昏迷了过去。昏迷后不久，穆伦在救护车上给母亲打了电话，解释说他一整天都没喝过一滴水。

Still, many young people think ting ju feng is just a social media fad. Probably it will soon be gone, Not everybody is fond of the old cadre vibe. The profession is being looked up to as if it has a halo on it now, If anybody who is not a civil servant deliberately dresses like this in daily life, I would think he is a bit too uptight and stern.
尽管如此，许多年轻人认为“厅局风”只是社交媒体上的短暂狂热。也许过一阵就不流行了，并不是所有人都喜欢老干部风格。公务员这个专业已经自带光环了，但是日常生活中刻意追求这种穿搭，我会觉得这个人有点古板严肃。

I recently learned about this term called ‘quiet quitting’ where you’re not outright quitting your job, but you’re quitting the idea of going above and beyond, You are still performing your duties, but you are no longer subscribing to the hustle culture mentally that work has to be our life. when I heard about quiet quitting was, ‘Oh God, that’s me. It’s been something I’ve been practicing, but I didn’t have a name for it up until now.
我最近了解到一个叫做‘躺平’(quiet quitting)的说法，它的意思是，虽然没有直接离职，但放弃了努力进取的想法，你仍在履行职责，但你心里不再认同工作就是生活的全部这种奋斗文化。当我听说躺平时，”她说她的第一反应是，“天哪，说的就是我。这是我一直在实践的事情，但直到现在我才知道它有这样一个名字。

By her own admission, Ms. Truss has little of Mr. Johnson’s charisma. Awkward where he is easygoing, staccato where he is smooth, she nevertheless scaled the party’s ranks with what colleagues describe as nerve, drive and an appetite for disruptive politics. 
特拉斯自己也承认，她基本没有约翰逊那样的魅力。约翰逊随和，她却显得笨拙；约翰逊圆滑，她却显得迟疑，尽管如此，她还是凭借同僚口中的勇气、决心和对颠覆式政治的渴望在党内步步高升。

Wooden in public, Ms. Truss is fun in private, friends say, with a direct, informal manner, a weakness for karaoke and an unabashed love for the pop star Taylor Swift. Her particular skill was not to master a brief or be glib or facile, but to come up with something unexpected, Every piece of work she came up with was provocative. She revels in controversy and provoking people.
友人们都说，特拉斯在公开场合比较木讷，但私下里十分有趣，直截了当、不拘小节，喜欢唱卡拉OK，并且毫不掩饰对流行歌星泰勒·斯威夫特的热爱。她的特殊能力不在于掌握一份简报或是巧舌如簧，而在于能出人意料, 她拿出的每一件作品都很有挑衅性。她喜欢制造争议并且挑衅别人。

Wealthy and powerful entrepreneurs in China were once idolized by the public, doted on by the government and courted by foreign investors. Clearly, the writing is on the wall for these company founders.
有钱有势的企业家在中国曾经受到公众的崇拜、政府的青睐和外国投资者的追捧。显然，对于这些公司创始人来说，答案已经很明确。

The husband-and-wife couple had personified the Chinese economy’s broader rags-to-riches rise. They started their real estate business on Hainan Island in southernmost China, a place with a reputation even by China’s standards for having vertiginous booms and busts in apartment prices. 
这对夫妻象征着更广泛层面上的中国经济中那些白手起家者的经历。他们的房地产业务始于中国最南端的海南岛，即便按照中国的标准，这个地方的标准房价也以剧烈动荡而闻名。

Many real estate developers erected rectangular boxes with architectural palettes often limited to garish choices for the color of the glass and eccentric rooftops in poor mimicry of European manor houses.
许多房地产开发商盖的房子都是方方正正的，其建筑设计元素通常仅限于用有色玻璃装饰，以及对欧式庄园屋顶的拙劣模仿。

The supply chains that have stretched around the world in recent decades are studies in modern efficiency, whizzing products like electronics, chemicals, couches and food across continents and oceans at ever-cheaper costs. But those networks proved fragile, The drought in southwestern China has also had ripple effects for global businesses.
最近几十年里延伸到世界各地的供应链是现代效率的典范，电子器件、化学制品、沙发和食品等产品快速跨越大洲和海洋，成本越来越低。但这些供应链网络被证明是脆弱的，中国西南地区的干旱也给全球企业带来了连锁反应。

The heat and drought have wilted many of the vegetables in southwestern China, causing prices to nearly double, and have made it hard for the surviving pigs and poultry to put on weight, driving up meat prices. ‌
高温和干旱使中国西南地区菜田里的许多蔬菜枯萎，导致蔬菜价格上涨了近一倍，也使猪和家禽的饲料不足，推高了肉价。 ‌

In a 2018 report, the W.T.O. pointed out that the global food trade was particularly vulnerable to disruptions in transportation that might occur as a result of climate change, like rising sea levels threatening ports or extreme weather degrading roads and bridges. More than half of globally traded grains pass through at least one of 14 global “choke points,” including the Panama Canal, the Strait of Malacca or the Black Sea rail network, the report said.
世贸组织在2018年的一份报告中指出，全球粮食贸易尤其易受气候变化可能导致的运输中断的影响，比如海平面上升给港口带来威胁，或极端天气给道路和桥梁造成破坏。报告说，全球超过一半的谷物贸易需要经过全球14个“咽喉要道”中的至少一个，包括巴拿马运河、马六甲海峡或黑海铁路网。

Indeed, companies talking about reshoring production often make the point that modern techniques in some cases allow them to produce with relatively few workers, in which case the cost savings from outsourcing to low-wage countries are minimal — and are outweighed by the logistical advantages of producing close to home.
当然，正在考虑生产回流的企业往往会指出，在某些情况下，现代技术允许企业用相对较少的工人进行生产，此时外包给低薪国家生产节省的成本微乎其微，而在距离本国更近的地方生产的物流优势就更大了。

Never, perhaps, has an heir been more ready for the crown. Having aged from an awkward, self-doubting young man into an unhappy middle-aged husband, Charles has become, at 73, a self-assured, gray-haired eminence, steeped in causes like climate change and environmental protection, which were once quirky but now seem peculiarly in sync with the times.
大概没有哪位继承人对加冕有这么充分的准备了。 从局促笨拙而又自我怀疑的青年，到婚姻不快乐的中年，如今73岁的查尔斯已成为一位镇定自若、头发花白的尊贵人物，他投身于气候变化和环境保护等事业，这些曾经显得古怪的举动，如今看来却出奇地与时俱进。

As King Charles III, he will become sovereign of the world’s most important constitutional monarchy, head of the most storied royal family, and a symbol of continuity in a storm-tossed country. Charles’s journey was, perhaps inevitably, less acclaimed. His foibles and frustrations were mercilessly dissected by the news media; his pet hobbies, from architecture criticism to organic farming, were frequently mocked
作为查尔斯三世，他将成为世界上最重要的君主立宪制国家的君主，历史上最负盛名的王族的族长，同时也将是在国家风雨飘摇之中传承的象征。或许是命中注定，查尔斯的经历并不是那样广受赞颂。新闻媒体皆在无情剖析他的缺点与挫折；从建筑评论到有机农业，他的爱好经常遭到嘲讽

For Charles, the biggest personal challenge may be healing the rift with his son. Charles must also deal with the legal fallout from his brother Andrew’s relationship with Mr. Epstein. He has grown in stature in recent years, He’s looking like a much more confident character, happier in his own skin.
对查尔斯来说，个人最大的挑战可能是弥合与儿子之间的裂痕。查尔斯还必须处理弟弟安德鲁与爱泼斯坦的关系带来的法律后果。近年来，他的声望有所提高，他看起来像一个更自信的角色，更加游刃有余。
