Predicting the path of the pandemic has always been difficult. Even in places like Britain with reliable data, forecasts have often been far off the mark. The country has said it will only count those who die from respiratory failure directly linked to an infection, leaving out vast numbers who died because Covid aggravated underlying diseases or caused heart or liver failure. But scientists have generally used reported Covid deaths as a dependable barometer to determine the potential size of an outbreak.
预测疫情传播路径一直很困难。即使在英国这样有可靠数据的地方，预测结果也常与实际相去甚远。该国表示，将只统计感染直接导致的呼吸衰竭死亡病例，不会包括大量因新冠导致基础疾病加重或心脏肝脏衰竭的死亡。但科学家通常将报告的新冠死亡数视为可靠标尺，来确定疫情的潜在规模。

The plateau is close to “Chicken’s Neck,” a narrow corridor of Indian territory that connects mainland India to its northeastern states, an area the size of Oregon, where 45 million people live. A few years later, the most lethal confrontation on the disputed border occurred in the northern Ladakh region in June 2020 when Chinese soldiers killed at least 20 Indian soldiers with wooden staves and nail-studded clubs
洞朗高原靠近“鸡脖子”，也就是印度领土上连接印度本土及其东北部各邦的一条狭窄走廊，后者面积相当于俄勒冈州，居住着4500万人口。几年后，北部拉达克地区在2020年6月发生了该争议边界上最致命的对抗，当时中国士兵用木棍和狼牙棒打死了至少20名印度士兵

Within India, Mr. Modi’s strongman image has taken a dent from the confrontation with China. His insistence that India has not lost territory to China provides ammunition to his supporters, but the numbers of his blind supporters have dwindled. 
在印度国内，莫迪的强人形象因与中国的对抗而被削弱。他坚称印度没有将领土拱手让给中国，从而为他的支持者提供依据，但不假思索地选择支持他的人在减少。

Casino gambling gave immigrants in low-wage jobs a “false sense of accomplishment.” Even as many of the people surveyed said they had borrowed money from friends or loan sharks to keep gambling, they also said casinos were the only entertainment option accessible to them.
赌场赌博给从事底薪工作的移民一种“虚假的成就感”。尽管许多受访者说，他们曾向朋友或高利贷借钱继续赌博，但他们也表示，赌场是他们唯一可以得到的娱乐方式。

Mr. McCarthy himself sought to make the conflict about something bigger than himself in an appeal to his opponents to put aside whatever feelings they had about him so Republicans could move forward. But the holdouts were not yet budging.
麦卡锡本人试图强调这并非一场关于他的冲突，希望这能打动反对的人，让他们搁置对他的不满，帮助共和党向前推进。但是反对者不为所动。

The national exam is an annual rite for young Chinese, some of whom spend thousands of dollars for prep classes and many hours cramming for it. It comes at a fraught time. It was supposed to be given in early December, then was canceled at the last minute. Jobs in China’s vast Civil Service have long been considered prestigious launching pads for a career. But these days the jobs are also coveted out of necessity, because it’s especially hard for new graduates to find employment at private companies.
对许多中国年轻人来说，国考是一年一度的大事情，有的人花不少钱参加备考班，花很多时间来突击准备。而现在是一个令人忧虑的时刻。原定于12月初举行的考试在最后一刻取消了。中国的公务员是一支庞大的队伍，长期以来，公务员一直被视为职业生涯中备受仰视的跳板。但如今公务员职位令人垂涎也是出于必然，因为应届毕业生在民营企业找工作越来越难。

The competition for public service positions is so fierce that people often refer to them with a Chinese saying: “thousands of troops crossing a single-plank bridge.” The exam is rigorous. Then there’s the reality of Civil Service work. Some say their days are ruled by rigid hierarchies and involve monotonous chores. Others, while saying they enjoy their jobs, complain that their responsibilities often sprawl beyond normal work hours.
公务员岗位竞争激烈，人们常将其形容为“千军万马过独木桥”。这是一个严格的考试。然后是公务员工作的现实。有人说他们的日子被严格的等级制度所统治，做的是单调的杂事。也有人说他们喜欢自己的工作，但抱怨经常要加班加点。

Walls are plastered not with “help wanted” signs, but with notices from entrepreneurs putting their businesses up for sale. Roads and alleys once packed with migrant workers are now mostly empty. Now, faced with an unpredictable — and uncontrolled — epidemic and financial uncertainty, people and companies are spending cautiously, suggesting that the road to recovery will be uneven and painful.
街道两旁的商店和作坊关闭了。墙上贴的不是招聘启示，而是店面出售的通知。曾经挤满外来务工者的马路和小巷现在大多空无一人。现在，面对难以预测且不受控制的疫情以及金融的不确定性，个人和企业都在支出方面保持谨慎，这表明复苏之路将是崎岖且痛苦的。

The spending boom is also set to reduce, though not erase, U.S. reliance on Asia for other kinds of chips. The chip-making boom is expected to create a jobs bonanza of 40,000 new roles in factories and companies that supply them, And a severe shortage in skills may undercut the boom
投资热潮也将降低（但不会消除）美国在其他类型芯片上对亚洲的依赖。芯片制造投资热潮有望在供应这些芯片的工厂和公司中创造4万个新职位。这方面技能的严重短缺可能会削弱投资

Since training efforts may take years to bear fruit, industry executives want to make it easier for highly educated foreign workers to obtain visas to work in the United States. Officials in Washington are aware that comments encouraging more immigration could invite political fire.
由于培训工作可能需要数年时间才能见效，行业高管希望政府让受过高等教育的外国工人更容易获得在美国工作的签证，华盛顿的官员意识到，鼓励更多移民的说法可能会在政治上引火烧身。

We firmly oppose the practice of manipulating Covid prevention and control measures to achieve political goals, and will take corresponding measures in accordance with the principle of reciprocity according to different situations, She did not elaborate.
我们对试图操弄疫情防控措施以达到政治目的的做法表示坚决反对，将针对不同情况本着对等原则采取相应措施。她没有详细说明。

The government in December dismantled a sprawling testing apparatus that required residents to test regularly, and scrapped its strategy of lockdowns and grueling quarantine that applied not just to those who tested positive but also their contacts. But some European countries have begun putting in place restrictions for visitors from China without waiting for E.U. guidance.
去年12月，政府取消了定期的大规模核酸检测要求，以及对阳性患者和密接的封锁和严格隔离政策。但一些欧洲国家没有等待欧盟的指南，已经开始对来自中国的游客实施限制。

For three years, Western media coverage has treated the Covid situation in China like a spectacle, an opportunity to gawk at the toxic cesspool contained in self-imposed isolation across the ocean. And the introduction of stringent requirements for travelers can be logistically cumbersome, discriminatory and politically toxic.
三年来，西方媒体的报道一直把中国的新冠疫情当作一场奇观对待，一个对大洋彼岸自我孤立的有毒渊薮瞠目结舌的机会。对旅行者提出严格的要求可能会造成旅程管理上的麻烦，具有歧视性，并且会成为政治毒药。

For European and Austrian tourism, this heralds the return of the most important Asian source market for the coming tourism seasons, But the European Union has been split over how to deal with the growing number of cases in China. 
对于欧洲和奥地利的旅游业来说，这预示着最重要的亚洲客源市场将在即将到来的旅游旺季回归。但欧盟在如何处理中国日益增多的病例问题上存在分歧。

No one bothered to inform the residents why the southern tip of their island home was suddenly no longer accessible. All they knew was that the place where women for generations had scoured the craggy tide pools for crabs and where farmers had long tended fields of taro and millet had suddenly been turned into a large construction site. Rumors began to fly. It was a pineapple cannery. No, it was a cannery for fish. Whatever it was, the locals decided, it would mean more jobs for the islanders.
没有人费心去告诉民众，为什么他们所居岛屿的南端突然不能去了。他们只知道，这个世世代代的女性在崎岖潮池中捕蟹、农民种植芋头和小米的地方，突然变成了大型建筑工地。谣言开始四起。那是一家凤梨罐头厂。不，是做鱼罐头的。不管是什么，当地人都以为，那能给岛民带来更多就业机会。
