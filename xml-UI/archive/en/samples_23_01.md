Predicting the path of the pandemic has always been difficult. Even in places like Britain with reliable data, forecasts have often been far off the mark. The country has said it will only count those who die from respiratory failure directly linked to an infection, leaving out vast numbers who died because Covid aggravated underlying diseases or caused heart or liver failure. But scientists have generally used reported Covid deaths as a dependable barometer to determine the potential size of an outbreak.
预测疫情传播路径一直很困难。即使在英国这样有可靠数据的地方，预测结果也常与实际相去甚远。该国表示，将只统计感染直接导致的呼吸衰竭死亡病例，不会包括大量因新冠导致基础疾病加重或心脏肝脏衰竭的死亡。但科学家通常将报告的新冠死亡数视为可靠标尺，来确定疫情的潜在规模。

The plateau is close to “Chicken’s Neck,” a narrow corridor of Indian territory that connects mainland India to its northeastern states, an area the size of Oregon, where 45 million people live. A few years later, the most lethal confrontation on the disputed border occurred in the northern Ladakh region in June 2020 when Chinese soldiers killed at least 20 Indian soldiers with wooden staves and nail-studded clubs
洞朗高原靠近“鸡脖子”，也就是印度领土上连接印度本土及其东北部各邦的一条狭窄走廊，后者面积相当于俄勒冈州，居住着4500万人口。几年后，北部拉达克地区在2020年6月发生了该争议边界上最致命的对抗，当时中国士兵用木棍和狼牙棒打死了至少20名印度士兵

Within India, Mr. Modi’s strongman image has taken a dent from the confrontation with China. His insistence that India has not lost territory to China provides ammunition to his supporters, but the numbers of his blind supporters have dwindled. 
在印度国内，莫迪的强人形象因与中国的对抗而被削弱。他坚称印度没有将领土拱手让给中国，从而为他的支持者提供依据，但不假思索地选择支持他的人在减少。

Casino gambling gave immigrants in low-wage jobs a “false sense of accomplishment.” Even as many of the people surveyed said they had borrowed money from friends or loan sharks to keep gambling, they also said casinos were the only entertainment option accessible to them.
赌场赌博给从事底薪工作的移民一种“虚假的成就感”。尽管许多受访者说，他们曾向朋友或高利贷借钱继续赌博，但他们也表示，赌场是他们唯一可以得到的娱乐方式。

Mr. McCarthy himself sought to make the conflict about something bigger than himself in an appeal to his opponents to put aside whatever feelings they had about him so Republicans could move forward. But the holdouts were not yet budging.
麦卡锡本人试图强调这并非一场关于他的冲突，希望这能打动反对的人，让他们搁置对他的不满，帮助共和党向前推进。但是反对者不为所动。

The national exam is an annual rite for young Chinese, some of whom spend thousands of dollars for prep classes and many hours cramming for it. It comes at a fraught time. It was supposed to be given in early December, then was canceled at the last minute. Jobs in China’s vast Civil Service have long been considered prestigious launching pads for a career. But these days the jobs are also coveted out of necessity, because it’s especially hard for new graduates to find employment at private companies.
对许多中国年轻人来说，国考是一年一度的大事情，有的人花不少钱参加备考班，花很多时间来突击准备。而现在是一个令人忧虑的时刻。原定于12月初举行的考试在最后一刻取消了。中国的公务员是一支庞大的队伍，长期以来，公务员一直被视为职业生涯中备受仰视的跳板。但如今公务员职位令人垂涎也是出于必然，因为应届毕业生在民营企业找工作越来越难。

The competition for public service positions is so fierce that people often refer to them with a Chinese saying: “thousands of troops crossing a single-plank bridge.” The exam is rigorous. Then there’s the reality of Civil Service work. Some say their days are ruled by rigid hierarchies and involve monotonous chores. Others, while saying they enjoy their jobs, complain that their responsibilities often sprawl beyond normal work hours.
公务员岗位竞争激烈，人们常将其形容为“千军万马过独木桥”。这是一个严格的考试。然后是公务员工作的现实。有人说他们的日子被严格的等级制度所统治，做的是单调的杂事。也有人说他们喜欢自己的工作，但抱怨经常要加班加点。

Walls are plastered not with “help wanted” signs, but with notices from entrepreneurs putting their businesses up for sale. Roads and alleys once packed with migrant workers are now mostly empty. Now, faced with an unpredictable — and uncontrolled — epidemic and financial uncertainty, people and companies are spending cautiously, suggesting that the road to recovery will be uneven and painful.
街道两旁的商店和作坊关闭了。墙上贴的不是招聘启示，而是店面出售的通知。曾经挤满外来务工者的马路和小巷现在大多空无一人。现在，面对难以预测且不受控制的疫情以及金融的不确定性，个人和企业都在支出方面保持谨慎，这表明复苏之路将是崎岖且痛苦的。

The spending boom is also set to reduce, though not erase, U.S. reliance on Asia for other kinds of chips. The chip-making boom is expected to create a jobs bonanza of 40,000 new roles in factories and companies that supply them, And a severe shortage in skills may undercut the boom
投资热潮也将降低（但不会消除）美国在其他类型芯片上对亚洲的依赖。芯片制造投资热潮有望在供应这些芯片的工厂和公司中创造4万个新职位。这方面技能的严重短缺可能会削弱投资

Since training efforts may take years to bear fruit, industry executives want to make it easier for highly educated foreign workers to obtain visas to work in the United States. Officials in Washington are aware that comments encouraging more immigration could invite political fire.
由于培训工作可能需要数年时间才能见效，行业高管希望政府让受过高等教育的外国工人更容易获得在美国工作的签证，华盛顿的官员意识到，鼓励更多移民的说法可能会在政治上引火烧身。

We firmly oppose the practice of manipulating Covid prevention and control measures to achieve political goals, and will take corresponding measures in accordance with the principle of reciprocity according to different situations, She did not elaborate.
我们对试图操弄疫情防控措施以达到政治目的的做法表示坚决反对，将针对不同情况本着对等原则采取相应措施。她没有详细说明。

The government in December dismantled a sprawling testing apparatus that required residents to test regularly, and scrapped its strategy of lockdowns and grueling quarantine that applied not just to those who tested positive but also their contacts. But some European countries have begun putting in place restrictions for visitors from China without waiting for E.U. guidance.
去年12月，政府取消了定期的大规模核酸检测要求，以及对阳性患者和密接的封锁和严格隔离政策。但一些欧洲国家没有等待欧盟的指南，已经开始对来自中国的游客实施限制。

For three years, Western media coverage has treated the Covid situation in China like a spectacle, an opportunity to gawk at the toxic cesspool contained in self-imposed isolation across the ocean. And the introduction of stringent requirements for travelers can be logistically cumbersome, discriminatory and politically toxic.
三年来，西方媒体的报道一直把中国的新冠疫情当作一场奇观对待，一个对大洋彼岸自我孤立的有毒渊薮瞠目结舌的机会。对旅行者提出严格的要求可能会造成旅程管理上的麻烦，具有歧视性，并且会成为政治毒药。

For European and Austrian tourism, this heralds the return of the most important Asian source market for the coming tourism seasons, But the European Union has been split over how to deal with the growing number of cases in China. 
对于欧洲和奥地利的旅游业来说，这预示着最重要的亚洲客源市场将在即将到来的旅游旺季回归。但欧盟在如何处理中国日益增多的病例问题上存在分歧。

No one bothered to inform the residents why the southern tip of their island home was suddenly no longer accessible. All they knew was that the place where women for generations had scoured the craggy tide pools for crabs and where farmers had long tended fields of taro and millet had suddenly been turned into a large construction site. Rumors began to fly. It was a pineapple cannery. No, it was a cannery for fish. Whatever it was, the locals decided, it would mean more jobs for the islanders.
没有人费心去告诉民众，为什么他们所居岛屿的南端突然不能去了。他们只知道，这个世世代代的女性在崎岖潮池中捕蟹、农民种植芋头和小米的地方，突然变成了大型建筑工地。谣言开始四起。那是一家凤梨罐头厂。不，是做鱼罐头的。不管是什么，当地人都以为，那能给岛民带来更多就业机会。

Unlike other attempts to topple governments across Latin America’s history, the attacks on Sunday were not ordered by a single strongman ruler or a military bent on seizing power, but rather were fueled by a more insidious, deeply rooted threat: mass delusion.
与拉丁美洲历史上试图颠覆政府的其他行动不同，周日的袭击事件并非由强人统治者或决心夺取政权的军队所发动，而是出于更加隐蔽且根深蒂固的危机：集体妄想。

People filing out of the encampment on Monday morning, carrying rolled-up air mattresses, extension cords and stools, each had a clear message: Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters had not ransacked the buildings.
周一早上，营地里的人带着卷好的充气床垫、插线板和凳子鱼贯而出，每个人的态度都是明确的：博尔索纳罗的支持者没有洗劫那些大楼。

Have you ever heard of the Trojan Horse? The infiltrators went in and set everything up, and the damn press showed the Brazilian nation that we patriots are the hooligans. a far-right populist incumbent with a penchant for insults and off-the-cuff tweets against a septuagenarian challenger on the left running on his proven political track record and a promise to unite a divided nation.
你知道特洛伊木马的故事吗？卧底闯进去安排好了一切，而该死的媒体告诉巴西人民，我们这些爱国者才是流氓。一位热衷于羞辱冒犯和即兴发推的极右翼民粹主义现任总统，对上一位年逾七旬、政治履历久经考验并承诺要团结一个分裂国家的左翼挑战者。

On Monday, Mr. Lula spoke with President Biden, who conveyed “the unwavering support of the United States for Brazil’s democracy and for the free will of the Brazilian people, What they want is a coup, and they won’t have one,”
周一，卢拉与拜登总统通话，后者表达了“美国对巴西民主和巴西人民的自由意志的坚决支持”，他们想要的是一场政变，他们休想得逞

To assist its older workers, the company built a ramp to the front door and moved electrical wires previously strung across the factory floor to the walls and ceilings to prevent employees from tripping. it would be very sad for anyone to die working, You shouldn’t work until the end like that.
为了给老年工人提供帮助，公司在大门前修了一个坡道，并把以前安装在工厂地板上的电线改装到墙上和天花板上，以防止员工绊倒。任何人在工作中死去都会非常悲哀，你不应该那样工作到最后一刻。

Li Man, 67, was forced to retire at 45 from a job at a state-owned refrigerated warehouse in Beijing. Ms. Li figured she could still work “in the prime time of my life” to afford her daughter’s tuition and living expenses at film school in California. She started babysitting and selling homemade dishes like braised fish and stir-fried pork with squash to neighbors. Yet lately, she is plagued by back pain and high blood pressure.
67岁的李曼（音）在45岁时被迫从北京一家国有冷冻仓库退休。李曼认为她仍然可以“在自己人生的黄金时期”工作，以支付女儿在加州电影学校的学费和生活费。她开始帮人带孩子，做红烧鱼和南瓜炒肉等家常菜卖给邻居。然而最近，她饱受背痛和高血压的困扰。

Once widely used as a refrigerant and in foam insulation, CFC-11 was first synthesized a century ago. Along with similar chemicals, collectively called chlorofluorocarbons, CFC-11 destroys ozone, which blocks ultraviolet radiation from the sun that can cause skin cancer and otherwise harm people, plants and animals. 
CFC-11于一个世纪前首次合成，曾被广泛用作制冷剂和泡沫绝缘材料。与统称为氯氟烃的类似化学物质一样，CFC-11会破坏臭氧，而臭氧的作用在于阻挡来自太阳的紫外线辐射，这些辐射会导致皮肤癌并以其他方式伤害人类和动植物。

But unease, from both travelers and nations that have long waited to welcome deep-pocketed Chinese tourists again, has tempered the celebratory mood. On Jeju Island, a South Korean destination once favored by Chinese tourists, many businesses are in wait-and-see mode. Thailand’s response has been friendlier. One government minister floated the idea of offering booster vaccines to Chinese tourists. 
但来自旅行者和一些国家的不安给庆祝的气氛泼下冷水，一些国家曾一直在等待迎接出手阔绰的中国游客。在曾经深受中国游客青睐的韩国旅游胜地济州岛，不少商家都处于观望状态。泰国的反应更为友好。一位政府部长提出了向中国游客提供疫苗加强针的想法。

There are key gaps in the public record about both, but the available information suggests there were significant differences in how the documents came to light, their volume and — most important — how Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden responded. 
两者的公开记录都存在关键缺失，但现有信息表明，这些文件被发现的方式、文件的数量以及——最重要的——特朗普和拜登的回应方式，存在显著差异。

“Spare,” the hotly anticipated memoir by Prince Harry, has captivated people across the world, and is shaping up to be one of the year’s biggest books. A series of high-profile interviews, along with leaked excerpts and premature sales of the book in Spain, heightened interest in a memoir that offers a frank, if one-sided, look at Harry’s life.
《备用》(Spare)是哈里王子备受期待的回忆录，吸引了世界各地的读者，有望成为今年最畅销的书籍之一。一系列的高调采访，加上泄露出来的片段，以及西班牙文版提前在西班牙销售，增加了人们对这本回顾哈里人生的坦率自传的兴趣，尽管它只是一面之词。

He talks candidly about Princess Diana’s death. Still, he saw many paparazzi photos of his dying mother. The men who followed her “never stopped shooting her while she lay between the seats, unconscious, or semiconscious,”
哈里直言不讳地谈了戴安娜王妃之死. 他还是看到了多张狗仔拍下的母亲濒临死亡的照片。追着拍她的人“在她昏迷或半昏迷地倒在车座之间时，从未停止过拍照”，

On one occasion, Harry writes, Charles — advised by a spin doctor — cooperated with the tabloids on a story about Harry and drugs to bolster his own faltering reputation. “No more the unfaithful husband, Pa would now be presented to the world as the harried single dad coping with a drug-addled child.”
哈里写道，有一次，在一名擅长导向性陈述的人建议下，为巩固他自己摇摇欲坠的声誉，查尔斯在一篇关于哈里与毒品的报道中与小报进行了合作。“在这篇报道中，爸不再是那个不忠的丈夫，而是被描述为一名烦扰不断的单身父亲，需要妥善处理一个吸毒成瘾的孩子。”

One evening during their courtship, “Meg said something I took the wrong way,” so “I snapped at her, spoke to her harshly — cruelly.” Meghan left the room. “I went and found her upstairs. She was sitting in the bedroom. She was calm, but said in a quiet, level tone that she would never stand for being spoken to like that.” Did you overhear adults speak that way when you were growing up?I cleared my throat, looked away. Yes.
他们谈恋爱期间的一个晚上，“我误会了梅格说的一些东西”，所以“对她发了火，对她说了残酷、甚至残忍的话”。梅根离开了房间。“我上楼找到了她。她坐在卧室里。她很平静，但用平静、平和的语调说，她永远不会忍受别人这样对她说话。”你长大成人的过程中无意中听到过大人们这样说话吗？我清了清嗓子，把目光移开。是的。

We agreed to serve the monarch, go wherever we were sent, do whatever we were told, surrender our autonomy, keep our hands and feet in the gilded cage at all times, and in exchange the keepers of the cage agreed to feed and clothe us.”
我们同意侍奉君主，叫我们去哪儿就去哪儿，让我们干什么就干什么，放弃我们的自主权，将我们的手脚始终困在镀金笼子里，作为交换，看笼子的人同意让我们有吃有穿。

But it wasn’t about money, of course: “Pa might have dreaded the rising cost of maintaining us, but what he really couldn’t stomach was someone new dominating the monarchy, grabbing the limelight, someone shiny and new coming in and overshadowing him.”
但这当然不只是钱的问题：“爸可能会担心不断上升的维持我们生活的费用，但他真正无法忍受的是，新来的人占了这个君主制的主导地位，吸引公众注意力，一个光鲜夺目的新来者让他相形见绌。”

The paps had always been grotesque people, but as I reached maturity they were worse, They were more emboldened, more radicalized, just as young men in Iraq had been radicalized. Their mullahs were editors, the same ones who’d vowed to do better after Mummy died.
狗仔一直都是一群丑陋的人，但在我长大成人的过程中，他们已变得更遭，他们更胆大妄为，手法更激进，就像伊拉克的年轻人被激进化了那样。编辑是他们的毛拉，也就是那些在妈妈死后曾发誓要有所改进的人。

It’s very damaging for Chinese society if society is divided into very antagonistic groups — who are equally powerless, equally helpless — and they accuse each other, By far, the more vocal side is made up of those who supported “zero Covid” 
如果社会被分化成意见非常敌对的群体，让这些同样无能为力、同样无助的群体相互指责，这对中国社会非常有害，到目前为止，这些争论中声音最大的一方由那些曾支持新冠“清零”的人组成

He emphasized, though, that he expected Chinese people to fall in line, and to “think in one direction, work in one direction. The strength of tomorrow’s China comes from unity,” At this moment, what we need most is to abide by the 44-year-old parable: ‘Look forward in unity,’ do not challenge, tear apart, especially denounce or abuse,
但他强调希望中国人保持一致，“心往一处想、劲往一处使，同舟共济、众志成城，就没有干不成的事、迈不过的坎。” 此刻，我们最需信守的，还是44年前的那句老话：‘团结一致向前看’ 而不是对立、撕裂，更不是攻讦、谩骂，

The Chinese economy enjoys strong resilience, tremendous potential and great vitality. The fundamentals sustaining its long-term growth have remained strong, Chinese people will “stay confident.” The hallmark initiatives of only a few years ago are starting to be reversed. there are signs that Big Tech may be finally be emerging from the regulatory doghouse.
中国经济韧性强、潜力大、活力足，长期向好的基本面依然不变，中国人民“笃定信心”。几年前的标志性举措已开始彻底转变。已有迹象表明，国内的大型科技企业也许终将摆脱受到严格监管的冷落地位。

this latest about-face is acknowledgment of the fragile state of the nation’s economy. Growth is at its slowest rate in decades, hampered by a property market in crisis, a lack of promising jobs for young people, consumer confidence shaken by years of rigid Covid policies and depleted local government coffers.
最近这次180度的大转弯等于承认了国内经济的脆弱状态。由于房地产市场陷入危机，年轻人找不到有前途的工作，消费者信心被多年的严格政策动摇，加上地方政府资金枯竭，中国经济的增长率已降到几十年来的最低水平。

President Yoon’s comment could turn out to be a watershed moment in the history of South Korea’s national security, It could shift its paradigm in how to deal with the North Korean nuclear threat. Washington’s repeated promise to protect its ally — with its own nuclear weapons, if necessary — has not dissipated such fear. it could trigger a regional arms race and eliminate any hope of ridding North ​Korea ​of its nuclear weapons.
尹总统的言论可能成为韩国国家安全史上的一个分水岭时刻，可能会改变应对朝鲜核威胁的观念。华盛顿一再承诺保护其盟友，甚至在必要时使用自己的核武器，但这些承诺并没有消除这种恐惧。可能会引发地区军备竞赛，从而使解除朝鲜核武器的希望破灭。

More than a decade ago, in the northeastern city of Baoding, the son of Li Gang, a deputy police chief, killed a college student while drunkenly driving his Volkswagen sedan. As he was apprehended, he yelled, “My father is Li Gang!” Propaganda officials tried to cover up the incident, but the phrase became a grim joke symbolizing the impunity of powerful local officials and those connected to them.
十几年前，在东北部城市保定，公安局副局长李刚的儿子醉酒驾驶一辆大众轿车撞死一名大学生。在被制服时，他大喊“我爸是李刚”。宣传官员后来试图掩盖这一事件，但这句话逐渐成为有权有势的地方官员以及和他们有关系的人逍遥法外的象征。

The nondescript, six-story office building on a busy street in New York’s Chinatown lists several mundane businesses on its lobby directory, including an engineering company, an acupuncturist and an accounting firm.
这座不起眼的六层写字楼位于纽约唐人街一条繁忙的街道上，大堂的租户名录上列出了几家寻常公司，包括一家工程公司、一个针灸工作室和一家会计师事务所。

It is not automatically inappropriate for police officers to work overseas. The F.B.I., for example, posts agents abroad. If they perform law enforcement duties, it is with the permission of the local authorities. That makes the off-the-books operations all the more curious. The Chinese officials wanted the N.Y.P.D. to sign a memorandum of understanding to outline the training program and make it official. 
警察在海外工作不一定就是不正当。例如，FBI也在国外派驻特工。如果履行执法职责，则需要获得地方当局的许可。这使得这些未置于台面之上的操作更加令人好奇。中国官员想让纽约警局签署谅解备忘录，概述培训计划，并使之具有正式效力。

he had not yet seen grounds for impeaching Mr. Biden, Republicans have already introduced a host of impeachment articles against the president and members of his cabinet, and some influential members on the right have said they relish the prospect of trying him for high crimes and misdemeanors.
他还没有看到弹劾拜登的理由，但共和党人已经提出了一系列针对总统及其内阁成员的弹劾条款，一些有影响力的右翼成员表示，他们乐于见到以重罪和轻罪审判拜登的前景。

Substantive policy questions: This remains to be seen. The text of the resolution establishing the subcommittee gives the panel essentially open-ended jurisdiction to scrutinize any issue related to civil liberties
实质性政策问题：还有待观察。成立小组委员会的决议案内容赋予该小组基本不受限制的管辖权，以审查任何有关公民自由的问题

Substantive policy questions: Lawmakers say they want to explore whether the U.S. government should be funding so-called gain-of-function research, a narrow sliver of scientific inquiry that can involve tinkering with viruses in a way that could make them more dangerous.  Dr. Fauci has said he has a “completely open mind” about whether the outbreak originated in a lab, but that the preponderance of evidence shows it was a natural occurrence.
实质性政策问题：议员们表示，他们想探讨美国政府是否应该资助所谓的“功能增益”研究，这是一个很小的科学探索领域，可能涉及改造病毒使其变得更加危险。福奇博士曾表示，他对疫情是否起源于实验室持“完全开放的态度”，但大量证据表明这是自然发生的。

But some Republicans would prefer not to focus on the topic, which would inevitably involve rehashing what happened during the assault and their roles in Mr. Trump’s election subversion efforts.
但一些共和党人宁愿不参与这个议题，因为那必然将重提袭击时发生的事情，以及他们在特朗普颠覆选举的努力中所扮演的角色。
