It was clear to him even then that innovation took place when people could pursue their interests and think freely. Historical examples tell us that national mobilization cannot catch up with freewheeling development that comes naturally on its own
那时他就已经明白，只有当人可以追求自己的兴趣和自由思考时，创新才能出现。历史上的例子告诉我们，举国之力追不上自行其是的自由发展

Why else would a great power be spooked by a flimsy inflatable craft, China has argued, if not for a raft of internal problems like an intensely divided society and intractable partisan strife driving President Biden to act tough on Beijing?
中国提出质疑，如果不是因为美国国内存在严重的社会分裂和难以应对的党派斗争等大量问题，迫使拜登总统对中国采取强硬做法的话，一个强大的国家怎么会被一个薄而易破的充气飞艇吓到

The logic of zero-sum competition with China has become so pervasive in Washington among members of both parties that it risks undermining America’s own interests. “When individuals feel the need to out-hawk one another to protect themselves and advance professionally,” she wrote in Foreign Affairs last year, “the result is groupthink.”
与中国展开零和博弈的逻辑在华盛顿的两党成员中已经变得如此普遍，以至于有可能损害美国自身的利益。去年，她在《外交事务》杂志上写道：“如果个人觉得为了保护自己和职业发展，有必要比别人表现得更强硬，就会产生群体思维。”

As Steven Rattner, a counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration, wrote in The Times last month, “even many free-market conservatives seem to recognize that unfettered capitalism can lead to imperfect results.”
正如奥巴马政府财政部长的顾问史蒂文·拉特纳上个月在时报上所写，“甚至许多自由市场保守派似乎也认识到，不受约束的资本主义会导致不完美的结果。”

Should this frosty dynamic persist, “a new type of Cuban-missile-crisis moment, when the fate of the world hangs in the balance, is not inconceivable,” Michael Schuman writes in The Atlantic. “Then the two adversaries may find that the channels of communication they’d need to avert disaster aren’t working, and their inimical attitudes are too entrenched to find a solution.”
如果这种冷淡的气氛持续下去，“当关乎世界命运的时刻到来时，一场新的古巴导弹危机并不是不可想象的，”迈克尔·舒曼在《大西洋》上写道。“然后这两个对手可能会发现他们避免灾难所需的沟通渠道不起作用，他们的敌对态度太根深蒂固，无法找到解决方案。”

When the rabbit dies, the fox grieves for fear it would be the next; when the lips are dead, the teeth will be cold. entrepreneurs were like “frightened birds.” “Confidence is slow to build but quick to dissipate,”
兔死狐悲，唇亡齿寒. 企业家就像“惊弓之鸟”。“信心这件事，起得慢，退得快，”

He became as famous as the founders he had helped shepherd and was a sought-after speaker at conferences in and outside China. He had always cultivated a rowdy-boy image and enjoyed talking about his hobbies such as boxing and Formula 1 racing. 
他变得和他帮助培养的创始人一样出名，并且是中国国内外会议上广受欢迎的演讲者。他一直以一个招摇外露的形象示人，喜欢谈论他的爱好，例如拳击和一级方程式赛车。

As the train rumbled across the Ukrainian countryside through a long night, the view outside the window left little to see, just the occasional streetlight or shadows of buildings in the distance. But neither could those watching the train go by see who was inside, nor would they likely have guessed had they stopped to wonder.
列车在漫漫长夜中隆隆驶过乌克兰的乡村，窗外几乎看不到什么东西，偶尔出现路灯或远处建筑物的影子。但是那些看着火车经过的人也看不到里面是谁，即使他们产生了好奇，也不可能猜到。

The immigration debate often centers on who should be welcomed into our country. Some even argue that multiculturalism dilutes our national character — that the very the essence of the country is somehow vanishing. But far from undermining the American experiment, immigrants enhance our culture by introducing new ideas, cuisines and art. They also enrich the English language.
移民辩论通常关注我们应该欢迎什么样的人进入我们的国家。有些人甚至争辩说，多元文化主义淡化了我们的民族性格——这个国家的精粹正在以某种方式消失。但移民绝非破坏美国的实验，移民通过引入新的思想、美食和艺术来增强我们的文化。移民还使英语变得更加丰富。

Scores of words are invented every day, while old words are pushed aside to make room for new ones. Some loans have a short life span; others become an essential part of our day-to-day. Their staying power can depend on the process of assimilation — the time it takes a group to enter the middle class and the connection that group retains to its origins.
每天都会出现几十个新单词，而旧单词会被推到一边，为新单词腾出空间。有些外来词的寿命很短；有些则成了我们日常生活的重要组成部分。它们能存在多久可能取决于同化过程——一个群体进入中产阶级所需的时间以及该群体与其根源的联系。

Our nation’s founders would likely understand little of what we say today, given the amount of fresh acquisitions we’re always making. John Adams, our second president, was convinced that American English required a federally funded version of L’Académie Française in order to safeguard the people’s tongue from “going to the dogs.”
鉴于我们总是吸纳大量的新东西，开国元勋对我们今天的语言可能几乎一无所知。我们的第二任总统约翰·亚当斯确信，美国英语需要一个联邦政府资助的美国版法语学院，以防人们使用的语言“走向没落”。

Adams, fortunately, was on the losing side. American English is of, for and by the people, and its well-being depends on us. We do with it as we wish — or as we feel, since language is so often shaped by gut emotions. There are authorities within each language, of course, chief among them parents, educators, language scholars and dictionaries.
幸运的是，亚当斯是失败的一方。美语是民有、民享、民治的，它的发展取决于我们。我们按照自己的意愿或感觉来使用它，因为语言往往是由内心情感塑造的。当然，每种语言都有权威，主要是父母、教育家、语言学者和字典。

After a drumroll of diplomatic activity suggesting that China was poised to play a more energetic role in seeking peace in Ukraine, Beijing issued a paper on Friday that reprised its established views on the war, calling for an end to fighting while avoiding demands
在进行了一连串外交活动，暗示中国已准备在结束乌克兰战争上发挥更积极作用之后，北京上周五发布的文件重申了中国政府对这场战争的既定立场，呼吁停止战火

Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has created predicaments for China ever since he sent troops en masse across the Ukrainian border. Chinese leaders see Russia as a vital counterweight to American power, even if they may quietly wish that Mr. Putin would pull back from military belligerence.
自从普京大举出兵越过乌克兰边境以来，俄罗斯对乌克兰的入侵一直让中国处于尴尬境地。中国领导人将俄罗斯视为制约美国力量的重要抗衡，尽管他们可能私下里希望普京撤回在军事上挑衅西方的做法。

The new position paper sticks to that stance and euphemistic wording, and it suggests some continued sympathy with Mr. Putin’s underlying grievances with the United States and its allies. Countries should abandon a “Cold War mentality,” the paper says. Unilateral sanctions and maximum pressure cannot solve the issue; they only create new problems
中国发布的新立场坚持了以前的立场和委婉措辞，暗示中国仍在一定程度上同情普京对美国及其盟友的根本不满。立场文件称，各国应摒弃“冷战思维”，单边制裁、极限施压不仅解决不了问题，而且会制造出新的问题

As officials in Ukraine anxiously watch evolving diplomatic overtures between Moscow and Beijing, China’s top leader will host the president of Belarus — a staunch Kremlin ally — with the pomp of a state visit next week. Mr. Lukashenko and Mr. Xi had proclaimed an “all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership” between their countries. Pakistan is the only other country promised such an august-sounding level of official cooperation by China. China may gain symbolic and practical payoffs from closer ties with Belarus.
就在乌克兰官员紧张关注中俄两国不断演变的外交姿态之际，中国最高领导人将在下周以国事访问的高规格接待白俄罗斯总统——克里姆林宫的坚定盟友。卢卡申科和习近平在去年会晤时宣布将两国关系提升至“全天候全面战略伙伴关系”。能让中国就官方合作关系作出如此庄重承诺的另一个国家是巴基斯坦。与白俄罗斯建立更紧密的关系，可能让中国实现面子和里子的双丰收。

The United States might be forced to confront the shocking realization that the industrial muscle instrumental in victories like that in World War II — President Franklin Roosevelt’s concept of America as “the arsenal of democracy” — has withered and been surpassed by China. Building a stronger deterrence by addressing such weaknesses is the best means of averting war. 
美国可能会被迫面对一个令人震惊的现实，那就是，对取得第二次世界大战那种胜利至关重要的美国工业力量——那种让罗斯福总统将美国视为“民主制度的军火库”的力量——已经萎缩，并已被中国超越。通过解决这些弱点来建立更强大的威慑力是避免战争的最佳手段。

For many people, enjoying a freshly brewed cup of coffee first thing in the morning is a nonnegotiable way to start the day. But the idea that taking a sip without food could harm your gut — or contribute to other ills like bloating, acne, hair loss, anxiety, thyroid issues or painful periods, as some on social media have claimed — has garnered as much popularity as incredulity. Fortunately, the stomach can withstand all kinds of irritants, including coffee.
对许多人来说，早上第一件事就是喝一杯鲜煮咖啡，必须这样开启新的一天。但有人说空腹喝咖啡会伤害肠道——或者像一些社交媒体上说的，会导致腹胀、痤疮、脱发、焦虑、甲状腺问题或痛经等其他疾病——这些说法广为流传，但也有不少质疑。幸运的是，胃可以抵御各种刺激物，包括咖啡。

Dr. Cryer regularly enjoys his coffee as a latte or cappuccino — the steamed milk cuts down the bitterness, he said. And, in general, he added, coffee drinking has many health benefits, including links to longevity, a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and protection against many cancers, including liver, prostate, breast and colorectal cancer. There’s far more evidence for coffee’s benefits than harms
克莱尔常喝拿铁或卡布奇诺，他说加入奶泡可以减少苦涩口感。他还表示，喝咖啡总体来说对健康有很多好处，包括延年益寿、降低心血管疾病风险，还能预防多种癌症，包括肝癌、前列腺癌、乳腺癌和结直肠癌。咖啡利大于弊的证据要多得多

Two years ago, when Condé Nast announced that Margaret Zhang would be the next editor in chief of Vogue China, many in the fashion media were taken aback.For one thing, at just 27, Ms. Zhang was the youngest ever editor in chief of a Vogue title. For another, there was her unorthodox multi-hyphenate résumé as a photographer, consultant, filmmaker, model and social media influencer — with almost no magazine experience. 
两年前，当康泰纳仕宣布章凝将成为中国版《Vogue》的下一任主编时，许多时尚媒体都大吃一惊。首先，当时只有27岁的章凝是Vogue杂志有史以来最年轻的主编。其次，她有着非同寻常的多重履历，做过摄影师、顾问、电影制作人、模特和社交媒体网红——但几乎没有做杂志的经验。

Its next editor would need to have an ambitious vision, formidable connections and commercial and diplomatic savvy — a challenge for someone twice, or even three times, Ms. Zhang’s age and experience, let alone a foreigner. How would it feel to step into a job like that, knowing how many people expect you to fail?
它的下一任主编需要有雄心勃勃的愿景、强大的人脉，以及商业和外交头脑——这对年龄和经验是章凝两倍甚至三倍的人来说都是挑战，更不用说她是个外国人了。知道有那么多人不看好你，接手这样的工作是什么感觉？

Ms. Zhang’s magazine covers and the content inside are striking, rooted in bold saturated color and the candid style that initially found her fame as an influencer. It was really dangerous to have such a person be the editorial director of Vogue China,Why? Because she has been growing up and living in Australia and overseas, her understanding of China is too superficial and limited.
章凝的杂志封面和内容醒目抢眼，植根于大胆的饱和色彩和直率的风格，这正是她当初成为知名网红的原因。到Vogue中国版主编的人选，为什么我说挑选章凝会非常危险？因为她一直在澳大利亚和海外成长生活，她对中国的了解太过肤浅局限。

Uncertainties in the external environment are on the rise, At home, the foundation for stable growth needs to be consolidated, insufficient demand remains a pronounced problem, and the expectations of private investors and businesses are unstable.
外部环境不确定性加大，国内经济增长企稳向上基础尚需巩固，需求不足仍是突出矛盾，民间投资和民营企业预期不稳。

“Almost everyone I met told me that the United States will not permit a powerful China by its side, especially in the Indo-Pacific region,” Professor Chao said. Their strategy, he added, is: “Contesting without tipping into a rupture.”
赵春山说，“我见到的几乎所有人都对我说，美国不会允许一个强大的中国与其平起平坐，尤其是在印太地区。”他还说，他们的策略是“斗而不破”。

Despite Beijing’s cold shoulder, there is little upside for Kyiv to be seen antagonizing China. If Beijing were to provide arms to Russia, it could significantly alter the shape of the year-old conflict and give Moscow a much-needed lifeline in what has become a grueling war of attrition.
虽然遭到北京的冷遇，但与其为敌对乌克兰来说并无多少好处。如果中国向俄罗斯提供军火，可能会让这场持续一年之久的冲突局势发生重大改变，并在这场已经演变为艰苦消耗战的对抗中为俄罗斯提供一条急需的生命线。

Last month, at a meeting in India of Group of 20 finance ministers, the U.S. Treasury secretary, Janet L. Yellen, confronted Russian officials in a group meeting and said they had a “moral imperative” to end the war. She also told them they were “complicit in Putin’s atrocities.”
在上个月印度举行的二十国集团财长会议上，美国财政部长珍妮特·L·耶伦就在一次小组会议上质问俄方官员，称他们有结束战争的“道德义务”。她还告知对方，他们都是“普京暴行的同谋”。
