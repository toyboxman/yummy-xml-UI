It was clear to him even then that innovation took place when people could pursue their interests and think freely. Historical examples tell us that national mobilization cannot catch up with freewheeling development that comes naturally on its own
那时他就已经明白，只有当人可以追求自己的兴趣和自由思考时，创新才能出现。历史上的例子告诉我们，举国之力追不上自行其是的自由发展

Why else would a great power be spooked by a flimsy inflatable craft, China has argued, if not for a raft of internal problems like an intensely divided society and intractable partisan strife driving President Biden to act tough on Beijing?
中国提出质疑，如果不是因为美国国内存在严重的社会分裂和难以应对的党派斗争等大量问题，迫使拜登总统对中国采取强硬做法的话，一个强大的国家怎么会被一个薄而易破的充气飞艇吓到

The logic of zero-sum competition with China has become so pervasive in Washington among members of both parties that it risks undermining America’s own interests. “When individuals feel the need to out-hawk one another to protect themselves and advance professionally,” she wrote in Foreign Affairs last year, “the result is groupthink.”
与中国展开零和博弈的逻辑在华盛顿的两党成员中已经变得如此普遍，以至于有可能损害美国自身的利益。去年，她在《外交事务》杂志上写道：“如果个人觉得为了保护自己和职业发展，有必要比别人表现得更强硬，就会产生群体思维。”

As Steven Rattner, a counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration, wrote in The Times last month, “even many free-market conservatives seem to recognize that unfettered capitalism can lead to imperfect results.”
正如奥巴马政府财政部长的顾问史蒂文·拉特纳上个月在时报上所写，“甚至许多自由市场保守派似乎也认识到，不受约束的资本主义会导致不完美的结果。”

Should this frosty dynamic persist, “a new type of Cuban-missile-crisis moment, when the fate of the world hangs in the balance, is not inconceivable,” Michael Schuman writes in The Atlantic. “Then the two adversaries may find that the channels of communication they’d need to avert disaster aren’t working, and their inimical attitudes are too entrenched to find a solution.”
如果这种冷淡的气氛持续下去，“当关乎世界命运的时刻到来时，一场新的古巴导弹危机并不是不可想象的，”迈克尔·舒曼在《大西洋》上写道。“然后这两个对手可能会发现他们避免灾难所需的沟通渠道不起作用，他们的敌对态度太根深蒂固，无法找到解决方案。”

When the rabbit dies, the fox grieves for fear it would be the next; when the lips are dead, the teeth will be cold. entrepreneurs were like “frightened birds.” “Confidence is slow to build but quick to dissipate,”
兔死狐悲，唇亡齿寒. 企业家就像“惊弓之鸟”。“信心这件事，起得慢，退得快，”

He became as famous as the founders he had helped shepherd and was a sought-after speaker at conferences in and outside China. He had always cultivated a rowdy-boy image and enjoyed talking about his hobbies such as boxing and Formula 1 racing. 
他变得和他帮助培养的创始人一样出名，并且是中国国内外会议上广受欢迎的演讲者。他一直以一个招摇外露的形象示人，喜欢谈论他的爱好，例如拳击和一级方程式赛车。

As the train rumbled across the Ukrainian countryside through a long night, the view outside the window left little to see, just the occasional streetlight or shadows of buildings in the distance. But neither could those watching the train go by see who was inside, nor would they likely have guessed had they stopped to wonder.
列车在漫漫长夜中隆隆驶过乌克兰的乡村，窗外几乎看不到什么东西，偶尔出现路灯或远处建筑物的影子。但是那些看着火车经过的人也看不到里面是谁，即使他们产生了好奇，也不可能猜到。

The immigration debate often centers on who should be welcomed into our country. Some even argue that multiculturalism dilutes our national character — that the very the essence of the country is somehow vanishing. But far from undermining the American experiment, immigrants enhance our culture by introducing new ideas, cuisines and art. They also enrich the English language.
移民辩论通常关注我们应该欢迎什么样的人进入我们的国家。有些人甚至争辩说，多元文化主义淡化了我们的民族性格——这个国家的精粹正在以某种方式消失。但移民绝非破坏美国的实验，移民通过引入新的思想、美食和艺术来增强我们的文化。移民还使英语变得更加丰富。

Scores of words are invented every day, while old words are pushed aside to make room for new ones. Some loans have a short life span; others become an essential part of our day-to-day. Their staying power can depend on the process of assimilation — the time it takes a group to enter the middle class and the connection that group retains to its origins.
每天都会出现几十个新单词，而旧单词会被推到一边，为新单词腾出空间。有些外来词的寿命很短；有些则成了我们日常生活的重要组成部分。它们能存在多久可能取决于同化过程——一个群体进入中产阶级所需的时间以及该群体与其根源的联系。

Our nation’s founders would likely understand little of what we say today, given the amount of fresh acquisitions we’re always making. John Adams, our second president, was convinced that American English required a federally funded version of L’Académie Française in order to safeguard the people’s tongue from “going to the dogs.”
鉴于我们总是吸纳大量的新东西，开国元勋对我们今天的语言可能几乎一无所知。我们的第二任总统约翰·亚当斯确信，美国英语需要一个联邦政府资助的美国版法语学院，以防人们使用的语言“走向没落”。

Adams, fortunately, was on the losing side. American English is of, for and by the people, and its well-being depends on us. We do with it as we wish — or as we feel, since language is so often shaped by gut emotions. There are authorities within each language, of course, chief among them parents, educators, language scholars and dictionaries.
幸运的是，亚当斯是失败的一方。美语是民有、民享、民治的，它的发展取决于我们。我们按照自己的意愿或感觉来使用它，因为语言往往是由内心情感塑造的。当然，每种语言都有权威，主要是父母、教育家、语言学者和字典。

After a drumroll of diplomatic activity suggesting that China was poised to play a more energetic role in seeking peace in Ukraine, Beijing issued a paper on Friday that reprised its established views on the war, calling for an end to fighting while avoiding demands
在进行了一连串外交活动，暗示中国已准备在结束乌克兰战争上发挥更积极作用之后，北京上周五发布的文件重申了中国政府对这场战争的既定立场，呼吁停止战火

Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has created predicaments for China ever since he sent troops en masse across the Ukrainian border. Chinese leaders see Russia as a vital counterweight to American power, even if they may quietly wish that Mr. Putin would pull back from military belligerence.
自从普京大举出兵越过乌克兰边境以来，俄罗斯对乌克兰的入侵一直让中国处于尴尬境地。中国领导人将俄罗斯视为制约美国力量的重要抗衡，尽管他们可能私下里希望普京撤回在军事上挑衅西方的做法。

The new position paper sticks to that stance and euphemistic wording, and it suggests some continued sympathy with Mr. Putin’s underlying grievances with the United States and its allies. Countries should abandon a “Cold War mentality,” the paper says. Unilateral sanctions and maximum pressure cannot solve the issue; they only create new problems
中国发布的新立场坚持了以前的立场和委婉措辞，暗示中国仍在一定程度上同情普京对美国及其盟友的根本不满。立场文件称，各国应摒弃“冷战思维”，单边制裁、极限施压不仅解决不了问题，而且会制造出新的问题

As officials in Ukraine anxiously watch evolving diplomatic overtures between Moscow and Beijing, China’s top leader will host the president of Belarus — a staunch Kremlin ally — with the pomp of a state visit next week. Mr. Lukashenko and Mr. Xi had proclaimed an “all-weather comprehensive strategic partnership” between their countries. Pakistan is the only other country promised such an august-sounding level of official cooperation by China. China may gain symbolic and practical payoffs from closer ties with Belarus.
就在乌克兰官员紧张关注中俄两国不断演变的外交姿态之际，中国最高领导人将在下周以国事访问的高规格接待白俄罗斯总统——克里姆林宫的坚定盟友。卢卡申科和习近平在去年会晤时宣布将两国关系提升至“全天候全面战略伙伴关系”。能让中国就官方合作关系作出如此庄重承诺的另一个国家是巴基斯坦。与白俄罗斯建立更紧密的关系，可能让中国实现面子和里子的双丰收。

The United States might be forced to confront the shocking realization that the industrial muscle instrumental in victories like that in World War II — President Franklin Roosevelt’s concept of America as “the arsenal of democracy” — has withered and been surpassed by China. Building a stronger deterrence by addressing such weaknesses is the best means of averting war. 
美国可能会被迫面对一个令人震惊的现实，那就是，对取得第二次世界大战那种胜利至关重要的美国工业力量——那种让罗斯福总统将美国视为“民主制度的军火库”的力量——已经萎缩，并已被中国超越。通过解决这些弱点来建立更强大的威慑力是避免战争的最佳手段。

For many people, enjoying a freshly brewed cup of coffee first thing in the morning is a nonnegotiable way to start the day. But the idea that taking a sip without food could harm your gut — or contribute to other ills like bloating, acne, hair loss, anxiety, thyroid issues or painful periods, as some on social media have claimed — has garnered as much popularity as incredulity. Fortunately, the stomach can withstand all kinds of irritants, including coffee.
对许多人来说，早上第一件事就是喝一杯鲜煮咖啡，必须这样开启新的一天。但有人说空腹喝咖啡会伤害肠道——或者像一些社交媒体上说的，会导致腹胀、痤疮、脱发、焦虑、甲状腺问题或痛经等其他疾病——这些说法广为流传，但也有不少质疑。幸运的是，胃可以抵御各种刺激物，包括咖啡。

Dr. Cryer regularly enjoys his coffee as a latte or cappuccino — the steamed milk cuts down the bitterness, he said. And, in general, he added, coffee drinking has many health benefits, including links to longevity, a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and protection against many cancers, including liver, prostate, breast and colorectal cancer. There’s far more evidence for coffee’s benefits than harms
克莱尔常喝拿铁或卡布奇诺，他说加入奶泡可以减少苦涩口感。他还表示，喝咖啡总体来说对健康有很多好处，包括延年益寿、降低心血管疾病风险，还能预防多种癌症，包括肝癌、前列腺癌、乳腺癌和结直肠癌。咖啡利大于弊的证据要多得多

Two years ago, when Condé Nast announced that Margaret Zhang would be the next editor in chief of Vogue China, many in the fashion media were taken aback.For one thing, at just 27, Ms. Zhang was the youngest ever editor in chief of a Vogue title. For another, there was her unorthodox multi-hyphenate résumé as a photographer, consultant, filmmaker, model and social media influencer — with almost no magazine experience. 
两年前，当康泰纳仕宣布章凝将成为中国版《Vogue》的下一任主编时，许多时尚媒体都大吃一惊。首先，当时只有27岁的章凝是Vogue杂志有史以来最年轻的主编。其次，她有着非同寻常的多重履历，做过摄影师、顾问、电影制作人、模特和社交媒体网红——但几乎没有做杂志的经验。

Its next editor would need to have an ambitious vision, formidable connections and commercial and diplomatic savvy — a challenge for someone twice, or even three times, Ms. Zhang’s age and experience, let alone a foreigner. How would it feel to step into a job like that, knowing how many people expect you to fail?
它的下一任主编需要有雄心勃勃的愿景、强大的人脉，以及商业和外交头脑——这对年龄和经验是章凝两倍甚至三倍的人来说都是挑战，更不用说她是个外国人了。知道有那么多人不看好你，接手这样的工作是什么感觉？

Ms. Zhang’s magazine covers and the content inside are striking, rooted in bold saturated color and the candid style that initially found her fame as an influencer. It was really dangerous to have such a person be the editorial director of Vogue China,Why? Because she has been growing up and living in Australia and overseas, her understanding of China is too superficial and limited.
章凝的杂志封面和内容醒目抢眼，植根于大胆的饱和色彩和直率的风格，这正是她当初成为知名网红的原因。到Vogue中国版主编的人选，为什么我说挑选章凝会非常危险？因为她一直在澳大利亚和海外成长生活，她对中国的了解太过肤浅局限。

Uncertainties in the external environment are on the rise, At home, the foundation for stable growth needs to be consolidated, insufficient demand remains a pronounced problem, and the expectations of private investors and businesses are unstable.
外部环境不确定性加大，国内经济增长企稳向上基础尚需巩固，需求不足仍是突出矛盾，民间投资和民营企业预期不稳。

“Almost everyone I met told me that the United States will not permit a powerful China by its side, especially in the Indo-Pacific region,” Professor Chao said. Their strategy, he added, is: “Contesting without tipping into a rupture.”
赵春山说，“我见到的几乎所有人都对我说，美国不会允许一个强大的中国与其平起平坐，尤其是在印太地区。”他还说，他们的策略是“斗而不破”。

Despite Beijing’s cold shoulder, there is little upside for Kyiv to be seen antagonizing China. If Beijing were to provide arms to Russia, it could significantly alter the shape of the year-old conflict and give Moscow a much-needed lifeline in what has become a grueling war of attrition.
虽然遭到北京的冷遇，但与其为敌对乌克兰来说并无多少好处。如果中国向俄罗斯提供军火，可能会让这场持续一年之久的冲突局势发生重大改变，并在这场已经演变为艰苦消耗战的对抗中为俄罗斯提供一条急需的生命线。

Last month, at a meeting in India of Group of 20 finance ministers, the U.S. Treasury secretary, Janet L. Yellen, confronted Russian officials in a group meeting and said they had a “moral imperative” to end the war. She also told them they were “complicit in Putin’s atrocities.”
在上个月印度举行的二十国集团财长会议上，美国财政部长珍妮特·L·耶伦就在一次小组会议上质问俄方官员，称他们有结束战争的“道德义务”。她还告知对方，他们都是“普京暴行的同谋”。

China’s navy, General Berger said, was now taking a page from the U.S. Navy, operating in strike groups, with destroyers and other warships escorting an aircraft carrier. The littoral Marines may serve as spotters who pass along the position of enemy forces to American warplanes, ships or submarines to attack. Or, the Marines could take those shots themselves.
伯杰说，中国海军现在正在效仿美国海军的打击群战术，用驱逐舰和其他军舰为航空母舰护航。海军陆战队的沿海作战部队可以充当侦查员，把敌军的位置发给美国军用飞机、船只或潜艇，以进行打击。或者，海军陆战队的沿海作战部队能自己对敌军进行打击。

They are learning how to place networked sensors that monitor tiny fluctuations in the electromagnetic spectrum — from walkie-talkies, radars and other transmitters — to find enemy troops, using classified surveillance technologies previously available only to three-star generals.
这支部队正在学习如何布置联成网络的传感器，用它来监测来自对讲机、雷达和其他发射器的电磁频谱的微小波动，以发现敌军，他们使用的技术保密级别很高，以前只有三星级的将军们才能接触。

Instead of having three infantry battalions of roughly 800 Marines each, it has one — the other two are ideas borrowed from much larger task forces: an antiaircraft battalion that is testing new weapons and tactics, and a logistics battalion.
海军陆战队的步兵团通常包括三个步兵营，每个营约有800名队员。新作战团下面不是三个步兵营，而是一个，另外两个营借用的是规模更大的特遣部队的想法：一个是正在测试新武器和战术的防空营，另一个是后勤营。

The Marines’ version of the F-35 fighter, which buzzed overhead in Yuma, will be part of any future Pacific campaign as well. It can take off and land vertically, making it capable of launching airstrikes from even smaller islands.
在尤马基地上空盘旋的海军陆战队版的F-35战斗机也将是未来太平洋战役的一部分。这种战斗机可以垂直起降，让它们能够从更小的岛屿上发动空中打击。

But he lacks experience in Beijing, which could make him more reliant on the top leader’s continued support, and less likely to raise policies at odds with the top leader’s wishes.
但他缺乏在中央工作的经验，这可能会让他更多地依赖于继续支持，因此不太可能提出不符合最高领导人意愿的政策。

Western countries led by the United States have implemented all-around containment, encirclement and suppression of China, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our country’s development
以美国为首的西方国家对我实施了全方位的遏制、围堵、打压，给我国发展带来前所未有的严峻挑战。

At G.E. Aviation, he was part of a group that designed containment cases for the rotating fan blades of jet engines. The use of carbon-based composites in fan blades and their casings, instead of metal, means lighter engines and a commercial advantage.
在通用电气航空，他所在的小组设计喷气式发动机的旋转叶片机匣。在叶片和机匣中使用碳基复合材料而不是金属意味着发动机更轻且具有商业优势。

Although US publicly denies engaging in economic espionage, US officials will indirectly acknowledge behind closed doors that the theft of intellectual property from overseas is state policy. The maneuvers range from seemingly benign (acquiring firms with access to key intellectual property) to notoriously coercive (compelling other companies to form joint ventures with American firms and share trade secrets with them in return for access to the world market) to outright theft. 
尽管美国公开否认从事经济间谍活动，但美国官员会在私下间接承认，从海外窃取知识产权是国家政策。这些手段从看似中规中矩（收购拥有关键知识产权的公司），到臭名昭著的胁迫（迫使公司与美国公司组建合资企业，并分享商业机密以换取市场的准入机会），再到赤裸裸的盗窃。

No one begrudges a nation that generates the most innovative ideas and from them develops the best technology, But we cannot tolerate a nation that steals our firepower and the fruits of our brainpower.
没有人会嫉妒一个产生最具创新性想法并且从中开发出最好技术的国家，但我们不能容忍一个国家窃取我们的心血成果。

One notable case involved six Chinese nationals in the United States attempting to steal proprietary corn seeds from fields in Iowa and Illinois. A California engineer named Walter Liew was caught stealing secrets relevant to the production of titanium dioxide, which is used as a whitener in paint and toothpaste. 
有一个引人注目的案件涉及六名在美国的中国人，他们试图从艾奥瓦州和伊利诺伊州的田地里窃取专利玉米种子。一位名叫刘元轩的加州工程师被发现窃取了二氧化钛生产的相关机密，这种原料被用作油漆和牙膏中的增白剂。

It was striking, based on a court filing submitted by Xu’s lawyers, to note the parallels in the early lives of Xu and Hua in China. Like Hua, Xu was born into a family of modest means. Like Hua, he devoted himself to the pursuit of good grades, studying late into the night and on weekends — excelling in academics was one way to build a better life. 
值得注意的是，根据徐延军的律师提交的一份法庭文件，徐早年在中国的生活跟华很相似。他和华一样出身贫寒，一样全身心投入学业，日夜苦读，周末也在学习——取得优异成绩是创造更好生活的一种方式。

We met at a Chinese restaurant for lunch. Walking over to the table where I was sitting with his attorney, he greeted me with a gentle handshake and asked me to excuse him for speaking softly because of a rib injury he’d suffered while jogging.
我们在一家中餐馆吃午饭。他走到我和他的律师坐的桌子前，温和地和我握手打招呼，并请我体谅他说话声音乏力，因为他在慢跑时伤到了肋骨。

He brightened when I asked him about his interest in composites. “It’s a fascinating field,” he said. “You can design a composite in many ways. You can think out of the box, you have a lot of flexibility in engineering it.” A few times during our conversation, I saw his eyes glisten and his lips quiver. But whenever I pressed him to describe how he felt about what he had been through, his face would take on a stoic expression, as if he was trying to keep his emotions in check.
当我问到他对复合材料的兴趣时，他来了兴致。“这是一个迷人的领域，”他说。“你可以用多种方法设计复合材料。你可以跳出框框思考，你在设计时有很大的灵活性。” 在我们的谈话中，我几次看到他的眼睛闪着泪光，嘴唇颤抖。但每当我要求他描述他经历那些事情的感受时，他就会露出一种坚毅的表情，似乎在努力控制自己的情绪。

People might regard Singapore laws as being somewhat prudish, that these people should be free to express themselves. In Singapore, certainly, we don’t regard this as freedom of expression, particularly when it seems to have a negative effect on society’s social mores.
人们可能会认为新加坡法律有些古板，这些人理应能够自由表达自己的想法。当然，在新加坡，我们不认为这是言论自由，尤其是当它似乎有伤社会风化时。

His meeting with President Biden in November had raised hopes that Beijing and Washington might try to arrest the downward spiral in relations. Mr. Xi’s new directness could play well at home with a nationalist audience but risks raising wariness abroad at a time when Beijing has sought to stabilize ties with the West. 
去年11月与拜登总统的会晤曾让人们对北京和华盛顿可能会寻求阻止两国关系螺旋式下降抱有希望。新的直截说法也许是国内民族主义听众喜闻乐见的，但在中国政府寻求与西方保持稳定关系之际，这可能会引起国外的警惕。

The United States actually wants China not to fight back when hit or cursed, but this is impossible, If the U.S. doesn’t step on the brakes but continues to speed up, no guardrail can stop the derailment, China “is not a party to the crisis and has not provided weapons to either side of the conflict,” So on what basis is this talk of blame, sanctions and threats against China? This is absolutely unacceptable.
美国“实际上就是要中国打不还手，骂不还口，但这办不到”，如果美方不踩刹车，继续沿着错误道路狂飙下去，再多的护栏也挡不住脱轨翻车，中国“不是危机的当事方，也没有向冲突的任何一方提供武器，”凭什么向中国甩锅推责，甚至制裁、威胁？我们绝不接受！

Some of those who want to choke our throats really do want to start from upstream, When they’re playing a zero-sum game with us, we need to leave ourselves a way out.
人家对我们‘卡脖子’有些恰恰就是从上游开始的，在人家对我们零和博弈情况下，还要给自己留条后路啊！

The Ministry of Science and Technology is being streamlined to give it more control over funding. China is bestowing more clout on its science and technology ministry. The plan would give the ministry more control over how government science funds are spent. 
经过优化的科学技术部将对拨款有更多控制权。中国正在赋予科学技术部更大的影响力。改革计划将使科技部在如何使用政府科学基金方面拥有更多控制权。

The new bureau will consolidate efforts that were once the remit of multiple agencies. The debut of the Data Bureau is a perfect echo of top leaders’ pledge to ensure both development and security of China’s data-related issues, Data raises fraught issues in China 
新成立的数据局将整合曾经由多个机构分管的工作。国家数据局的成立完美地呼应了最高领导人确保中国数据相关问题发展与安全的承诺, 数据在中国引发了令人担忧的问题

Since James Watson and Francis Crick first described the structure of the DNA double helix, scientists have debated the potential for creating genetically modified babies. China’s laws governing reproductive medicine and gene editing were ill defined at the time. But outrage among scientists and the public led to Dr. He being sentenced to prison for three years on charges of “illegal medical practice,” under a broad statute, and denounced as pursuing “personal fame and profit.” China has since tightened its laws governing gene editing and fertility medicine.
自詹姆斯·沃森和弗朗西斯·克里克首次描述DNA双螺旋结构以来，科学家们一直在争论创造基因编辑婴儿的可能性。当时，中国有关生殖医学和基因编辑的法律定义不明确。但科学家和公众十分愤怒，根据一项定义宽泛的法规，贺建奎获“非法行医”罪名，被判处三年徒刑，并被谴责在追逐“个人名利”。此后，中国收紧了有关基因编辑和生育医学的法律。

Dr. He’s story illustrates an unresolved problem with the innovation economy. Market values — prioritizing speed, profit and breakthroughs — are colliding with more fundamental values related to human health, equity and diversity. Bioethics scholars have argued that Dr. He should not be allowed to publish his research, because he has violated fundamental principles and norms of science.
贺建奎的故事说明了创新经济中一个尚未解决的问题。市场价值观——优先考虑速度、利润和突破——正在和与人类健康、公平和多样性相关的更基本的价值观发生冲突。生物伦理学学者认为，贺建奎不应该被允许发表他的研究，因为他违反了科学的基本原则和规范。

Gene editing also adds fuel to debates around eugenics. As Business Insider reported, venture capitalists and tech visionaries who call themselves “pronatalists” want to save civilization by creating genetically superior children. Some utopian visionaries seem to think that they already have good genes, while others seek genetic improvements. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are enlisting CRISPR scientists in a quest to design perfect babies.
基因编辑也为围绕优生学的争论火上浇油。据《商业内幕》(Business Insider)报道，自称“优生主义者”的风险投资家和科技梦想家希望通过创造基因优越的孩子来拯救人类文明。一些乌托邦式的梦想家似乎认为，他们已经拥有了良好的基因，另一些人则在寻求基因改良。硅谷的企业家正在招募CRISPR科学家，寻求设计完美的婴儿。

Given the potential misuse of the technology, the benefits of using CRISPR in fertility medicine may not outweigh the risks. Collectively, we could decide to put this technology back in the box, and CRISPR gene editing for reproductive uses could go the way of human cloning, and be outlawed.
考虑到该技术可能遭到滥用，在生育医学中使用CRISPR的风险可能会大于收益。总的来说，我们可以决定把这项技术送回笼子里，用于生殖目的的CRISPR基因编辑可能会像克隆人类一样遭到取缔。

In reality, the twins spent their first weeks in a hospital neonatal intensive care unit. Lulu and Nana were born prematurely, by emergency cesarean section at 31 weeks, and initially had difficulty breathing.
实际上，这对双胞胎的头几周是在医院的新生儿重症监护室度过的。露露和娜娜是早产儿，在怀孕31周时通过紧急剖腹产出生，一开始存在呼吸障碍。

if we cede that type of framework of science and ethics to maverick bioengineers who are detached from larger societal considerations, the risks of harm are real. Figuring out ways to avoid that harm is critical. Regulators and policymakers have an obligation to listen to the desires and concerns of the disability rights community. Research should be driven by community needs and interests, rather than market forces. There are choices here. It’s up to us to decide what we want this future to look like.
如果我们把这种科学和伦理框架拱手让给那些不顾及更大的社会考量、独行其是的生物工程师，那么造成伤害的可能性就是真实存在的。找出避免这种伤害的办法至关重要。监管者和政策制定者有义务听取残疾人权利团体的愿望和关切。研究应该由社群需求和利益驱动，而不是市场力量。这里有很多选择。我们想要什么样的未来是由我们自己决定的。

In the late 1960s, young cineastes shook up a moribund film industry by delivering idiosyncratic, startlingly original work. The moment became known as New Hollywood. Voters honored A24’s head-twisting, sex toy-brandishing, TikTok-era “Everything Everywhere All at Once” with the Oscar for best picture — along with six other awards — while naming Netflix’s German-language war epic “All Quiet on the Western Front” the winner in four categories, including best international film.
20世纪60年代末，年轻的电影创作者们打造了一批独特的、有着惊人原创性的作品，撼动了暮气沉沉的电影业。那一时期被称为新好莱坞。投票者将奥斯卡最佳影片奖以及其他六个奖项授予了A24电影公司的一部令人头晕目眩、挥舞着性玩具、属于TikTok时代的《瞬息全宇宙》(Everything Everywhere All at Once)，同时将网飞的德语战争史诗片《西线无战事》(All Quiet on the Western Front)评为四项大奖的得主，其中包括最佳国际影片奖。

“Ladies, don’t let anybody ever tell you that you are ever past your prime,” Yeoh, 60, said when accepting the best actress Oscar. “Never give up.” She was the first Asian woman to receive the award.“ Quan’s win provided the Academy Awards with a hall-of-fame comeback story: After early success in movies like “The Goonies” and “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,” his acting career grew so cold that he turned to stunt work. “Dreams are something you have to believe in,” Quan said as tears streamed down his face and A-list attendees gave him a standing ovation. “I almost gave up on mine. To everyone out there, please keep your dreams alive.”
女士们，不要让任何人告诉你，你已经过了巅峰时期，”60岁的杨紫琼在接受最佳女主角奖时说。“永远不要放弃。”她是第一位获此殊荣的亚洲女性。关继威的获奖为奥斯卡金像奖提供了一个名人堂级别的复出故事：在《七宝奇谋》(The Goonies)和《夺宝奇兵》(Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom)等电影取得早期成功后，他的演艺生涯陷入低谷，以至于转向了特技工作。“梦想是你必须要相信的东西，”关泪流满面地说，一线明星们起立为他鼓掌。“我差一点放弃了我的。我想对所有人说，不要放弃你的梦想。”

The shares issued by shell companies in the Caymans, Bermuda and other tax havens don’t represent direct ownership of Chinese companies. They’re complex financial structures called variable interest entities that have been engineered to get around the Chinese government’s limits on foreign control of domestic companies. The fear is that the structures don’t give American investors enforceable rights of ownership of the underlying companies.
开曼群岛、百慕大群岛和其他避税港的空壳公司发行的股票并不代表对中国公司的直接所有权。它们是复杂的金融结构，被称为可变利益实体，旨在绕过中国政府对外资控制国内公司的限制。令人担忧的是，这种结构并没有赋予美国投资者对相关公司的可执行所有权。

But if you had been told, back in 2019, that this would be the state of knowledge in 2023, would it not seem extremely weird to you that there has not been a broad public conversation about the wisdom of potentially dangerous virological research in the meantime? That so much more oxygen had been eaten up by partisan theater than by public debate over the policy implications of such a possibility?
但是，假设你在2019年就被告知，这将是2023年的认识水平的话，你难道不会觉得，没有对当时进行的有潜在危险的病毒研究是否明智开展广泛公开的讨论这一点非常奇怪吗？你不会觉得，在这个问题上进行了这么多耗时、耗力的党派争论，而没有对实验室事故引发大流行病可能性的政策影响的公开辩论非常奇怪吗？

And yet, in the political sphere, those most sure of a lab origin aren’t exactly comfortable with the kinds of global governance structures that would probably help protect against future accidents in research abroad. And those committed to defending the principles of science may well be shepherding still riskier work into the world by treating calls for oversight as partisan fearmongering.
不过在政治领域，那些最相信实验室起源说的人不是愿意接受全球治理结构的人，尽管一个全球治理结构可能有助于防止未来的国外研究事故。而那些致力于捍卫科学原则的人，很可能将监管呼吁视为党派斗争在兜售恐惧，从而把更高风险的工作带入世界。

The subject has also proved hard to broach, given that it is also inherently, eye-blurringly technical, on both sides: grant proposals and genome sequences, safety protocols and oversight boards. Researchers and experts quickly grew defensive and dismissive, giving the public an unmistakable sense of an almost unresolvable stalemate early on. 
事实证明也很难讨论这个话题，因为它在本质上具有让讨论双方眼花缭乱的技术性：研究资助申请、基因组序列、安全方案和监督委员会。研究人员和专家们很快采取了防守和不屑一顾的态度，让公众从一开始就明显感觉到，这是个几乎无法解决的僵局。

Finally, there is a peace deal of sorts in the Middle East. Not between Israel and the Arabs, but between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which have been at each other’s throats for decades. And brokered not by the United States but by China. This is among the topsiest and turviest of developments anyone could have imagined, a shift that left heads spinning in capitals around the globe.
中东终于达成了某种和平协议。不是在以色列和阿拉伯国家之间，而是沙特阿拉伯和伊朗，这两个国家几十年来一直针锋相对。此外，协议的达成不是由美国促成，而是中国。大逆转超出了所有人的想象，让各国政府都感到匪夷所思。

MURCHISON FALLS NATIONAL PARK, Uganda — Under dense forest canopy sheltering elephants, rare birds and colobus monkeys, roaring bulldozers and excavators shatter the idyll, toppling ancient trees and carving roads to reach Uganda’s newest source of riches: oil.
乌干达默奇森瀑布国家公园——这片茂密的森林里生活着大象、各种珍稀鸟类和疣猴，现在，轰鸣的推土机和挖掘机打破了宁静，古树被推倒，开挖出的一条条道路通往乌干达的最新财富之源——石油。

Many spoke of still waiting for payment years later, while the pipeline company forbade them from planting vital cash crops like bananas, which pay for food and school fees for their children. They are digging millions of dollars in our land but they don’t want to share it, They are milking the cow without feeding it.Less than half a mile away, gentle waves lapped against the shore where idle fishing boats had been tied.
许多人表示，等了很多年赔付款依旧没到位，管道公司却禁止他们种植香蕉等重要经济作物，从吃饭到孩子的学费原本全指望这些作物。他们在我们的土地上挖走数百万美元，却想独占，他们挤奶却不让牛吃草。数百米之外，温柔的波涛拍打着湖岸，那里停泊着闲置的渔船。

Some protested, but it was futile; under Tanzanian law, all land is public, with the president as trustee, giving the government great latitude to seize it.
有些人抗议，但完全是徒劳的；根据坦桑尼亚法律，所有土地都是公共的，总统是受托人，这让政府可以随心所欲地征用土地。

The project has drawn international opposition. Six Ugandan and French environmental and human rights groups sued TotalEnergies for violating a French law that requires French companies to uphold human rights and environmental protections. The court dismissed the case in late February, citing procedural grounds, but activists vowed to continue fighting TotalEnergies in and out of court.
该项目遭到了国际社会的反对。乌干达和法国的六个环境和人权组织起诉道达尔能源公司违反了法国一项要求法国公司维护人权和环境保护的法律。法院在2月底驳回了此案，理由是程序问题，但活动人士誓言要在法庭内外继续与道达尔能源公司进行斗争。

The pipeline, the longest heated conduit in the world, will straddle the basin of Lake Victoria, which supplies Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya with fresh water. It will traverse a seismically active region to a coastline that has protected marine reserves rich with mangroves and coral reefs. The drilling sites and pipeline will also cut through game reserves and steppes teeming with animals like lions, buffaloes and the endangered Rothschild giraffe that tourists flock to see. 
这条管道是世界上最长的加热管道，横跨为乌干达、坦桑尼亚和肯尼亚提供淡水的维多利亚湖盆地。它将穿越一个地震活跃地区，到达海岸线，那里有包括大量红树林和珊瑚礁的海洋保护区。钻探点和管道还将穿过野生动物保护区和草原，那里有很多动物，如狮子、水牛和濒危的罗斯柴尔德长颈鹿，吸引着众多游人慕名而来。

But even before Ernie’s underwhelming debut, many Chinese wondered why, despite billions of dollars invested by their government and venture capitalists, the nation had not rebounded from its humbling in 2017, when Google’s AlphaGo program beat Jie Ke, the Go champion.
但即便在“文心一言”平平无奇的首次亮相之前，许多中国人就已在思索，为何在政府和风险资本家投入了无数资金的情况下，这个国家依然没能从2017年谷歌的AlphaGo程序击败围棋冠军柯洁的耻辱中扳回一局。s
