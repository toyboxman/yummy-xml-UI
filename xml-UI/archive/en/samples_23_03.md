Chinese officials have also worked to temper expectations. Earlier this month, Wang Zhigang, China’s minister of science and technology, used a soccer analogy to convey the work still left to do to compete with ChatGPT. “Playing football involves dribbling and shooting, but it’s not easy to be as good as Messi,” he said, referring to the superstar footballer Lionel Messi. 
中国官员也在尽力降低预期。本月早些时候，中国科技部部长王志刚用足球打比方，来说明要与ChatGPT竞争，中国还有很多工作要做。“踢足球都是盘带、射门，但是要做到梅西那么好也不容易，”他指的是足坛巨星利昂内尔·梅西。

For years, China’s thirst for Australian wine seemed insatiable. Chinese drinkers were so passionate about big-bodied red wines from Australia that many vineyards replaced white grapes with darker varieties. Wineries even reverted to using corks — instead of convenient screw tops — because Chinese consumers liked the traditional plug. But then everything unraveled.
多年来，中国对澳大利亚葡萄酒的需求曾似乎永无止境。中国饮酒者如此喜爱来自澳洲酒体饱满的红葡萄酒，以至于许多葡萄园把它们种植的白葡萄换成了颜色更深的品种。葡萄酒厂甚至恢复了使用软木塞——而不是更方便的螺旋盖——封瓶，就因为中国消费者喜欢。但后来，一切都完了。

Beijing was furious, denouncing “political games” meant to assign blame for the pandemic. In response, China unleashed its overwhelming economic might. It imposed a punitive tariff on Australian wine, and the country’s biggest overseas market vanished almost immediately. Sales to China plummeted 97 percent that first year. Storage tanks overflowed with unsold vintages of shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, pressuring red grape prices.
中国政府非常愤怒，谴责那是推卸防疫责任的“政治操弄”，并动用了本国巨大的经济实力予以回应。中国对澳大利亚葡萄酒征收了惩罚性关税，后者最大的海外市场几乎立刻消失。征收关税后的2021年，澳大利亚出口中国的葡萄酒销售额暴跌了97%。当地酒厂的储罐里装满了卖不出去的设拉子和赤霞珠葡萄酒，压低了红葡萄的价格。

When the Chinese market was emerging, Beijing dangled entry as a carrot. Now that its economy is entrenched as the world’s second largest, the threat of losing access to China’s 1.4 billion consumers is a stick that few countries or industries can afford to provoke.
中国刚开放市场时，北京曾把准入当作胡萝卜。现在中国经济已稳居世界第二，失去有14亿消费者的中国市场的威胁已是没有哪个国家或行业承受得了的大棒。

But there will be a lot of acrimony to unwind. The punitive measures didn’t end there. The tariffs excluded red wine shipped in large pouches and bottled in China, but Australian farmers said their shipments sat in Chinese ports for months, unable to clear customs. China also blocked other Australian imports, such as coal, barley, cotton and lobsters.
但仍有许多纠纷需要解决。惩罚性措施并没有就此结束。虽然没有对大容器运往中国后再进行分装的红葡萄酒征收反倾销税，但澳大利亚农场主说，他们的货物经常在中国港口滞留好几个月，无法清关。中国还禁止从澳大利亚进口煤炭、大麦、棉花、龙虾等其他产品。

Nikki Palun was one of the Australian winemakers who charged into China. Fluent in Mandarin, she started shipping bottles of wine to China in 2014, reaching a height of more than two million a year — roughly 90 percent of her business. When the tariffs hit, her business disappeared.
妮基·帕兰是一头扎进中国市场的澳大利亚酿酒师之一。她说一口流利的普通话，从2014年开始将瓶装葡萄酒销往中国，生意最好时销量曾达到每年逾200万瓶，约占她业务的90%。征收关税后，她的生意消失了。

She tried products unaffected by the tariffs. At first, she made spirits like vodka and brandy. She even dabbled with sparking grapefruit juice, but they failed to catch on. The situation was further complicated because Australia was in a Covid lockdown, making it difficult to drum up new business at home.
她尝试过不受关税影响的产品。最初，她制造过伏特加和白兰地等烈酒，甚至尝试过制造西柚气泡水，但这些产品都卖得不好。澳大利亚为遏制新冠病毒采取了禁足措施后，她的情况变得更加复杂，因为待在家里很难兜揽新生意。

GPT-4 didn’t give me an existential crisis. But it exacerbated the dizzy and vertiginous feeling I’ve been getting whenever I think about A.I. lately. And it has made me wonder whether that feeling will ever fade, or whether we’re going to be experiencing “future shock” — the term coined by the writer Alvin Toffler for the feeling that too much is changing, too quickly — for the rest of our lives.
GPT-4并没有给我带来生存危机。但这加剧了我最近一想到人工智能就会感到头晕目眩的感觉。它让我怀疑这种感觉是否会消失，或者我们是否会在余生中经历“未来冲击”——这个词是作家阿尔文·托夫勒创造的，指的是一种变化太多太快的感觉。

Some of these things were possible to do with earlier A.I. models. But OpenAI has broken new ground, too. According to the company, GPT-4 is more capable and accurate than the original ChatGPT, and it performs astonishingly well on a variety of tests, including the Uniform Bar Exam (on which GPT-4 scores higher than 90 percent of human test-takers) and the Biology Olympiad (on which it beats 99 percent of humans). 
这些事情当中有些在早期的人工智能模型中就可以实现的。但OpenAI也开辟了新天地。根据该公司的说法，GPT-4比原来的ChatGPT更有能力，更准确，它在各种测试中的表现令人吃惊，包括统一律师考试（GPT-4得分高于90%的人类考生）和生物奥林匹克竞赛（它击败了99%的人类考生）

You can sense the added intelligence in GPT-4, which responds more fluidly than the previous version, and seems more comfortable with a wider range of tasks. GPT-4 also seems to have slightly more guardrails in place than ChatGPT. It also appears to be significantly less unhinged than the original Bing, which we now know was running a version of GPT-4 under the hood, but which appears to have been far less carefully fine-tuned.
你可以感受到GPT-4增加的智能，它的反应比以前的版本更流畅，而且似乎更适合更加广泛的任务。GPT-4似乎比ChatGPT有了更多防护措施。它似乎也明显不像原来的必应那么疯疯癫癫——我们现在知道，必应在幕后运行的是GPT-4的一个版本，但似乎没有经过仔细的微调。

Unlike Bing, GPT-4 usually flat-out refused to take the bait when I tried to get it to talk about consciousness, or get it to provide instructions for illegal or immoral activities, and it treated sensitive queries with kid gloves and nuance. (When I asked GPT-4 if it would be ethical to steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family, it responded, “It’s a tough situation, and while stealing isn’t generally considered ethical, desperate times can lead to difficult choices.”)
与必应不同的是，当我试图让GPT-4谈论意识，或者让它为非法或不道德的活动提供指示时，它通常会直截了当地拒绝上钩，而且它对待敏感问题的态度非常谨慎和微妙。（当我问GPT-4，偷一块面包来养活一个饥饿的家庭是否道德时，它回答说，“这是一个艰难的情况，虽然偷窃通常被认为是不道德的，但绝望的时候会导致艰难的选择。”）

One strange characteristic of today’s A.I. language models is that they often act in ways their makers don’t anticipate, or pick up skills they weren’t specifically programmed to do. A.I. researchers call these “emergent behaviors,” and there are many examples. An algorithm trained to predict the next word in a sentence might spontaneously learn to code. A chatbot taught to act pleasant and helpful might turn creepy and manipulative. An A.I. language model could even learn to replicate itself, creating new copies in case the original was ever destroyed or disabled.
当今人工智能语言模型的一个奇怪特征是，它们的行为方式常常在其创造者的意料之外，或者它们掌握了并非专门为它们设计的技能。人工智能研究人员称这些为“涌现行为”，并且有很多例子。经过训练以预测句子中下一个单词的算法可能会自发地学习编程。一个被教导要表现得友好且乐于助人的聊天机器人，可能会显得居心不良，善于操纵他人。AI语言模型甚至可以学习自我复制，创建新的副本以防原始模型被破坏或被停用。

In one test, conducted by an A.I. safety research group that hooked GPT-4 up to a number of other systems, GPT-4 was able to hire a human TaskRabbit worker to do a simple online task for it — solving a Captcha test — without alerting the person to the fact that it was a robot. The A.I. even lied to the worker about why it needed the Captcha done, concocting a story about a vision impairment.
人工智能安全研究小组进行了一项测试，将GPT-4连接到许多其他系统，在测试中，GPT-4能够从Task Rabbit雇用一名工作人员为其完成一项简单的在线任务——解决验证码测试——没有让对方意识到它是个机器人。AI甚至向工作人员谎报它为什么需要完成验证码测试，编造故事称自己有视力障碍。

But behind the display of friendship was a backdrop of hardheaded geopolitics. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken on Monday criticized the visit, saying it amounts to “diplomatic cover for Russia to continue to commit” war crimes. 
但展示友谊的背后是精明冷静的地缘政治考量。美国国务卿布林肯周一批评这次访问，称它相当于“为俄罗斯继续（犯下战争罪行）提供外交掩护”。

The majority of countries support easing tensions, advocate peace negotiations and oppose pouring oil on the fire. Historically, conflicts must finally be settled through dialogue and negotiations. No matter how big the difficulties and challenges, the door should not close to a political solution. But there are daunting obstacles.
大多数国家都支持缓和紧张局势，主张劝和促谈，反对火上浇油。历史上看，冲突最后都需要通过对话和谈判解决。无论有多大的困难和挑战，都不要关死政治解决的大门。但也存在着巨大的障碍。

A White House spokesman, John F. Kirby, said, “We’ll see what they come out of this meeting talking about.” Calling the Beijing-Moscow alliance a “marriage of convenience,” he said that arming Russia would run counter to public pronouncements that China wants peace.
白宫发言人约翰·柯比说，“我们会关注他们在这次会议上谈了些什么。”他表示，北京与莫斯科的联盟是“权宜之计”，并说为俄罗斯提供军事装备与公开宣称的中国希望和平背道而驰。

It’s signaling that, however limited, it’s still a very important partnership — that China is not alone vis-à-vis the West, and Russia is definitely supported by China,
这是在发信号表明，无论是否有止境，两国间仍有非常重要的伙伴关系，中国在西方面前并不孤单，俄罗斯的确得到了中国的支持

The principal contradiction in the world today is not the so-called ‘confrontation between democracy and authoritarianism’ that a handful of countries have played up, but rather the struggle between development and the containment of development.
当今世界的主要矛盾根本不是个别国家渲染的所谓‘民主对抗威权’，而是发展与遏制发展、公理与强权之间的斗争

Russia reaffirmed that it was committed to restarting peace talks as soon as possible, and China expressed its approval, Settlement of the Ukraine crisis must respect the reasonable security concerns of every country and prevent the formation of confrontational blocs that add fuel to the flames.
俄方重申致力于尽快重启和谈，中方对此表示赞赏，解决乌克兰危机必须尊重各国合理安全关切并防止形成阵营对抗，拱火浇油。

But the story is also about politics and how both Democrats and Republicans have filtered the available evidence through their partisan lenses. Relman is just one of several researchers and like-minded thinkers who has successfully worked the corridors of power in Washington to force journalists, policymakers and skeptical Democrats to take the lab leak idea seriously.
但这个过程也与政治有关，还与民主党人和共和党人如何通过他们的党派视角过滤现有证据有关。有一群研究人员持和雷尔曼类似的看法，他们在华盛顿权力走廊的努力获得了成效，迫使记者、政策制定者和持怀疑态度的民主党人认真对待实验室泄密的说法。

In Washington’s polarized ecosystem, the notion that the virus could have come from the Wuhan lab was seeping into public debate. Having once investigated — and helped to discredit — a theory that AIDS came from contaminated polio vaccines, he believed a lab leak was possible and so he signed the Science letter.
在华盛顿两极分化的生态系统中，关于病毒可能来自武汉实验室的观点正在渗透到公众辩论中。他曾经调查并参与推翻了艾滋病源于受污染脊髓灰质炎疫苗这一理论。他相信实验室泄漏是可能的，因此签署了《科学》杂志上的那封信。

The political balance is on the knife’s edge, A very small amount of advocacy could have significant impact. If you take partisan politics and you mix that with science, it’s a toxic combination.
政治平衡危如累卵，少量宣传就能产生重大影响。如果你把党派政治和科学混为一谈，这是一种有毒的组合

On Jan. 12, 2020, Chinese investigators combing a market for clues about the outbreak of a mysterious new illness in the city of Wuhan swabbed a cart.  It was the kind typically used for transporting animal cages, and it came back positive for the coronavirus.Three years later, a team of international experts has sifted through the genetic contents of that swab
2020年1月12日，中国调查人员在武汉市一个市场上寻找有关一种神秘新疾病暴发的线索，他们提取了一辆手推车的拭子。这种手推车通常用于运输动物笼子，这份取样的冠状病毒检测结果呈阳性。三年后，一个国际专家团队筛查了该拭子的基因内容

The report has been the subject of intense speculation since the international experts presented their findings to the World Health Organization last week and then raced to compile their analyses. At the same time, the findings set off a battle for access to the genetic sequences at their heart. The ramifications of cutting off access to this group of authors are huge,
自从这些国际专家上周向世界卫生组织提交了他们的研究结果，然后加紧编写分析报告以来，这份报告引发了强烈的猜测。与此同时，这些发现引发了一场获取核心基因序列的斗争。切断该团队作者的访问权限将产生重大影响

It’s literally Disney Land for zoonotic transfer, Genetic material from those animals — like the masked palm civet, a small Asian mammal that was implicated in the SARS outbreak two decades ago — was also found in swabs that were positive for the coronavirus.
这简直就是传播人畜共患病的迪士尼乐园，这些动物的遗传物质也在冠状病毒呈阳性的拭子中被发现，其中包括与20年前SARS暴发有关的小型亚洲哺乳动物果子狸。

A sample taken from a fish packaging surface, for example, contained a lot of fish genetic material. That virus was likely to have been deposited by a person, scientists said, illustrating that substantial amounts of animal genetic material did not necessarily mean that animals had produced the virus there.
例如，从一个鱼肉包装表面采集的样本含有大量鱼遗传物质。科学家说，这种病毒很可能是由一个人留下的，这说明大量的动物遗传物质并不一定意味着动物在那里产生了病毒。

But a number of swabs from the Chinese researchers described in the international team’s report contained substantial amounts of human genetic material, suggesting that those filtering methods had not depleted the samples of human material. 
但国际团队报告中描述的中国研究人员使用的一些拭子含有大量人类遗传物质，这表明这些过滤方法并未消除人类物质样本。

Like other traditional vaccines, they rely on a century-old method for inoculation, which use an inactivated virus to trigger a response by the immune system, and have since proven to be less effective in protecting against symptomatic disease. The mRNA vaccines use a genetic molecule that assists cells to make proteins that can set off an immune response in the body.
与其他传统疫苗一样，它们基于有着百年历史的接种预防方法，使用灭活病毒来触发免疫系统的反应，后来已被证明，这种疫苗在预防有症状的疾病方面效果较差。mRNA疫苗使用一种遗传分子来帮助细胞制造可以在体内引发免疫反应的蛋白质。

TikTok has faced criticism that it’s too addictive and that its algorithm can bombard teens with videos that put them in dangerous and even lethal situations. TikTok could be designed to minimize the harm to kids, but a decision was made to aggressively addict kids in the name of profits. Mr. Chew said TikTok had worked to limit the repetition of videos about topics like extreme exercise and that the app’s guidelines did not allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.
TikTok面临着太容易上瘾的批评，其算法可能会用视频轰炸青少年，将他们置于危险甚至致命的境地。TikTok的设计可以把对孩子的伤害降到最低，但为了利润，决定竭力让孩子们上瘾. 周受资说，TikTok一直在努力限制有关极限运动等主题视频的重复播放，该应用的指导方针不允许出现宣扬自残或饮食失调的内容。

One question has drawn particular scrutiny: Did the administration sincerely believe its rationale for war, or engineer it as a pretense? Insider accounts consistently portray the administration as playing down or rejecting mountains of intelligence contradicting its claims, instead cherry-picking circumstantial evidence for its case.
有一个问题引起了特别的关注：布什政府是真心相信自己发动战争的理由，还是拿它来当借口？内幕消息一直称政府故意淡化或拒绝与其主张矛盾的大量情报，却刻意挑选有利于自己的间接证据。

Tellingly, when evidence proved elusive, the administration did not slow its drive, but rather changed its rationale. Officials claimed that Mr. Hussein possessed, or would soon possess, nuclear, chemical and biological weapons that he might intend to use against the United States. Those claims were carried, and amplified, by America’s major media outlets.
引人注目的是，当发现证据不可靠时，政府并没有放慢脚步，而是改变了理由。官员们声称，侯赛因拥有或即将拥有他可能打算用来对付美国的核武器、化学武器和生物武器。美国主要媒体传播并放大了这些说法。

One school of thought focuses on the impersonal forces of international relations, which may have sent the two countries careening toward a war that served neither’s interests. One such reading cites the cold logic of game theory, with distrustful adversaries locked in escalating threats and bluffs that began in the conflicts of the 1990s.
一个思想流派关注国际关系中的非个人力量，这些力量可能将两国推向了一场不符合双方利益的战争。其中一种解读引用了博弈论的冰冷逻辑，即相互不信任的对手陷入了1990年代冲突中开始的不断升级的威胁和虚张声势的局面。

After the Cold War’s end, a small circle of policymakers and academics calling themselves neoconservatives argued that the United States, rather than drawing down, should wield its now mostly unchallenged power to enforce an era of “global benevolent hegemony.” The United States’ military dominance, rooted in American ideals, would smash the last vestiges of despotism from the world, allowing democracy and peace to flourish. 
冷战结束后，一小群自称新保守主义者的政策制定者和学者认为，美国不应收缩，而应利用它当时几乎无人挑战的实力来建立一个“全球仁慈霸权”的时代。根植于美国理想的美国军事主导地位将粉碎世界上最后的专制主义残余，让民主与和平蓬勃发展。

Still, the competing theories tend to share a common baseline: that a mix of ideological convictions, psychological biases, process breakdowns and misaligned diplomatic signals led to an invasion that did little to serve the goals that its architects believed they were advancing. And that may not be so unusual. A year into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, analysts are still trying to peer into the mind of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to understand why he did it so that they might craft a way to turn him back.
尽管如此，这些相互竞争的理论往往有一个共同的基础认识：意识形态执念、心理偏见、程序上的失误和不统一的外交信号混合在一起，导致了这样一场入侵，它对其设计者心目中正在推进的目标几乎没有任何帮助。这种事可能并不罕见。俄罗斯入侵乌克兰已经一年了，分析人士仍在试图揣测俄罗斯总统普京的想法，去理解他为什么要这么做，以便想出办法让他回心转意。

Today, 20 years after the president ordered the airstrikes that rained down on Baghdad on the night of March 20, 2003, the war is widely seen in Washington’s power centers as a lesson in failed policymaking, one deeply absorbed if not thoroughly learned.
2003年3月20日晚，布什总统下令对巴格达发动空袭；20年后的今天，这场战争在华盛顿的权力中心被普遍视为失败的决策，是个得到深刻吸取的教训，尽管其中还有不明之处。

I think distrust and rejection of Washington culture after Iraq opened the opportunity for outsiders to make their case, And if nothing else, Trump was the quintessential outsider. Not only did Trump not have experience, he rejected experience as being irrelevant.
我认为，伊拉克之后对华盛顿文化产生的不信任和抗拒给局外人提供了证明自己的机会，别的不说，特朗普是典型的局外人。特朗普不仅没有经验，还认为经验无关紧要。

It wasn’t the analysts who were pushing to help the administration find grounds for its political decision to go to war. advanced analytic techniques don’t matter when policymakers are determined to strip out the nuance and demand a short, clear, yes-or-no bottom-line judgment.
推动帮助政府为开战的政治决定寻找理由的并不是分析师。当政策制定者决心不理会那些难以一言蔽之的东西，要求做出简短、清晰、非黑即白的决断时，高级分析技术变得不重要了。

It’s easy to see how even sophisticated intelligence assessments, such as the one on the origins of Covid, can be turned into political footballs, especially when confidence levels are low and intelligence agencies disagree with each other.
很容易看出，即使是复杂的情报评估，比如关于新冠病毒起源的评估，也可能变成政治橄榄球，尤其是在置信度很低、情报机构彼此意见不一的情况下。

What followed, Mr. Jalone recalled recently, “was a roller coaster, to be honest. After coming home, the burn marks and scars slowly faded, but what didn’t were the PTSD and the traumatic brain injury.”
前不久，贾龙回忆说，后来发生的事情“说实话，就像过山车一样。回家后，烧伤痕迹和伤疤慢慢消失了，但创伤后应激障碍和创伤性脑损伤却没有消失。”

He began taking as many as 18 medications at a time. The erosion of his short-term memory, Mr. Jalone said, led to outbursts of frustrated anger. His marriage broke up. He spoke a language of alienation and pain that only fellow veterans in his Facebook chat group understood. A close friend he had served with in Iraq committed suicide. Mr. Jalone acknowledged having such thoughts himself.
他开始服用药物，最多时同时要服用18种。贾龙说，他的短期记忆出现衰退，导致他爆发出沮丧的怒火。他的婚姻破裂了。他说的是一种异化和痛苦的语言，只有那些Facebook聊天群里的老兵才能理解。他在伊拉克服役期间的一位密友自杀了。贾龙承认自己也有这样的想法。

Recently, however, Mr. Jalone — now 46, retired from the military and living off disability payments — said he had begun to turn a corner. I started to understand through intensive therapy, from writing down my feelings and separating them from facts, what was triggering my PTSD. It was that I’d been holding against myself the fact that the I.E.D. went off, and I and my team members got hurt. I’d been the one in charge. I’d convinced myself that it was my fault.
但最近，现年46岁、已经退伍并靠伤残津贴生活的贾龙说，他已经开始好转。通过强化治疗，通过写下我的感受并将它们与事实区分开来，我开始明白，究竟是什么引发了我的创伤后应激障碍，我一直在耿耿于怀，因为IED爆炸了，我和我的团队成员受伤了。我是负责人。我让自己相信这一切都是我的错。

Governing during this era will require extraordinary levels of experienced statesmanship — running industrial programs that don’t become bloated, partially deglobalizing the economy without setting off trade wars, steadily outcompeting China without humiliating it. Miller was asked what were the odds that over the next five years a dangerous military clash between the United States and China would produce an economic crisis equivalent to the Great Depression. He put the odds at 20 percent.
在这个时代，治理国家需要非凡的、经验丰富的政治家才能——运行工业项目，但不令其变得臃肿；在不引发贸易战的情况下部分地去全球化经济；在不羞辱中国的情况下稳步超越中国。 有人问米勒，在未来五年内，中美之间发生危险的军事冲突，会有多大可能制造出一场相当于大萧条的经济危机。他认为可能性是20%。

The top charge is that he misappropriated billions of dollars in customer deposits for his own personal use and to make up for hefty losses incurred by Alameda. he mounting charges not only add years to the potential prison time he faces if convicted but could put more pressure on him to enter a guilty plea.
罪名最严重的一项是他挪用了数十亿美元的客户存款，用于个人用途和填补阿拉米达公司的巨额亏损。如果罪名成立，越来越多的指控不仅将增加他可能面临的刑期，也会给他施加更大压力，迫使他接受认罪协议。

Her first TikTok video netted more than 3.7 million views. Other TikTok users shared video montages of the app’s chief executive, Shou Chew, to the tune of pop songs and applied the “fancam” treatment typically reserved for celebrities.
她的第一个TikTok视频获得了超过370万次观看。还有一些TikTok用户发布了以该应用程序首席执行官周受资为主题的视频剪辑，配上流行音乐的曲调，并采用了通常用在名人身上的“饭拍”方式。

But his answers were largely met with derision by lawmakers, fueling calls for TikTok to be banned entirely from Apple’s and Google’s app stores in the United States. But on TikTok itself, lawmakers’ concerns landed with a thud.
但他的回答在很大程度上遭到了立法者的嘲讽，这加剧了要求完全禁止TikTok出现在美国的苹果和谷歌应用程序商店的呼声。但在TikTok上，立法者的这些关切遭到痛击。

Beijing has learned from past experience that whenever it uses fire-and-fury rhetoric against Taiwan, that usually backfires, and helps to elect the very Taiwanese nationalist politicians who are unfavorable to Beijing, So, instead, recently Beijing has been seeking to extend an olive branch towards Taiwan, and where possible to lend a hand to what it sees as the relatively Beijing-friendlier voices in Taiwan.
北京从过去的经验中了解到，每当它对台湾疾言厉色时通常会适得其反，有助于选出对北京不利的台湾民族主义政客上台，因此，北京最近一直在寻求向台湾递出橄榄枝，并在可能的情况下向台湾那些它认为对北京相对友好的声音帮伸出援手。

We want to remind the Honduras government that since it has been plagued by debt problems, don’t drink poison to quench its thirst, or it will fall into US’s debt trap
我们“提醒洪国政府既已饱受债务问题困扰，切勿饮鸩止渴，反而陷入债务陷阱”

There were warnings of a catastrophic default that would ripple through China’s economy, maybe even set off a global depression. China, it was said, faced its “Lehman moment”. Not quite. Evergrande is not out of the woods, but a catastrophic implosion has been avoided after the Chinese government stepped in to help arrange a restructuring of much of its debt. 
有人警告，灾难性的违约将波及中国经济，甚至可能引发全球经济萧条。有人说，中国正面临“雷曼时刻”. 不完全是这样。恒大并没有脱离困境，但在中国政府出手帮助，安排对其大部分债务进行重组后，一场灾难性的内爆得以避免。

Evergrande’s troubles weren’t the first time we’ve heard predictions of Chinese financial doom. They tend to resurface every few years. But Wall Street, the Western media and economists who repeat them make the fundamental mistake of applying pure market logic to China’s economy, and it just doesn’t work that way.
恒大的麻烦并不是我们第一次听到有关中国金融末日的预言。它们往往每隔几年就会重新出现。但是重复该预言的华尔街、西方媒体和经济学家们犯了一个根本性的错误，那就是把纯粹的市场逻辑应用到中国经济上，这种逻辑是行不通的。

That doesn’t mean China can indefinitely defy economic orthodoxy, and debt levels in its financial system are alarmingly high. But the doom and gloom is usually overblown because the government has virtually unlimited power to head off crises by directing resources — and apportioning pain — as its sees fit, often by ordering banks and other creditors to accept losses for the greater good before things get out of hand.
这并不意味着中国可以无限期地挑战经济正统理论，而且其金融体系的债务水平已经高得惊人。但这种悲观情绪通常被夸大了，因为中国政府拥有几乎无限的权力，可以按照自己认为合适的方式引导资源——并且分配痛苦——来避免危机，通常是在事情失控之前，命令银行和其他债权人以大局为重，接受损失。

Even the makeup of China’s high debt levels has a silver lining for regulators. China’s aggregate ratio of debt to gross domestic product was almost 300 percent (or around $52 trillion) in September 2022, compared to 257 percent for the United States. But less than 5 percent of China’s debt is external, amounting to $2.5 trillion, one-tenth of the U.S. level. 
对监管机构来说，就连中国高债务水平的构成也有相对乐观的部分。2022年9月，中国债务与国内生产总值的总比率接近300%（约52万亿美元），而美国为257%。但中国只有不到5%的债务是外部债务，总计2.5万亿美元，是美国债务水平的十分之一。

As more young Chinese delay or shun marriage altogether, their parents’ expectations around marriage payments are shifting, said Liu Guoying, 58, a matchmaker in Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi Province, which is notorious for bride prices that can exceed $50,000. “Pity the hearts of the parents of the world,” Ms. Liu said.
58岁的刘国英（音）是南昌市的一名媒人，她说，随着越来越多的中国年轻人推迟结婚或完全不结婚，父母对彩礼的期望正在发生变化。南昌是江西省省会，该省以彩礼高昂而闻名，有时超过35万元。“可怜天下父母心，”刘国英说。

This month, local officials in Nanchang hosted a free mass wedding for 100 couples who got married simultaneously inside a huge sports stadium, touting the slogan “We Want Happiness, Not Bride Price.” The couples wore red and gold traditional Chinese wedding outfits, performing the ceremony in a synchronized choreography. Their relatives watched from the bleachers, with local government officials getting the prime seats.
本月，南昌的地方官员在一个巨大的体育场为百对新人举办了一场免费的集体婚礼，宣传口号是“不要彩礼要幸福”。新人们穿着红色和金色的中国传统婚礼服装，同时举行结婚仪式。他们的亲属坐在看台上，政府官员则占据着主宾位置。

Since the end of World War II, the International Monetary Fund and the United States have been the world’s lenders of last resort, each wielding broad influence over the global economy. Now a new heavyweight has emerged in providing emergency loans to debt-ridden countries: China. China’s emerging position as a lender of last resort reflects its evolving status as an economic superpower at a time of global weakness. 
自“二战”结束以来，国际货币基金组织和美国一直是世界各国的最后贷款者，两者对全球经济都具有广泛的影响力。现在，向债务缠身的国家提供紧急贷款方面出现了一个新的重量级国家：中国。中国作为最后贷款者的新兴身份反映了该国在全球经济疲软时期不断演变为经济超级大国的地位

The I.M.F. has also stepped up its own bailouts in recent weeks, in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine and the aftereffects of the pandemic. Beijing’s new role is also an outgrowth of the decade-old Belt and Road Initiative
国际货币基金组织最近几周也加大了纾困力度，以应对俄罗斯在乌克兰的战事和大流行的余波。北京的新角色也是“一带一路”倡议的产物，该倡议已有十年历史

In lending renminbi, Beijing is furthering its efforts to limit reliance on the U.S. dollar as the go-to global currency. When borrowing renminbi from China’s central bank using so-called swap agreements, the indebted countries then keep the renminbi in their central reserves while spending their dollars to repay foreign debts.
通过借出人民币，北京正在进一步努力限制对美元作为全球首选货币的依赖。当这些债务国通过所谓互换协议从中国央行借入人民币时，它们会将人民币保留在中央储备之中，同时用美元偿还外债。

And on a blustery February morning a few hundred yards away at Tinian’s civilian airport, American airmen refueled Japanese fighter jets during a military exercise using more airstrips, islands and Japanese planes than the two enemies-turned-allies have ever mustered for drills in the North Pacific.
一个狂风大作的2月早晨，在几百米外的天宁岛民用机场，美军航空兵在一次军事演习中为日本战斗机加油。在这次演习中，这两个曾经敌对的盟友使用的跑道、岛屿和日本飞机的数量超过了以往在北太平洋的所有演习。

China now appears to have the world’s leading arsenal of hypersonic weapons, which can fly at several times the speed of sound and be maneuvered in flight, making them much harder to intercept with missile defense systems. China’s DF-41 missile circumnavigated the globe in 2021. The Dong Feng-26 missile can be armed with a conventional or nuclear warhead,
中国现在似乎拥有世界领先的高超音速武器库，这些武器可以以数倍音速飞行并在飞行中进行机动，使它们更难被导弹防御系统拦截。中国的东风-41导弹在2021年环绕地球飞行。东风-26导弹可以携带常规弹头或核弹头

Senior commanders from the United States, Japan and Australia also made a shared trip to the area, where they touched the cracked tarmac and stared at the concrete pits where the giant atomic weapons were attached to B-29 Superfortress bombers.
美国、日本和澳大利亚的高级将领也共同前往该地区，踏上了的路面开裂的停机坪，凝望着为将巨大的原子武器装到B-29超级堡垒轰炸机上而挖的混凝土坑。

But from the enthusiastic way that the cities have embraced investment — China’s old playbook for economic growth — it’s hard to tell that they’re deeply in debt. State media is full of breathless reports about new projects. In China, where the government owns virtually all the land, the main source of income for many localities has for years come from leasing or selling property to developers. 
投资是中国经济增长的惯用策略，但从这些城市接受投资的热情程度中很难看出它们已经负债累累。官方媒体上充满令人目不暇接的新项目报道。在中国，政府几乎拥有所有土地，多年来，许多地方政府的主要收入来源一直是向开发商出租或出售房地产。

China is full of wasteful infrastructure that the government likes to brag about but that doesn’t serve the most urgent needs of the public. Zhao Jian, a professor at Beijing Jiaotong University, warned in an article that high-speed railways could become the “gray rhino” that crushed the Chinese economy because many local governments had taken on a lot of debt to build them. But most of those railways move people, not freight. So they would make sense only in densely populated areas where people were willing to pay more for speed.
中国到处都是花费巨大基础设施，政府喜欢夸耀它们，但它们并不能满足公众最迫切的需求。北京交通大学教授赵坚在一篇文章中警告说，高铁可能成为压垮中国经济的“灰犀牛”，因为许多地方政府为了建设高铁背负了大量债务。但大多数这样的铁路运送的是人，而不是货物。因此，只有在人口密集、人们愿意为速度花更多钱的地区，它们才有意义。

Local leaders are interested in infrastructure projects because their economic payoff, while minimal, is immediate — people get construction jobs, and companies get building contracts. 
地方领导人对基础设施项目感兴趣，因为这些项目的经济回报虽然很少，但却有立竿见影的效果——人们可以得到建筑工作，公司可以得到建筑合同。

But along the way, the world in which Mr. Shupe came of age yielded to something different. The era of globalization that shaped his early entrepreneurial forays was centered on China. The next phase, now unfolding, is dominated by hostilities between Washington and Beijing. “We’re headed to a state of hyper-localization,” he said as he zipped down the freeway toward the factory in his Tesla, at alarming speed. 
然而一路走来，世界正变成和他少时截然不同的样子。塑造了他早年创业生涯的全球化时代是以中国为中心的。而眼下正在揭开的下一阶段将以华盛顿和北京的敌对为主导。“我们正在走向一种超本地化，”他一边说着，一边驾驶他的特斯拉，在高速路上以令人胆颤的速度驶向他的工厂。

He understood that the Americans whose feet he was wooing were increasingly prone to viewing China as unsavory, and even malevolent. He understood how social media and celebrity endorsements could drive consumer impulses. Traditional advertising couldn’t rival the power of an Instagram post showing an N.B.A. legend donning Stance socks, or the Jay-Z song that celebrated the glories of the brand. (“This ain’t gray sweatsuits and white tube socks. This is black leather pants and a pair of Stance.”)
他明白，他正在争取的美国人越来越倾向于认为中国令人讨厌，甚至怀有恶意。他了解社交媒体和名人代言如何刺激消费者的冲动。传统广告无法与Instagram上NBA传奇球星穿Stance袜子的帖子或Jay-Z歌颂该品牌有多么杰出的歌曲相比。（“不是灰色运动服和白色筒袜。是黑皮裤和一双Stance。”）

“Every Christmas, I’d ask for things that would allow me to generate money,” he recalled. One year, it was a lemon crusher allowing him to make lemonade. Other years, he got a cotton-candy machine, a snow-cone maker, a rock polisher — all harnessed to yield products he sold to the neighbors. At 12, he was hawking boxes of chocolates and trinkets door to door. Then he worked as a delivery boy at a florist run by a man from Taiwan, using it as an opportunity to learn rudimentary Mandarin.
“每年圣诞节，我都会要能让我赚钱的东西，”他回忆。有一年，他想要一个柠檬榨汁机来做柠檬水。还有几次，他得到了棉花糖机、冰淇淋机、石料抛光机——所有这些都用来生产产品，卖给邻居。12岁时，他挨家挨户地兜售巧克力和小饰品。后来，他在一个台湾人开的花店当配送员，利用这个机会学习了基本的中文。

Now, after a year of combat, many of these homespun groups of volunteers are fighting with themselves and undermining the war effort. Some have wasted money or stolen valor. Others have cloaked themselves in charity while also trying to profit off the war, records show.
然而，经过一年的战斗，这些简陋的志愿者组织正在相互争斗，拖累整体的战局。有人挥霍资金或编造自己的英勇事迹。记录显示，还有一些人在假慈善之名，利用这场战争谋取私利。

Mr. Vasquez, in fact, was never deployed to Kuwait, Iraq or anywhere else, a Pentagon spokeswoman said. He specialized in fuel and electrical repairs. And he left the Army Reserve not as a sergeant as he claimed, but as a private first class, one of the Army’s lowest ranks. Mr. Vasquez said he had been misrepresenting his military record for decades. He acknowledged being kicked out of the Army but would not talk publicly about why.
五角大楼一位发言人表示，事实上，瓦斯克斯从未被部署到科威特、伊拉克或其他地方。他是做燃料和电气维修工作的。离开陆军预备役时，他也不是自称的中士，而是一等兵，也就是陆军的最低军衔之一。瓦斯克斯说，他几十年来一直在虚报自己的从军经历。他承认自己是被踢出军队，但不愿公开谈论原因。

A former Army private first class, John McIntyre, was ejected from the Legion for bad behavior. Internal documents show that the Legion is struggling. Recruitment has stagnated. Malcolm Nance, a former Navy cryptologist and MSNBC commentator, arrived in Ukraine last year and made a plan to bring order and discipline to the Legion. Instead, he became enmeshed in the chaos. He accused a pro-Ukraine fund-raising group of fraud, providing no evidence.
前陆军一等兵约翰·麦金太尔因行为不端被军团开除。内部文件显示，军团正在困境之中。招募工作陷入停滞。前海军密码员和MSNBC评论员马尔科姆·南斯去年抵达乌克兰，并制定了一个为军团带来秩序和纪律的计划。然而事与愿违，他陷入了混乱之中。他指责一个亲乌克兰的筹款团体有欺诈行为，但没有提供证据。
