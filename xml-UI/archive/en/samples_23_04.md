In mid-January, NetEase contractors destroyed the World of Warcraft ax sculpture. As the contractors swung hammers at it, employees livestreamed the demolition to 30,000 people. NetEase said local law required it to clear out another company’s intellectual property after the partnership was terminated.
1月中旬，网易雇用的施工队拆除了魔兽斧头雕塑。公司雇员直播了工人挥舞锤子拆雕塑的过程，有30000人收看。网易称法律规定当合作关系解除时，需要清除另一方的知识资产。

That path, fueled by bravado, ruthlessness, a keen political antenna and alleged theft, has left lingering suspicion about his allegiances. And it has now taken him from his Manhattan penthouse to his new place of residence: the Brooklyn federal detention center.
推动他在这条道路上疾驰的，是虚张声势、冷酷无情、敏锐的政治触角和据称的盗窃行为，这一切令人对他究竟效忠于谁产生了挥之不去的疑虑。如今，沿着这条道路，他从曼哈顿的顶层公寓来到了新的住所：布鲁克林联邦拘留中心。

It was the Year of the Tiger, my Chinese zodiac sign, when tradition says that ill fortune will seek you out. Red underwear is supposed to keep you safe because Chinese demons supposedly fear the color red. It didn’t work.
去年是中国的虎年，按照十二生肖也是我的本命年，传统说法说厄运会找上门来。红色内衣辟邪，因为据说中国的魔鬼怕红色。我照做了，但不管用。

From Shanghai, the idea seems absurd. The city’s people are immersed in American culture, having grown up using iPhones, sipping Starbucks coffee, following the N.B.A. and polishing their colloquial English by watching “Friends” (there’s even a “Friends”-themed cafe in Shanghai, designed to look like the sitcom’s coffee shop, Central Perk).
从上海这边看，新冷战的想法似乎很荒谬。生活在上海的人沉浸在美国文化中，从小到大接触的是iPhone、星巴克咖啡和NBA赛事，有些人通过看美剧《老友记》(Friends)来提高英文口语水平，（上海甚至有一家以《老友记》为主题的咖啡馆，里面的设计看上去就像是这部情景喜剧里的咖啡馆Central Perk）

Some leading intellectuals tell me that they resent Chinese online influencers and social-media nationalists for the same reason I dislike Fox News: They’re opportunists, weakening their country with lies. The United States has been a lodestar for China throughout its reform era, which began in the late 1970s and continues to transform the country.
一些最杰出的知识分子告诉我，他们厌恶中国网络上的那些大V和社交媒体民族主义者，原因与我不喜欢福克斯新闻的原因相同：那些人是机会主义者，用谎言来削弱自己的国家。在中国的整个改革开放时期，美国一直是指路明灯，中国的改革开放始于20世纪70年代后期，仍在继续改变着这个国家。

The United States can badger China about its flaws all it wants. But is our ultimate goal to score political points or to live in a peaceful world where we cooperate on real problems like climate change? America is strongest when it leads by example, by remaining open, generous and free.
美国在指责中国的缺点上想怎样做都行。但我们的最终目标是在政治上挫败对手，还是生活在一个和平的世界里，让我们能够就气候变化等实际问题进行合作？美国应该保持开放、宽宏大量和自由，只有以身作则，才最强大。

In 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant was arrested by a police officer for speeding in his horse-drawn coach in Washington. The officer stuck out his hand to signal a stop, and Grant obeyed and then accompanied the officer to the police station. Did that demean the presidency? No, I’d say it was a beautiful tribute to democracy. What was unthinkable for the French Sun King, Louis XIV —“L’état, c’est moi” (“I am the state”) — is appropriate in a system of equality before the law.
1872年，尤利西斯·S·格兰特总统在华盛顿因驾驶马车超速被警察逮捕。警察伸手示意停车，格兰特服从指示，然后与对方一道去了警局。此事是否有损总统身份？不，我倒认为这是对民主的美好致敬。在宣称“朕即国家”的法国太阳王路易十四看来不可想象之事，在法律面前人人平等的制度下是理所应当。

As a teenager, I was outraged when President Gerald Ford pre-emptively pardoned former President Richard Nixon, yet over time I came to think that it was the right call and allowed the country to heal. Yet one difference is obvious: Nixon in 1974 was already completely discredited, ostracized and broken, while Trump denies any wrongdoing and is running again for the White House.
杰拉尔德·福特总统先行赦免了前总统理查德·尼克松，曾让十几岁的我愤愤不平。但随着时间推移，我开始相信这是正确的决定，因为它让这个国家得以愈合。但这里有一个明显的区别：1974年的尼克松已经声名扫地、遭到排斥、一蹶不振，而特朗普拒不认错，还要再次竞选总统。

For all of the focus on the tawdry details of the case or its novel legal theory or its political impact, the larger story is of a country heading down a road it has never traveled before, one fraught with profound consequences for the health of the world’s oldest democracy. For more than two centuries, presidents have been held on a pedestal, even the ones swathed in scandal, declared immune from prosecution while in office and, effectively, even afterward. No longer. That taboo has been broken. A new precedent has been set. 
此案的种种粗鄙的细节及其涉及的新奇法律理论和政治影响承载了所有关注的目光，但它更广泛的意义还在于，一个国家就这样踏上了从未涉足之路，这将对世界最古老的民主政体的兴衰产生深远影响。两百多年来，总统之位神圣不可侵犯，即便深陷丑闻，总统也能在任职期间——甚至卸任以后——免于起诉。历史先例不再适用。这一禁忌已被打破。新的先例已经确立。

Given that the defendant has been involved in far more earth-shattering events like trying to overturn an election. Whether the indictment is warranted or not, it crosses a huge line in American politics and American legal history, If that were not enough to shake the timbers of the republic, the first may not be the last. There is consternation that the barrier-shattering indictment would involve something as unseemly as paying hush money to cover up a sexual romp. 
考虑到被告人曾经参与的那些更为惊天动地的事件——试图推翻选举, 无论起诉理由是否适当，这都是美国政治及美国法制史上一次意义重大的突破，暂不论这是否足以动摇共和国的根基，破天荒的起诉或许不会到此为止。让人始料未及的是，这场打破藩篱的起诉涉及支付封口费掩盖桃色丑闻这种不体面的事体。

While the indictment of Mr. Trump takes the country into uncharted waters, the authors of the Constitution might have been surprised only that it took so long. not least because this indictment is being brought by a local prosecutor rather than the Justice Department, opening the door to prosecutors around the country taking it upon themselves to go after a president.
虽然起诉特朗普让这个国家面临未知，但宪法起草者们大概只会对起诉如此姗姗来迟感到惊讶。尤其是因为，这次起诉是由一名地方检察官而不是司法部提出的，这为全国各地的检察官自行追究总统责任打开了大门。

In Italy, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Just last month, he was acquitted on charges of bribing witnesses at a previous underage prostitution trial. Other leaders of democratic nations convicted in recent years include former Presidents Jacques Chirac (embezzlement) and Nicolas Sarkozy (influence peddling) in France, former President Park Geun-hye (corruption) in South Korea and former President Chen Shui-bian (bribery) in Taiwan.
在意大利，前总理西尔维奥·贝卢斯科尼,他曾经涉及一起未成年人卖淫案，被指控贿赂证人，上个月，法院裁定他无罪获释。近年来被定罪的其他民主领导人包括法国前总统雅克·希拉克（挪用公款）和尼古拉·萨科齐（以权谋私）、韩国前总统朴槿惠（腐败）和陈水扁（受贿）。

He wasn’t forgiving Nixon so much as he was trying to forget him, That is, to counter the popular, political and media obsession that, quite understandably, had formed around the previously unthinkable concept of an American president facing jail time. And the existence of which prevented him from doing his job or the American people from moving on to confront all the problems that Nixon left behind him.
与其说他宽恕尼克松，不如说他试图忘记尼克松，也就是说，是为了抵制大众、政治和媒体的痴迷，可以理解的是，这种痴迷是围绕着一个美国总统面临牢狱之灾这个以前不可想象的概念而形成的。这种情况的存在让他无法做他该做的事情，也让美国人难以翻过这一页，去正视和处理尼克松留下的所有问题。

Mr. Trump’s lawyers might also seek to have the case moved to another court, another long-shot motion known as a change of venue. The former president has written repeatedly on Truth Social, the social network that he founded, that he does not believe he can get a fair trial in Manhattan, a liberal enclave where he is deeply unpopular. He suggested the trial be moved to the far more conservative borough of Staten Island.
特朗普的律师团队可能还会寻求将案件转移至其他法院，即改变庭审地点，这也是一项难以成功的动议。这位前总统曾多次在他创建的社交网络“真实社交”上写道，他不相信自己能在曼哈顿得到公平的审判。曼哈顿是一块自由派飞地，他在那里非常不受欢迎。他建议将审判转移到更为保守的斯塔滕岛。

In New York, falsifying business records can amount to a crime, albeit a misdemeanor. To elevate the crime to a felony charge, Mr. Bragg’s prosecutors must show that Mr. Trump’s “intent to defraud” included an intent to commit or conceal a second crime.
在纽约，伪造商业记录可能构成犯罪，但只属于轻罪。要将其上升为重罪，布拉格手下的检察官必须证明特朗普的“欺诈意图”包括实施或隐瞒二次犯罪的意图。

I had the impression as if two people are quarreling with each other, So this ambivalence signifies that Europe has not formulated a coherent policy toward China. But Mr. Fu welcomed her statement that the bloc should “de-risk” its relationship with China by setting new ground rules rather than “decoupling” or withdrawing. We are open to suggestions if they think that if China does one thing, and we’ll be able to do another, well let’s talk about this, and we’ll be happy to explore all avenues
给我的感觉就好像是两个人在争论，因此，这种矛盾姿态说明欧洲还没有拿出一套连贯的对华政策。但傅聪支持了她的说法，即欧盟应该制定新的基本规则为对华关系“去风险”，而不是“脱钩”或撤出。如果他们觉得中国迈出一步，自己才能迈出另一步，那我们愿意考虑，也可以探讨，我们很乐意探索各种办法

In saying this, Mr. Fu hit on an open question in E.U. policymaking circles: had Europe drawn too close to the U.S. after their deep alignment over supporting Ukraine, and did this now pose a risk of Europe not acting in its own interests vis-à-vis China?
傅聪此言切中了欧盟政策制定层一个悬而未决的问题：在支持乌克兰的问题上取得深刻共识后，欧洲是否与美国走得太近，而这是否又让欧洲在中国问题上面临不顾自身利益的风险？

The hunters waded into the water after dark, their headlamps beaming as they tossed nets into the crashing waves over and over again. All night, they shook muck from the nets, sorting out their prizes: wriggling, transparent baby eels, each no thicker than a vermicelli noodle. They were worth their weight in gold, or nearly. The fishermen dropped them into jars of water, which some of them hung around their necks on string.
天黑后，捕捞者戴着强光头灯涉水而下，一遍又一遍地在汹涌的海浪中撒网。整个晚上，他们都在抖落渔网里的淤泥，挑出其中的宝贝：蠕动的透明鳗苗，一条还不如一根粉丝粗。它们的价值相当或接近于同等重量的黄金。渔民将其放入水罐，有些人还用绳子将罐子挂在脖子上。

Professor Han said that while global warming’s effects on eels had not been closely studied, fishermen in Taiwan think that changes in temperature affect the tides that bring in their catch. The warmer the seawater is, the lower the fish would swim, which makes them harder to catch
韩玉山表示，虽然全球变暖对鳗鱼的影响还未得到仔细研究，但台湾渔民认为，温度变化会影响潮汐，从而影响他们的渔获。海水越暖，鱼就会越往深处游，导致捕捉难度更大

She is a rare woman in a male-dominated industry. On a winter evening, she strode the floor of her plant in galoshes, talking to clients on the phone and occasionally dipping her arms into vats, to catch the slithering eels and sort them into streams.
在这个由男性主导的行业中，她是罕有的女性。在一个冬天的夜晚，她穿着套鞋在工厂里大步流星，和客户打电话，偶尔把手伸进池中抓住游动的鳗鱼，将其分类放入管道。

Eventually, the frugality and hustle led to a grander lifestyle. Ms. Kuo now drives a convertible and has been profiled in Taiwanese media (which dubbed her “the eel queen.”) She once appeared on a Japanese television show to cook samples of her product for a panel of judges.
最终，这样的勤俭换来了富贵的生活。郭琼英如今的座驾是一辆敞篷车，台湾媒体报道她的生平（还称她为“鳗鱼女王”）。她曾做客一档日本电视节目，为评委们烹饪她的产品样品。

In the early 1990s, a sprawling petrochemical plant went up there. Smoke and steam rise from its many chimneys, blanketing the nearby grass with white dust. He said the harvest has never been the same. Chiang Kai-te, 43, a part-time construction worker, had spent many years working odd jobs when a friend’s success convinced him to try eel fishing. “It’s hard to cash in,” said Mr. Chiang, slumped on the ground from exhaustion. “My whole family relies on me.” He said he was on the verge of quitting. I don’t think it’s sustainable to keep doing this
上世纪90年代初，当地建起了一座巨型石油化工厂。大量烟囱排放出烟雾和蒸汽，附近的草地都被白灰覆盖。他说，捕捞的收获再也不复当初了。43岁的蒋凯德是一名兼职建筑工，多年来一直在打零工，直到有位朋友成功劝说他尝试以捞鳗为生。“很难赚到钱，”蒋凯德说，他筋疲力尽地倒在地上。“全家人都指望我。”他说自己快要放弃这一行了。我想这么下去早晚无以为继

But the French leader likes to thread needles invisible to others. He appears to detect enough Chinese disquiet over Mr. Putin’s war for diplomatic ingenuity. The United States has been dismissive of any Chinese role in Ukrainian peacemaking. It waved away a vague 12-point Chinese plan put forward in February. 
但这位法国领导人喜欢另辟蹊径走出困境。他似乎察觉到中国对普京的战争已足够地忧虑，让他能在外交上有所独创。美国一直对中国在和平解决乌克兰战争上的作用不屑一提，对它在2月份提出的12条含糊立场置之不理。

it is neither viable — nor in Europe’s interest — to decouple from China. Our relations are not black or white — and our response cannot be either. This is why we need to focus on de-risk — not decouple. China has now turned the page on the era of ‘reform and opening’ and is moving into a new era of security and control.
与中国脱钩既不可行，也不符合欧洲利益。我们的关系不是非黑即白，我们的响应也不能是非黑即白。这就是为什么我们需要将重点放在去风险上——而不是脱钩。中国现在已经翻过了‘改革开放’时代的那页，正在进入一个以国家安全和控制为主的新时代。

“Not only is there no criteria known to pass it, there’s not a specific end game that’s ever been articulated if you don’t pass it,” she said. That could have a chilling effect. “Many companies are now having a come to Jesus moment,” Ms. Sacks said. “Is it worth the cost now to be in this incredibly difficult market?”
“不仅没有已知的通过标准，如果不通过会怎样，也没有明确的说明，”她说。这可能会产生寒蝉效应。“许多公司现在都在经历一个幡然醒悟的时刻，”萨克斯说。“它们在思考，如今，费尽周章就为了待在这个异常艰难的市场，是否值得？”

After three years of conducting business in Asia virtually — via video calls, digital conferences, even holograms — Swiss watch executives have travel on the brain. We’re organizing a lot of dinners with collectors and clients. We have to celebrate a few boutique openings that we couldn’t celebrate during Covid. I want to do a ribbon cutting. Mr. Tornare, like many of his fellow executives, is eager to make up for lost time in Asia. 
在过去三年里，瑞士钟表品牌的高管们一直通过视频通话、数字会议甚至全息影像等虚拟方式在亚洲开展业务，现在他们急于亲临市场一线。我们会安排大量晚宴，跟藏家和客户见面。还要为几家精品店的开业举行庆祝活动，在疫情期间这些活动都耽搁了。我想做一个剪彩仪式。托纳尔与他的许多同行一样，渴望在亚洲市场弥补失去的时间。

Nowhere is the proximity more important than when trying to understand the evolving relationship that Chinese buyers have with timepiece trends. Twenty years ago, when Swiss watchmakers first began operating in the region, the prevailing aesthetic adhered to a simple formula: “Everybody was looking for a classic three-handed gold watch with a white dial,”
在试图了解中国买家与钟表潮流之间不断演变的关系时，这种接近是最重要的。20年前，当瑞士制表商刚开始在该地区经营时，流行的审美遵循一个简单的公式：“每个人都在寻找一款经典的白色表盘三指针金表，”

Whether that has anything to do with President Xi Jinping’s “common prosperity” campaign, aimed at discouraging public displays of wealth, the Swiss aren’t saying, but the sporty, casual trend appears to have legs. It is even playing out in the rapidly growing pre-owned market, despite a longstanding preference among Chinese buyers for new, rather than used, goods.
这是否与主席旨在阻止公开炫富的“共同富裕”运动有关，瑞士人并没有说，然而运动、休闲的趋势似乎开始蔓延发展，这种潮流甚至延伸到了在快速增长的二手市场上，尽管中国买家长期以来更喜欢购买新表，而不是二手商品。

But instead of following suit, Parmigiani in January introduced the Tonda PF Xiali Calendar, with a complete Chinese calendar. The horologically complex wristwatch combined solar and lunar calendars on a red dial — a color considered auspicious in China — framed by a platinum case.
但帕玛强尼并没有跟风，而是在今年1月推出了Tonda PF夏历腕表，内置了一套中文万年历。这款手表的钟表设计非常复杂，在红色表盘上结合了阳历和阴历，红色在中国被认为是吉祥的颜色，表壳则是铂金的。

Last month, Louis Vuitton took a similar approach with its Tambour Opera Automata, which honors the art of bian lian, or face changing, a style of Sichuan opera in which performers rapidly change colorful masks to indicate different emotions.
上个月，路易威登也采取了类似的做法，推出了Tambour Opera Automata腕表，这款产品向川剧中的“变脸”致敬，这是一种表演者迅速更换彩色面具以表达不同情绪的艺术手法。

Dashed Hopes. If there were a single indicator of the high hopes, and supreme disappointment, of China’s soccer dream it might be its perpetually underachieving men’s national team. Traditionally, China has enjoyed far more success in women’s soccer. The men’s team’s future looks even less bright. The Premier League did the same in 2020, tearing up a deal that was its most lucrative overseas contract, and has now signed one worth considerably less. 
希望破灭-若要用一个指标来概括中国足球梦的高度期望和极大失望，那大概就是永远低迷的中国男足。传统上，中国在女子足球方面的成就要大得多。男队的未来看起来更加暗淡。英超联赛在2020年也做了同样的事情，它废除了一份曾经是它最赚钱的海外合同，现在则签署了一份价值低得多的合同。

After Chen’s arrest, Hu Xijin lamented the sorry state of the country’s soccer program on Chinese social media. Zibo Cuju, a team based in a city once recognized by FIFA as “the cradle of the earliest forms of football.”
陈戌源被捕后，胡锡进在中国社交媒体上对中国足球项目的糟糕状况表示遗憾。还有淄博蹴鞠队，淄博曾被国际足联认定为“孕育出最早的足球形式”。

Playing up the ‘democracy vs. authoritarianism’ narrative and stoking a new Cold War will only bring division and confrontation to the world, The hard part is knowing what all this means, how it might be applied, and what place the United States, France’s oldest ally, would have in such a world.
渲染‘民主与专制’的说法，煽动一场新的冷战，只会给世界带来分裂和对抗。困难之处在于，要知道这一切意味着什么，如何应用，以及美国——法国最古老的盟友——在这样一个世界中将处于什么位置。

The announcement was a pointed reminder of how China remains a critical market for European companies, even as American manufacturers are pulling up stakes. The deal “underpins the positive recovery momentum and prosperous outlook for the Chinese aviation market,”, Still uncertain is whether Europe will yield to Chinese pressure to assemble wide-body jets in China.
这份公告清楚表明，哪怕美国制造商纷纷撤出，中国仍是欧洲企业的关键市场。这笔交易“为中国航空市场的积极复苏势头和繁荣前景奠定了基础”, 目前仍不确定的是，欧洲是否会在中方压力之下选择在中国组装宽体飞机。

During a whirlwind trip to China in November, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said Beijing and Berlin should work together amid a “complex and volatile” international situation. Frequent quarantines, especially of intercity travelers, had badly crimped air travel within China for three years.
德国总理朔尔茨在去年11月的旋风式访华时表示，在“复杂多变”的国际形势下，中德应携手合作。在长达三年的时间里，频繁的隔离——尤其是对城际旅客的隔离——都严重影响了中国境内的航空旅行。

When members of Congress grilled TikTok’s chief executive last month on Capitol Hill, the app’s supporters sprang to its defense online.The lawmakers were “old, tech-illiterate,” one said. “Out of touch, paranoid and self-righteous,” said another. The hourslong hearing “destroyed the illusion that US leads in cyber era,” read another post.
上月国会议员在国会山对TikTok的首席执行官进行质询时，该应用程序的支持者在网上为其辩护。有人说，这些议员“老朽、技术盲”。还有人说他们“脱离现实、偏执、自以为是”。另一个帖子写道，长达数小时的听证会“摧毁了美国在网络时代领先的幻想”。

What the U.S. should do is to stop smearing and slandering, and provide a fair, just, open, and nondiscriminatory business environment for companies from all over the world,
美方应当停止在数据安全问题上散布虚假信息，停止无理打压有关企业，为各国企业在美投资经营提供开放、公平、公正、非歧视的营商环境。

Japanese depredations were blamed for stifling national development. It didn’t help that Tokyo showed a lack of remorse with its history of using school textbooks that were seen in Korea as glossing over its wartime brutality and with visits by Japanese politicians to the Tokyo shrine where convicted war criminals are honored. Mr. Yoon quickly followed up with a state visit to Japan — the first between the two countries in 12 years — where he tossed back a beer with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
人们指责日本的掠夺扼杀了国家的发展。东京没有表现出悔悟，使用了在韩国看来是掩盖战时暴行的教科书，日本政客参拜供奉着被定罪的战犯的靖国神社，这些让情况变得更糟。尹锡悦随后很快对日本进行了国事访问，这是12年来两国之间的首次国事访问。访问期间，他与日本首相岸田文雄一起喝啤酒。

In a cathartic release of resentment, the South Korean government in 1995 began demolishing Japan’s grand former colonial headquarters — a great architectural loss — that had dominated central Seoul. After the Japanese left, it became a government building and later a museum. I wandered through it as a child, enthralled by the wondrous exhibits of Korean history and art, and I couldn’t quite understand why it had to be leveled. But such vestiges of the colonial era had to be “eradicated,” we were told, as if they were cockroaches. 
1995年，为了宣泄不满情绪，韩国政府开始拆除占据首尔市中心的前日本殖民总部大楼——这是一项建筑上的重大损失。日本人离开后，它变成了政府大楼，后来又变成了博物馆。我小时候曾在这里漫步，被奇妙的韩国历史和艺术展品所吸引，我不太明白为什么它必须被夷为平地。但我们被告知，这些殖民时代的遗迹必须“根除”，就好像它们是蟑螂一样。

China has exerted tremendous influence on Korea for more than 2,000 years and for centuries was viewed by Korean intellectuals as the source of all that was civilized. We avidly embraced Chinese literary, cultural and philosophical traditions and used China’s writing system for much of our history. I was one of the admirers. My mother enrolled me as a child in private lessons on reading classical Chinese, which was considered the height of sophistication. The elegance of the texts moved me deeply.
两千多年来，中国对韩国产生了巨大的影响，几个世纪以来，中国一直被韩国知识分子视为一切文明的源泉。我们热切地接受中国的文学、文化和哲学传统，在我们的大部分历史中使用中国的文字系统。我也曾是中国的仰慕者之一。还是个孩子的时候，母亲就为我安排私教学习古汉语，一种极为艰深的语言。文字的优美深深打动了我。

“I’ve arrived in skies north of Taiwan Island. The plane is operating normally and the missiles are in good shape,” a pilot says. The video ends with a voice saying: “Missile ready. Fire!” Live-fire exercises were scheduled to take place on Monday in the waters off Pingtan, an island in Fujian Province, opposite Taiwan, but details of what took place there were scant.
“我已抵达台岛北部附近空域。飞机工作正常，导弹状态良好，”一名飞行员说。一句话结束了视频：“导弹准备就绪。发射！”实弹演习定于周一在与台湾隔海相望的福建平潭海域举行，但有关演习的细节很少。

What is quite worrisome is that, owing to the sharp increase in naval and air forces from both sides of the strait at close quarters near the median line and around Taiwan, the risks of accidents leading to an inadvertent exchange of fire have greatly increased
比较令人担心的是由于两岸海空兵力在海峡中线与台湾周边海空域短兵相接的频率急剧上升，使发生意外导致擦枪走火的风险也随之大幅增加

President Emmanuel Macron of France complimented China’s top leader on the “very fragrant tea.” It was an exchange of remarkable intimacy, the two leaders, tieless, sharing pleasantries in what was once the official residence of Mr. Xi’s father. What exactly that will mean is not altogether clear.
法国总统马克龙称赞中国最高领导人的“茶很香”；这是一次非常亲密的交流，两人都没有打领带，在习父亲过去的官邸拉着家常。这一伙伴关系究竟意味着什么，目前尚不完全清楚。

In the context of a deepening Cold War with China, this shows that Macron definitely wants to go against the tide, Mr. Macron was playing “the Gaullist card,” a reference to Charles de Gaulle’s bristling assertion of independence from the United States once World War II was won.
在与中国的冷战不断加深的背景下，这表明马克龙肯定想逆势而行，马克龙打的是“戴高乐主义牌”，这是指戴高乐在“二战”胜利后坚决主张独立于美国。

Mr. Macron, while appearing to embrace aspects of China’s worldview, was unequivocal about Russian aggression. The main reason, he suggested, was Russia’s war against Ukraine, “a manifest violation of international law, a country deciding to colonize its neighbor.”
马克龙虽然看似接受了中国世界观的某些方面，但他对俄罗斯侵略行为的态度也毫不含糊。他认为，主要原因是俄罗斯对乌克兰的战争，“这明显违反了国际法，一个国家决定对邻国进行殖民”。

The Chinese economy has been hard hit. If the target of returning to 5 percent growth this year, from the anemic 3 percent of 2022, is to be met, Mr. Xi needs to retain and increase European investment and trade.
中国经济受到了严重打击。如果要实现从2022年3%的贫弱增长恢复到今年增长5%的目标，需要保留并增加欧洲的投资和贸易。

The Europeans are pretty openly sending the signal that they’re not willing to wage economic warfare against China, I think the administration thinks Europeans would have our back in the event of a conflict, but that won’t happen.
欧洲人相当公开地发出了一个信号，他们不愿意对中国发动经济战，我觉得，美国政府认为一旦发生冲突，欧洲人会支持我们，但是这种事不会发生。

A Chinese court on Friday sentenced six people to prison for human trafficking and abuse of a woman found chained to a wall in a shack last year, in a case that has provoked public outrage, dealt a blow to government credibility, and reopened debate about the status of women in China. She had shown signs of mental illness even before being trafficked; after she was discovered last year, she was found to have schizophrenia and hospitalized, according to officials.
周五，中国一法院以拐卖妇女和虐待罪对六人判处有期徒刑，该案中，一名受到虐待的女子去年被人发现拴在一间破屋的墙上。此案激起公愤，打击了政府公信力，再次引发了国内关于妇女地位的辩论。甚至在被拐卖之前，她就已经表现出精神疾病的迹象；据官
