This is a law that potentially could make illegal the kind of mundane activities that a business would have to do to seek due diligence before you agree to a major investment deal, There is a strong need for clarification on which information is sensitive and which is not
这项法律可能会让企业的普通活动成为非法行为，比如在签署一项重大投资协议前寻求尽职调查所必须进行的行为，澄清哪些信息敏感，哪些不敏感，有很大的必要

President Xi of China has vowed to thwart what he views as U.S.-led efforts to “contain, encircle and suppress” China and has said “capitalism will inevitably perish and socialism will inevitably triumph.”
国家主席誓言要挫败他所认为的以美国为首的“围堵、打压”中国的努力，并表示“资本主义最终消亡、社会主义最终胜利”。

“Our goal is not to defeat liberalism, but instead to say that what we have can be as good as what you have.” Jiang Shigong, a legal scholar and apologist for political philosophy, has written that “‘socialism’ is not ossified dogma, but instead an open concept awaiting exploration and definition.”
“我们不是要战胜自由主义，我们只是想说我们这套东西可以跟你一样好。”法学家、政治哲学的辩护者强世功曾写道，“‘社会主义’不是僵化的教条，而是一个开放的、有待探索和界定的概念。”

There is no doubt that China — whatever its trajectory — poses a huge and complex policy challenge for America. But exaggerating fears of an “existential struggle” increases the likelihood of conflict, crowds out efforts to tackle shared challenges like climate change and creates a with-us-or-against-us framing that could alienate the United States from allies and much of the world. Worse, reflexively maneuvering to outcompete or thwart China only validates hard-liners in Beijing who believe America is implacably hostile and that the only response lies in undermining the United States.
毫无疑问，无论中国如何发展，都对美国构成了巨大而复杂的政策挑战。但是，夸大对“生存斗争”的恐惧会增加发生冲突的可能性，使得应对气候变化等共同挑战的努力受到挤占，并形成一种“要么支持我们，要么反对我们”的框架，这有可能疏远美国与盟友跟世界大部分国家的关系。更糟糕的是，条件反射般地采取策略来战胜或挫败中国只会让北京的强硬派更加确信，美国的敌意是执拗的，而唯一的回应只能是削弱美国。

Now, after three years of relying largely on online purchases, many shoppers in China exult in being able to touch fabrics, try on handbags and sunglasses and simply share companionship with others.In the Zhang Yuan neighborhood, where heavily restored buildings have polished wood frames and elegant stone columns, a crowd gathered and waited outside the Dior store to watch for celebrities. 
现在，在度过了以网购为主的三年后，中国的许多购物者为能够触摸面料、试手袋和太阳镜，以及与他人分享购物乐趣而感到非常高兴。在上海张园，保护修缮后的石库门建筑有着打磨一新的木门框和优雅的石柱，人群聚集在迪奥店外等候名人出现。

Analysts say that another factor driving Mr. Marcos’s outreach is his personal desire to rehabilitate his family name, one that for decades was seen as a byword for excess and greed. Despite his new popularity, Mr. Marcos remains a polarizing figure. We fear that more of our sovereignty will be bartered off in exchange for secondhand equipment and promises of military aid
分析人士说，推动马科斯扩大影响力的另一个因素是他的个人愿望，他希望恢复家族名誉，几十年来，他的家族一直被视为过度和贪婪的代名词。尽管获得了新的人气，但马科斯仍然是一个褒贬不一的人物。我们担心我们的更多主权将被用来换取二手设备和军事援助承诺。

 To his detractors, he is a historical revisionist whose sole aim is to whitewash his family’s tarnished legacy; he is accused of waging a disinformation campaign to win the election; For these Filipinos, watching the meeting between Mr. Marcos and Mr. Biden was surreal.
 对他的批评者来说，他企图粉饰历史，其唯一目的是为家族洗刷恶名。他被指发动虚假宣传活动来赢得选举；对这些菲律宾人来说，看到马科斯和拜登的会面会有一种难以置信的感觉。

 Mr. Marcos, 65, got an early taste of politics from his father. As a child, he met two of China’s transformative leaders, Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, and Gen. Francisco Franco, the Spanish dictator. Mr. Biden noted that the last time Mr. Marcos was in the White House was when he accompanied the elder Marcos in a meeting with former President Reagan.In 1986, Mr. Biden, then a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, criticized President Ronald Reagan’s “waffling statements” on the elder Marcos
 65岁的马科斯从小通过父亲接触政治。他在儿时见到过毛泽东和邓小平——中国的两位划时代领导人——以及西班牙独裁者弗朗西斯科·佛朗哥将军。拜登提到马科斯上一次来白宫，是陪同老马科斯会见前总统里根。1986年，时任参议院外交关系委员会成员的拜登批评罗纳德·里根总统就老马科斯发表了“胡说八道”的言论

 On Wednesday, U.S. intelligence agencies were still trying to determine what happened, according to two American officials briefed on the situation. “We simply don’t know,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said at a public event at The Washington Post, adding, “I would take anything coming out of the Kremlin with a very large shaker of salt.”
 据两名了解情况的美国官员表示，周三，美国情报机构仍在试图确定究竟发生了什么。“我们根本不知道，”国务卿布林肯在《华盛顿邮报》的一次公开活动上说，他还表示，“我对来自克里姆林宫的任何东西都持很大的怀疑态度。”

 By trumpeting the attack rather than denying it, Russian officials were acknowledging their lack of air defenses, their vulnerability, weakness and helplessness,That means they found some pluses in this and, evaluating them, decided that the pluses would be able to outweigh the minuses.
 通过大肆宣扬而非否认这次袭击，俄罗斯官员相当于承认了“防空能力不足，（承认了）他们的脆弱、缺陷和无助”，这意味着他们在其中发现了一些好处，并对其进行了评估，认为好处能够超过短处。

The sprawling red fortress of the Kremlin contains several buildings, including the yellow, domed Senate Palace, which was visible in video footage showing what appears to be a drone exploding. Inside that palace are the president’s official residence and his main office.
克里姆林宫这个庞大的红色堡垒由数座建筑组成，包括有黄色圆顶的元老院，它出现在其中一架无人机爆炸的视频片段中。元老院是总统官邸及其主要办公地点。

The U.S. military conducted routine inspections at the camp town clubs, keeping photo files of the women at base clinics to help infected soldiers identify contacts. The detained included not only women found to be infected, but also those identified as contacts or those lacking a valid test card during random inspections.They were held in facilities with barred windows and heavily dosed with penicillin. The women interviewed by The Times all remembered these places with dread, recalling colleagues who collapsed or died from penicillin shock.
美国军方定期检查基地村俱乐部，在基地诊所保存这些女性的照片档案，以帮助受感染的士兵识别接触者。被拘禁者不仅包括被发现感染的妇女，还包括在随机检查中被确定为接触者或没有有效检测卡的女性。她们被关在窗户有栅栏的设施里，并被大量注射青霉素。接受时报采访的女性都恐惧地回忆起这些地方，回忆起那些因青霉素休克而晕倒或死亡的同事。

In a psychiatric report that Ms. Park submitted to the South Korean court in 2021 as evidence, she compared her life with “walking constantly on thin ice” out of fear that others might learn about her past. Her arms and thighs show scars from self-inflicted wounds.Her voice quavered recalling women who killed themselves after G.I.s who had taken them as common-law wives subsequently abandoned them and their children.
在朴女士于2021年提交给韩国法院作为证据的一份精神病学报告中，她把自己的生活比作“总是如履薄冰”，因为担心别人会知道她的过去。她的手臂和大腿上有自残留下的疤痕。她用颤抖的声音回忆起那些自杀的女性——美国士兵先是视她们为事实上的妻子，随后又抛弃她们和孩子。

While these explanations are not mutually exclusive, the Capvision case adds more weight to the national security argument, In that case, the actions may not be arbitrary, but they will have a chilling effect, especially with investors and local staff employed by U.S. firms.
这些解释不是非此即彼的，但凯盛案为国家安全的论点增加了更多分量，在这种情况下，这些行动可能不是武断的，但它们会产生寒蝉效应，尤其是对投资者和美国公司雇用的当地员工。

Before Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan arrived in Seoul to meet President Yoon Suk Yeol and to nurture a fledgling détente, South Koreans had been waiting intently for what Mr. Kishida might say about Japan’s brutal colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula in the early 20th century. But Mr. Yoon said he would not dwell on seeking such an apology. It’s not something we can unilaterally demand; it’s something that should come naturally from the other side’s sincerity
在日本首相岸田文雄抵达首尔会见韩国总统尹锡悦、进一步促进刚起步的缓和关系之前，韩国人一直在密切关切岸田文雄会如何评论日本在20世纪初对朝鲜半岛的残酷殖民统治。但尹锡悦表示，他不会纠缠于寻求这样的道歉。这不是我们可以单方面要求的；这应该随着对方的诚意自然而然地出现

Mr. Kishida, traveling amid a more amicable mood, has said he wants to “add momentum” to the improving relations. South Koreans cannot pardon us. They will continue to pressure us, and they want to maintain these sort of relations forever by moving the goal posts.
岸田文雄在一种更为友好的气氛中出访，他表示希望为两国不断改善的关系“增添动力”。韩国人不能原谅我们。他们将继续向我们施压，他们希望通过不断改变球门柱来永远维持这种关系

As the history of the ties between South Korea and Japan has repeatedly shown, a reconciliatory move over one historical dispute accomplishes little if another dispute, such as over the territorial rights over a set of islets between the two nations, is rekindled. The history issues have a way of coming back and biting you in the rear end
正如韩日关系的历史一再表明的那样，如果在一个历史争端上采取和解行动，而另一个争端——比如两国之间一系列小岛的领土权问题——再度燃起，那么先前的和解行动就不会有什么效果。历史问题总有办法反噬你

A major diplomatic rift erupted between Canada and China on Tuesday as Beijing expelled a Canadian diplomat in a tit-for-tat move just hours after Ottawa said it had ordered a Chinese envoy to leave amid allegations of influence peddling. The claim has no factual basis and is totally groundless.
周二，加拿大和中国爆发了重大外交摩擦，北京采取报复措施驱逐了一名加拿大外交官，数小时前，渥太华命令一名中国外交官离境，该国关于中国发起影响力运动的指控正在发酵。有关说法毫无事实依据，纯属无稽之谈。

She pushed him off her. She stomped on his foot. She hit him with her handbag. She kneed him.
她把他从身上推开。她猛踩他的脚。她用手提包打他。她用膝盖顶他。

Beijing has insisted that the balloon was a civilian airship that had been blown off course, and has accused the United States of overreacting. a “top priority” was to stabilize relations, “avoid a downward spiral, and prevent accidents between China and the United States,” according to China’s official readout of the meeting. Mr. Qin said he hoped the Biden administration could “reflect deeply” and push the relationship “back on track.”
中国政府则坚称气球是被风吹离航线的民用飞艇，并指责美国反应过度。据中国官方的会谈纪要，“当务之急是稳定中美关系、避免螺旋式下滑，防止中美之间出现意外。” 秦刚表示，希望拜登政府能“深刻反思”，推动两国关系“重回正轨”。

The organization was awarded the local news reporting prize for a series that revealed how the police force in a town, Brookside, inflated its revenue by aggressively increasing traffic citations and vehicle seizures. Another prize for local reporting was awarded to Anna Wolfe of Mississippi Today, for an investigation into a $77 million welfare scandal that revealed how former Mississippi governor, Phil Bryant, had steered funds to benefit family and friends, including the former N.F.L. quarterback Brett Favre.
这家媒体因系列报道获得地方新闻报道奖，这些报道揭露了布鲁克赛德镇的警察部队如何通过大幅增加交通罚单和车辆扣押来增加收入。另一个地方报道奖授予《今日密西西比》的安娜·沃尔夫，她对一桩7700万美元福利丑闻的调查揭露了密西西比州前州长菲尔·布莱恩特如何操纵资金，让家人和包括前全国橄榄球联盟四分卫布雷特·法夫尔在内的朋友受益。

The preliminary effort to put guardrails into the system is clear to anyone who has tested ChatGPT’s initial iterations. The bots will not answer questions about how to harm someone with a brew of drugs, for example, or how to blow up a dam or cripple nuclear centrifuges, all operations the United States and other nations have engaged in without the benefit of artificial intelligence tools.
任何测试过最初几个版本的ChatGPT的人都看到了将保护措施置入系统的努力。例如，机器人不会回答有关如何自制药物伤害他人的问题，或者如何炸毁大坝或破坏核离心机，美国和其他国家在没有人工智能工具的情况下都参与过这些行动。

The hospital in southern Beijing advertised itself as specializing in vascular tumors, especially benign birthmarks that often appear in infants. some Chinese news outlets managed to interview relatives of Changfeng Hospital patients, who described an elderly father who had been there since last summer because of disabilities after a cerebral hemorrhage, and another man, 76, who had no motor skills and lived there full time.
这家位于北京南部的医院宣传自己专门治疗血管肿瘤，尤其是经常出现在婴儿身上的良性胎记。一些中国新闻媒体设法采访了长峰医院病人的亲属，他们描述了一位年迈的父亲，因为脑溢血导致失能，他从去年夏天开始就住在那里；还有一位76岁的老人，已失去行动能力，一直住在那里。

Every day when he arrives at his office in City Hall, Mayor Ken Sim stares at a prominent black-and-white photograph of Chinese railway workers toiling on the tracks in British Columbia in 1884. Six months ago, his historic landslide victory was widely lauded, viewed as the triumph of a politically adroit change-maker whose centrist policies had swept him to power.
每天来到他在市政厅的办公室时，沈观健(Ken Sim)都会盯着一张摆在显眼位置的黑白照片看一眼，那是中国工人在不列颠哥伦比亚省的铁路上辛苦劳动的照片，摄于1884年。六个月前，他以压倒多数选票获胜的历史性事件曾受到广泛称赞，人们将其视为一名政治机敏的变革者的胜利，他的中间派政策让他上台。

Vancouver has been convulsed by soaring real estate prices that have made it among the most unaffordable cities in North America. At the same time, a drug overdose crisis is raging in its Downtown Eastside, an area blighted by homelessness, poverty and crime. Vancouver, a multicultural west coast port city of about 660,000, is among the most picturesque, tolerant cities in Canada, where residents can buy CBD dog treats for their anxious canines at local marijuana shops before biking in Stanley Park.
哥华一直受到房地产价格飙升的冲击，这让它成为北美房价最贵的城市之一。与此同时，一场药物过量的危机正在肆虐市中心东区，该区不断受到无家可归、贫困和犯罪问题的困扰。温哥华有约66万人口，是西海岸一个多元文化的港口城市，也是加拿大最美丽、最宽容的城市之一，那里的居民可以在当地的大麻店给他们焦虑的狗买含大麻提取物的零食，然后去斯坦利公园骑自行车。

But the cost of delay can be observed in the Ukrainian territories that Russia still controls: the death pits, the torture chambers and the empty homes of kidnapped children. Tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides have unnecessarily died.
但在俄罗斯仍然控制的乌克兰领土上，却可以看到拖延导致的代价：乱葬岗、酷刑室以及孩子被绑架后留下的空房子。双方都有数以万计的士兵做出了无谓的牺牲。

If Russia detonated a weapon, it would lose that jealously guarded treasure of superpower status. Such an act would constitute an admission that its army has been beaten — a tremendous loss of face. 
如果俄罗斯引爆了一件武器，它就会失去小心翼翼守护的宝藏一般的超级大国地位。这样的行为相当于承认其军队已被击败——颜面尽失。

Six equipment manufacturers pitched their gear to him, he said. Mr. Nettles chose ZTE because the company offered equipment at less than half the cost of other bids. Pine Belt initially bought $5 million in ZTE equipment, including hundreds of antennas, radios and other gear for its 67 cell towers. Early this month, Mr. Nettles drove 15 miles to a rusting 300-foot tower where two workers were preparing to tear out Chinese gear. Rigged with ropes and pulleys, they planned to climb the tower to assess if it could hold the weight of an additional three antennas and radio equipment from Nokia.
他说，当时有六家设备制造商向他推销设备。内特尔斯选择中兴通讯是因为他们的报价不到其他商家的一半。松林带最初购买了价值500万美元的中兴通讯设备，包括用于其67个手机信号塔的数百台天线、无线电和其他设备。本月初，内特尔斯驱车24公里来到一座90米高、锈迹斑斑的基站，两名工人正准备拆掉中国的设备。他们布好绳索和滑轮，准备爬上基站，评估它是否能承受再增加三根诺基亚天线和无线电设备的重量。

The workers decided they had to pour cement under the tower to create a stronger base for the additional load. The tower will have to hold the old ZTE and new Nokia equipment during the rip-and-replace work to prevent any service interruptions.
工人们最终认为，他们需要在基站下浇筑水泥，为额外的负载创造一个更结实的基础。在“拆换”计划进行过程中，基站将不得不同时容纳旧的中兴设备和新的诺基亚设备，以防止服务中断。

One by one the tour buses descended on the blue collar neighborhood in Hong Kong known as To Kwa Wan — literally translated as Potato Bay — unloading throngs of travelers from mainland China outside large restaurants where a quick lunch awaited them inside. Outfitted in white, red and orange ball caps to denote which tour they belonged to.
旅游巴士一辆接一辆地来到香港蓝领社区土瓜湾，在大餐厅外面卸下成群的中国内地游客，他们是来这里吃简餐的。游客们头上戴着白色、红色、橙色的棒球帽，帽子的颜色表明他们属于哪个旅游团。

Before the pandemic, an influx of mainlanders and their wealth into Hong Kong sent prices and rents soaring, fueling frustrations among the city’s residents that sometimes spilled over into outright bigotry. Local residents also say the tourists — who tend to travel in groups of two dozen or more — are too noisy, are snarling traffic and are blighting public spaces by squatting and dining on boxed lunches outdoors. One group offended local sensibilities by slurping cup noodles outside a public toilet in Repulse Bay, a beach redoubt of multimillion-dollar homes.
内地人和他们的财富曾在疫情前涌入香港，导致了当地的房价和租金飙升，加剧了香港居民的不满情绪，这种情绪有时甚至演变成公然的歧视。当地居民还说，这些动辄二三十人的旅行团太吵，妨碍交通，还有人蹲在外面吃盒饭，有碍观瞻。在数百万美元豪宅的藏身之地浅水湾，有旅游团在一个公共厕所外大声吃着杯面，颇让当地人难堪。

City officials in the northern German port of Kiel were flattered this year when the Chinese port of Qingdao — about 40 times its size — proposed partnering up as a sister city. They rushed to embrace the offer. Kiel, home to about 250,000, hosts much of Germany’s Baltic naval fleet, Germany’s equivalent of the Navy SEALs, military research facilities and big shipbuilders making, among other things, six brand-new, state-of-the-art submarines. Kiel, an especially outgoing city, has 13 such partnerships, with places as disparate as San Francisco and the Moshi district in Tanzania.
今年，当德国北部港口基尔的市政府官员听到中国港口青岛提议与它结成姐妹城市时感到受宠若惊，青岛的面积是基尔的40倍。官员们赶紧接受了这个提议。基尔拥有大约25万人口，德国波罗的海海军舰队（相当于海豹突击队）的大部分驻扎在那里，还有许多军事研究设施和大型造船厂，而且包括六艘全新、最为先进的潜艇。基尔是一座特别外向的城市，从旧金山到坦桑尼亚的莫希区，该市拥有13个这样的伙伴关系。

The facility belonged to Yangtze Memory Technologies Corporation, or YMTC, a memory chip company that Xi Jinping, China’s president, has extolled as a flag-bearer in China’s race toward self-reliance. Now, the chip maker and its peers are hurriedly overhauling supply chains and rewriting business plans.
这家工厂是被中国国家主席习近平寄予厚望的国家存储器基地项目实施主体长江存储科技有限责任公司。现在，这家芯片制造厂和其他同类工厂正在忙着改变供应链、重写商业计划。

Western technology and money have pulled out, but state funding is flooding in to cultivate homegrown alternatives to produce less advanced but still lucrative semiconductors. During those earlier trade tensions, Beijing mobilized vast sums to cultivate homegrown alternatives to Western chip makers. But foreign components were readily available and of higher quality, leaving many Chinese firms unwilling to make the switch. 
西方的技术和资金已经撤走，但政府正在为培育本土替代产品投入大量资金，尽管本土生产的半导体不是最先进的，但利润仍然丰厚。在面临这些早期贸易限制后，中国政府曾为培育取代西方芯片制造商的本土公司投入大量资金。但外国零部件仍容易得到且质量更高，让许多中国公司不愿改为使用国产芯片。

The technology disputes between the world’s two largest economies show no signs of abating. The goal now in China in a lot of areas is to de-Americanize supply chains.
世界上两个最大经济体在技术方面的争端没有缓和的迹象。中国很多行业目前的目标是在供应链中去美国化.

It has become commonplace to perceive Vladimir Putin as reverting to Soviet ways. So it seemed natural, shortly after the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was arrested in Russia, that when I ran into a woman I’d known in Moscow back in the Soviet days, I lamented that things were more and more as they had been in those bad old days.
普京要复辟苏联如今已经成了一个普遍看法。于是当我偶遇一位在苏联时代的莫斯科结识的女士时，我自然就对她哀叹，现在看上去越来越像那些糟糕的旧时代了。当时《华尔街日报》记者伊凡·格什科维奇刚刚在俄罗斯被捕不久。

No old Soviet dissident would deny that the physical quality of life in Russia is far higher than it was in those spartan times. Back then, non-Russian ethnic groups may have identified the Soviet yoke with Russia, but Communist ideology was universalist, and the Russians who opposed it saw themselves as allied with other oppressed nationalities, and with the West, in their struggle.
任何一个老苏联异议者都无法否认，就实际感受而言，俄罗斯的生活质量远远高于那个艰苦的年代。那时候，非俄罗斯民族可能将苏联与俄国等同，但共产主义意识形态是普世的，反对它的俄罗斯人相信自己在斗争中是与其他受压迫民族和西方站在一起的。

Even if some read too much into Mr. Macron’s words, they were music to Chinese ears, given Beijing’s goal of trying to divide Europe from the United States. China supports Europe’s self-chosen development path, supports its European strategic autonomy, and it also maintains a steady and stable European policy. their exchanges were polite but pointed;
即使有些人对马克龙的话进行了过度解读，但考虑到北京试图分裂欧洲和美国的目标，这些话对中国人来说也是非常悦耳的。中国支持欧洲人民选择的发展道路，支持欧洲战略自主，始终保持对欧政策稳定连续。他们的交流礼貌但又尖锐

LinkedIn, the networking platform used by millions of employees and companies, said on Monday it will pare down its operations in China, capping a multiyear pullback that exemplified the challenges of running a foreign business in China.
周一，数以百万计的雇员和公司使用的求职平台领英表示，将停止在中国的业务，该平台多年来已在缩减该业务，停业是外国企业在华经营面临挑战的例证。

When a computer virus paralyzed machinery at his employer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Mr. Lee pulled a 48-hour shift to help fix the problem. For years he responded to phone calls day and night. A shrinking population, demanding work culture and an abundance of competing tech jobs have meant workers have become ever more scarce. Now when searching for talent, they are not very picky. Frank Lin, 30, is one such TSMC researcher who left because he found the work tedious and unfulfilling.
当他的雇主——台湾积体电路制造的设备因计算机病毒而瘫痪时，李先生曾连续工作48小时以帮助解决问题。多年来，他不分昼夜地接听电话。人口减少、要求苛刻的工作文化和大量竞争激烈的技术工作意味着人才变得越来越稀缺。现在找人才，也不是很挑剔了，30岁的弗兰克·林就是这样一位台积电的研发者，他因为感到工作乏味、没有成就感而离开。

According to federal prosecutors, he falsely claimed that he was unemployed in order to twist open a spigot of pandemic-era jobless benefits that eventually amounted to $24,000. For the entirety of his public life, Mr. Santos has been a man shrouded in myths. He cast himself as a self-made American success story, spinning audacious lies about university degrees, fast cars and vast wealth. And when that persona unraveled, fellow politicians and the media fixated on the idea that he was a criminal mastermind evading detection. He’s a two-bit thief, He is dead in the water. They got him good.
据联邦检察官透露，为了申领疫情失业救济金，他谎称自己失业，最终陆续领到了2.4万美元。桑托斯的整个公共生活仿佛云山雾罩。他将自己塑造成白手起家的美国成功典范，编造出他坐拥大学学位、跑车和巨额财富的大胆谎言。当他的人设被揭穿，政坛同僚和媒体都确信他就是个未被抓现行的犯罪大师。他就是个无足挂齿的小贼，他已经完蛋了。他们要将他绳之以法。

He’s out, no matter how you do it, because we have a good party in Nassau County, But Mr. Cox, the son-in-law of former President Richard M. Nixon, added a note of frustration, too. “He will make a fortune out of the attention that has been given to him,” he said. Mr. Cox was not the only critic of Mr. Santos left uneasy by the indictment. In shining a light on his misconduct, prosecutors indirectly illuminated the many ways in which political, financial and media institutions failed to weed out people like him. 
不管你怎么做，他都出局了，因为我们党在拿骚县是优秀的党派，但这位前总统尼克松的女婿也表达了无奈。“他会利用自己受到的关注发笔大财，”他说。考克斯并非唯一一个看过起诉书后感到不安的桑托斯批评者。检察官在揭露他的不当行为时，也间接地说明了政治、金融和媒体机构何以在许多情况下没能将他这样的人剔除出去。

The attacks have exposed the widening disconnect between China’s economic ambitions and its security apparatus abroad, which relies on a patchwork of local military, mercenaries and private firms to guard Chinese workers, analysts say. China is on thin ice in the sense that they’re entering some of the most poorly governed places in the world and supercharging conflicts. And every time an attack happens, it angers the Chinese public and forces China to reconsider this light-touch, hands-off approach.
分析人士称，这些袭击事件暴露了中国的经济雄心及其海外安全机构之间越来越大的脱节，中国依赖当地的军队、雇佣军和私营公司来保护海外中国工人。中国正在涉足世界上一些管理最乱的地方，涉足剧烈冲突，从某种意义上说，这存在很大风险. 每次袭击事件发生后，都会激怒中国公众，迫使中国重新考虑这种轻描淡写、不干涉的做法。

Wagner has become more dependent on its mining operations in Africa, a source of hard cash that helps businessmen close to the Kremlin circumvent the Western sanctions imposed after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, said Alessandro Arduino, an expert on Chinese security at King’s College London. Wagner and China have the same exploitative interest in Africa, but Wagner thrives in chaos, while China needs stability
在伦敦国王学院研究中国安全问题的专家亚历山德罗·阿尔杜伊诺称，瓦格纳集团越来越依赖在非洲的采矿业务，这个现金来源帮助那些与克里姆林宫关系密切的商人规避西方在俄罗斯发动对乌克兰的全面战争后对俄罗斯实施的制裁。瓦格纳集团和中国在非洲有着同样的剥削性的利益，但对瓦格纳集团来说越乱越好，而中国需要稳定

President Xi has made it pretty clear that security trumps development, If that requires cracking some skulls at the consulting firms and scaring off foreign capital in the process, then that’s a price that he appears willing to pay, Ultimately, Beijing is betting that access to China’s expansive market is simply too enticing for foreign companies and governments to give up.
习主席已经明示，安全高于发展，哪怕这意味着铁拳制裁咨询公司，并导致外国资本退避三舍，似乎也是他愿意付出的代价，归根结底，中国是在赌外国企业和政府根本舍不得放弃其广阔市场。

China believes it has a relatively high degree of flexibility to use aggressive tactics to protect its interests because the Europeans cannot afford to allow for ruptures, We’ll get to see that theory put to the test going forward.
中国相信它可以相对十分灵活地利用攻击策略来保护自身利益，因为欧洲人承受不起关系破裂的后果，这一假设将在未来受到考验。

Turkey’s nail-biter election will go to a runoff, election officials announced on Monday, extending a pivotal vote that has demonstrated that the incumbent, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is still a formidable political force, despite his failure to secure a first-round victory.
选举官员周一宣布，土耳其难分胜负的大选将进入决选阶段，这场关键表决进入延长赛表明，现任总统埃尔多安虽然未能确保在首轮票选中胜出，他所代表的政治势力依旧强大。

Of particular interest was the fate of Mr. Erdogan, who has often flummoxed and frustrated his Western partners, including the United States, and faced growing discontent amid high inflation and the destruction wrought by earthquakes in February that killed more than 50,000 in southern Turkey.
埃尔多安的结局也值得特别关注，他经常让包括美国在内的西方伙伴感到困惑和沮丧，而高通胀和今年2月在土耳其南部造成5万多人死亡的地震带来的破坏，令他面临越来越多的不满情绪。

In the run-up to the election, Mr. Erdogan freely tapped state resources to improve his chances, raising civil servant salaries and the national minimum wage and unleashing other government spending in an effort to insulate people from the immediate effects of high inflation. He could deploy more such measures between now and the runoff.
选举前夕，埃尔多安肆意动用国家资源为自己拉票，给公务员加薪，提高全国最低工资标准，并加大其他政府支出，以使民众免受高通胀的直接影响。到决选之前，他可能会采取更多此类措施。

President Biden vowed to fix the immigration system, but in many ways things remain as dire as ever. Not only has Mr. Biden failed to deliver meaningful reform, but also his administration has taken a Trumpian approach to the border crisis, issuing what amounts to an asylum ban. He has abdicated his responsibility, leaving room for local governments to act like sheriffs. All the while, Republicans have been steadily marching toward authoritarianism, book ban by book ban and voter suppression tactic by voter suppression tactic.
拜登总统承诺要解决移民系统的问题，但从很多方面看，情况并没有丝毫改善。拜登没能带来切实的改革，不只是这样，他的政府还在边境危机中采取了特朗普式的手段，实际上等于在实施避难收容禁令。他放弃了自己的职责，放任地方政府去以治安官的方式行事。与此同时，共和党人们正在一步步走向专制主义，一本本图书被禁，选民抑制操作层出不穷。

Once ore is taken from the ground, it is usually pulverized and then treated with heat and chemicals to isolate the mineral compounds. The process is wasteful: Cobalt generates about 860 pounds of waste rock for each pound of refined cobalt powder. Refining needs huge amounts of energy. Battery minerals require three to four times as much energy to make as steel or copper. The preferred form of lithium, for example, needs to be heated, steamed and dried. 
矿石从地下开采出来后通常需要粉碎，然后进行热处理和化学处理，以分离出化合物。这个过程产生很多废料：提炼每公斤钴粉会产生大约860公斤的废渣。提炼需要大量能源。提炼电池矿物所需的能量是炼钢或炼铜的三到四倍。例如，获得人们喜欢用的锂形态需要进行加热、蒸发浓缩和干燥处理。

Refining also often causes pollution, and Chinese refineries benefit from less stringent environmental regulations. Grinding graphite causes air pollution. Processing nickel generates toxic waste, which must be disposed of in special structures in the ocean or underground. Experts say that using more sustainable methods to process battery minerals drives up costs.
提炼也往往造成污染，中国的提炼厂受益于不那么严格的环境保护法规。研磨石墨产生空气污染。加工镍产生的有毒废料需要在海洋或地下的特殊结构中进行处理。专家表示，使用更可持续的方法来处理制造电池所需的矿物将导致电池成本上升。

The most important component is the cathode, which is the battery’s positive terminal. Of all battery materials, cathodes are the most difficult and energy intensive to make. Chinese companies make most of the battery’s other components. They dominate the production of anodes, the negative end of a battery. China also sells the most separators, a layer that goes between the cathode and anode to prevent short-circuiting. 
最重要的组成部分是阴极，也就是电池的正端。在所有的电池材料中，阴极的制造最难、也最耗能。电池的大部分其他组件也都由中国公司生产，他们还主导着阳极的生产，也就是电池的负端。中国也销售世界上最多的隔膜，隔膜是位于阴极和阳极之间防止短路的部件。

The United States officially hit its debt limit on Jan. 19, prompting the Treasury Department to use accounting maneuvers known as extraordinary measures to continue paying the government’s obligations and avoid a default. While the debt limit was created to make government run more smoothly, many policymakers believe that it has become more trouble than it’s worth.
美国在1月19日正式达到债务上限，导致财政部采取了被称为非常规措施的审计手段来继续偿还政府债务，避免违约。虽然债务上限的设立目的在于提升政府效率，但许多政策制定者认为，此举带来的麻烦多于好处。

One idea that has been proposed is that the Treasury Department would prioritize certain payments to avoid defaulting on U.S. debt.So far, the Treasury seems to have ruled that out as an option. Treasury systems have all been built to pay all of our bills when they’re due and on time, and not to prioritize one form of spending over another
有人提出一个让财政部优先支付某些款项，以避免美国债务违约。目前，财政部似乎不会考虑采用这种办法，财政制度的存在就是为了在我们的所有账单到期时及时完成支付，而不是优先挑选某种类型的支出

One of the first things he and his colleagues did was ask GPT-4 to write a mathematical proof showing that there were infinite prime numbers and do it in a way that rhymed. The technology’s poetic proof was so impressive — both mathematically and linguistically — that he found it hard to understand what he was chatting with. 
他和同事们做的第一件事是要求GPT-4写一个数学证明，表明存在无限的素数，并且要求押韵。无论是在数学上还是语言上，这项科技得出的美妙证明是如此令人惊叹，以至于他不敢相信自己到底是在跟什么聊天

There are times when systems like GPT-4 seem to mimic human reasoning, but there are also times when they seem terribly dense. “These behaviors are not always consistent,” Ece Kamar, a research lead at Microsoft, said. systems like GPT-4 were no doubt powerful, but it was not clear that the text generated by these systems was the result of something like human reasoning or common sense. When we see a complicated system or machine, we anthropomorphize it;
GPT-4这样的系统有时似乎在模仿人类逻辑，但有时却显得极为迟钝。“它们的行为并不总是前后一致，”微软的一个研究负责人艾捷·卡马尔表示。GPT-4这类系统无疑是强大的，但尚不清楚其生成的文本是否是人类逻辑或常识的结果。每当一个复杂的系统或机器问世，我们都会将之拟人化

But the tide may be changing. The push to get rid of no-kids zones gained momentum last week when the health and welfare safety committee on Jeju Island — a popular tourist destination off the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula — deliberated an ordinance that would abolish no-kids zones island wide.
但风向可能正在改变。取消儿童禁入区的运动上周取得了进展。朝鲜半岛南端的热门旅游胜地济州岛的健康和福利安全委员会审议了一项废除全岛范围内儿童禁入区的法令。

Mr. Hou’s nomination pits him against Lai Ching-te, the governing party candidate and current vice president. the Kuomintang is placing its hopes on a new type of candidate: a popular local leader with a blank slate on the thorny question of China. But the Kuomintang scored big last year, prevailing in almost two-thirds of local mayoral elections contested, races in which geopolitics matter less than bread-and-butter issues.
侯友宜的提名让他与执政党候选人、现任副总统赖清德展开竞争。国民党正在将希望寄托于一种新型候选人身上：一名广受欢迎、在如何处理与大陆关系的棘手问题上没有记录的地方领导。但国民党在去年的地方选举中大胜，赢得了几乎三分之二的市长选举，但地缘政治在地方选举中的重要性低于生计问题。

In an apparent effort to thread the needle, Mr. Hou has said he both opposes Taiwan independence and the “one country, two systems” formulation. The lack of clarity about his stance on China has already been criticized by some observers, At the same time, Mr. Hou’s reticence could make him more appealing to centrist voters
侯友宜表示，他既反对台湾独立，也反对“一国两制”安排，这显然是在找平衡。侯友宜对中国的立场不够明确已经受到一些观察者的批评，与此同时，侯友宜在两岸关系问题上沉默寡言可能让他对中间派选民更有吸引力

Keyu Jin is in the West but not entirely of it. She knows her way around Goldman Sachs and the World Bank. But she is still a proud Chinese. She lived with her parents in Beijing during two recent maternity leaves. she tells a nuanced story that deserves attention at a time of extreme tension between China and the United States.
金刻羽身在西方，但并没有西化。她在高盛和世界银行里游刃有余。但她仍然是一个骄傲的中国人。在最近的两次产假期间，她与父母住在北京。在中美关系极度紧张之际，她讲述了一个值得关注的微妙故事。

In her opening chapter, Jin described her collision-of-cultures experiences as an exchange student in the 1990s at the Horace Mann School, an elite private school in the Bronx. “That a proud Youth League member of the Communist Party could find herself immersed in an American family actively involved in democratic campaigns, conventions and fund-raising seemed utterly surreal,” she wrote.
金刻羽在全书第一章描述了她在1990年代作为交换生在哈瑞斯曼中学经历的文化冲撞，那是布朗克斯的一所精英私立学校。“一个自豪的共青团员会发现自己沉浸在一个积极参与民主运动、大会和筹款活动的美国家庭中，看上去完全是超现实的，”她写道。

China’s leadership “fervently wishes” to avoid vast inequality that breeds distrust and extremism. “China seeks an olive-shaped income distribution for its people, ample in the middle and narrow at the extremes.” China, she wrote, requires that its companies be hefa, heli and heqing — that is, lawful, reasonable and empathetic.
中国领导层“热切希望”避免广泛的不平等，因为那会滋生不信任和极端主义。“中国为其人民寻求橄榄形的收入分配，中间庞大，两头稀少。”她写道，中国要求本国的公司“合法、合理、合情”。

Officials who excel at one level are moved up or transferred laterally to gain experience. For comparison, imagine if Ron DeSantis tried to please President Biden so Biden would promote him to governor of California from governor of Florida.
在一个级别上表现出色的官员会被提拔或横向调动以积累经验。相比之下，这就好比罗恩·德桑蒂斯为了让拜登总统把他从佛罗里达州州长提拔为加利福尼亚州州长而取悦他。

Don’t read too much into grandiose messages,The reality today is that the private sector is fully in the driver’s seat.The reason it’s sluggish is precisely that there’s a lack of confidence in the private sector,The old playbook of calling on Team China to do large infrastructure, that is no longer working.
不要过多解读浮夸的信息，今天的现实是，私营部门完全掌握了主导权。之所以不景气，恰恰是对私营部门缺乏信心，呼吁‘国家队’合力进行大型基础设施建设的老套路已经行不通了。

young Chinese aren’t exactly giving up; they just don’t want to do manual labor or other unappealing work: “They’re interested in innovating to solve society’s problems, not just survival of the fittest.”
中国年轻人并没有完全放弃；他们只是不想做体力劳动或其他没有吸引力的工作：“他们感兴趣的是通过创新来解决社会问题，而不仅仅是适者生存。”

For the Chinese, “the bottom line is to avoid an American-style capitalism,” Jin said, coming back to the metaphor of an olive-shaped income distribution. Essentially, she said, “China wants to be a bigger and smarter Germany. More managed capitalism.”
金刻羽说，回到橄榄形收入分配的比喻，对于中国人来说，“底线是避免美式资本主义。”她说，从本质上讲，“中国希望成为一个更大、更明智的德国。更受控的资本主义。”

Free speech groups were quick to respond to the Montana ban. The American Civil Liberties Union said on Wednesday that the legislation “flouts the First Amendment.”The government cannot impose a total ban on a communications platform like TikTok unless it is necessary to prevent extremely serious, immediate harm to national security
言论自由倡导组织迅速对蒙大拿州的禁令做出回应。美国公民自由联盟周三表示，该立法“是对第一修正案的践踏”。政府不能对TikTok这样的通讯平台进行彻底封杀，除非有必要防止对国家安全遭受极其严重和直接的危害

Rather than being the unchallenged commander of the most powerful superpower striding across the world stage, Mr. Biden will be an embattled leader forced to rush home to avert a catastrophe of America’s own making.
拜登不是在国际舞台上昂首挺胸、一呼百应的最强超级大国的最高指挥官，而是一个焦头烂额的领导人，被迫要赶回国去避免一场美国自己折腾出来的劫难。

Our leadership in the world is being eroded by our internal dysfunction. The markets are still betting against our defaulting, and that’s a decent bet. But if we only manage to eke out a short-term extension and the price is onerous budget caps — including on defense — we will be hobbled when Ukraine needs us most and China is building beachheads everywhere.
我们的全球领导地位正在被国内纷争所侵蚀。市场仍在赌我们不会违约，赌赢的几率还是很高的。但我们若是只能勉强拿出一个短暂延期，并以繁重的预算上限——包括国防——作为代价，那我们就会在乌克兰最需要我们的时候陷入困顿，而中国则会在全球各地占据先机。

The perpetual culture of crisis in Washington, however, has grown only more intense since the arrival of President Donald J. Trump, who threatened to unravel bedrock alliances and embraced longstanding adversaries abroad while disrupting democratic norms and economic conventions at home.
不过，特朗普总统上任后不但威胁要瓦解美国的联盟根基，拥抱长久以来的海外敌对势力，同时还在国内破坏民主规范和经济公约，导致华盛顿根深蒂固的危机文化愈演愈烈。

I don’t think many European governments are very concerned, presumably because these crises come round quite often but never end in disaster, Cutting short the trip is a bad signal, but there is such good will to Biden in most capitals that they are prepared to cut him some slack.
我认为很多欧洲政府并不是十分担心，大概是由于这样的危机时有发生，但从未以灾难收场，缩短行程是个糟糕的信号，但大多国家对拜登都拿出了巨大的善意，是不会在这件事上为难他的。

Beijing fined a Chinese comedy studio around $2 million on Wednesday for a joke that compared China’s military to stray dogs, The authority said his joke had a “vile societal impact.” We will not allow any company or individual to wantonly slander the glorious image of the People’s Liberation Army. The Beijing Municipal Culture and Tourism Bureau confiscated roughly $180,000 worth of what officials described as illicit income uncovered during the investigation,
周三，北京对一家中国喜剧工作室处以1335万人民币的罚款，因为它在一个段子中将中国军队和流浪狗相提并论，当局称他的笑话造成了“恶劣社会影响”。我们绝不允许任何公司和个人在首都舞台肆意诋毁人民军队的光辉形象,北京文旅局还没收了当局在开始的调查中所称的“违法所得”132.5万元人民币

Mr. Li was describing a scene in which his two adopted stray dogs were chasing a squirrel. The ferocity of the dogs’ pursuit, he said, reminded him of a well-known Chinese military slogan about virtue and grit: “Maintain exemplary conduct, fight to win.” The Beijing authority, in announcing the punishment against Xiaoguo, urged artists and writers to have “correct creative thinking” and “provide healthy spiritual nourishment for the people.”
李昊石讲述他收养的两只流浪狗追逐一只松鼠的场景。他说，狗的凶猛追击让他想起了中国军队一句关于品德和毅力的著名口号：“作风优良，能打胜仗。”当局在宣布对笑果的处罚时，敦促艺术家和作家要“端正创作思想”，“为人民群众提供有营养的精神食粮”。

Recently, in addition to traditional Chinese forms of comedy, the Western variety of standup has grown more popular in metropolitan cities such as Shanghai and Beijing. The art form reached mainstream prominence due, in part, to the success of Rock and Roast, a standup competition that drew millions of fans during the pandemic
最近，除了中国传统的喜剧形式外，西方脱口秀在上海和北京等大都市也越来越受欢迎。这种艺术形式之所以成为主流，部分源于《脱口秀大会》的成功，这是一个单口喜剧比赛，在大流行期间吸引了数百万粉丝

China is engaged in a “tough diplomatic tap dance” of trying to gain an edge with Central Asian countries without angering Mr. Putin. China is watching closely as a growing number of Western actors are wooing Central Asia. China aims “to give further reassurance to Central Asia that China will always be here, China is predictable, China is able to provide for the region.”
中国正在进行一场“艰难的外交踢踏舞”，试图在不激怒普京的情况下在中亚国家获得优势。越来越多的西方参与者正在向中亚示好，中国对此正予以密切关注。中国主办此次峰会旨在“进一步让中亚放心，中国将永远在这里，中国是可以预测的，中国有能力为该地区提供服务”。

But the fear permeating the seven large democracies here is that unless the counteroffensive proves highly successful, Ukraine will settle into a bloody, frozen conflict in which the best hope would be an armistice, reminiscent of the one that brought a halt to fighting on the Korean Peninsula 70 years ago this summer.
但这七大民主国家的深切担忧在于，除非反攻取得巨大成功，否则乌克兰将陷入一场血腥而持久的冲突，最好的结局签订停火协议，就和70年前那个夏天朝鲜半岛的停战协议一样。

They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year. We must not let them down. Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, told reporters in Washington last week that Mr. Putin’s threats of escalation now ring more hollow, and that these “are gateways to which are going to have to pass.”
他们需要国际社会的持续支持，以抵御无休止的无情与肆意的攻击，这是他们一年多来每天都要面临的现实。我们决不能让他们失望。英国外交大臣克莱弗利上周在华盛顿对记者表示，普京要升级战争的威胁如今听来更像空谈，这些导弹系统“就是（俄罗斯）必须越过的雄关”。

With the block of Micron, the authorities carved out a space in the industry that Chinese chip makers could fill. The move could also present a new wedge between the United States and its allies, whose companies could make billions of dollars in sales if they were to step in and pick up business that Micron might lose.
通过封杀美光，当局在该行业开辟了一个可以由中国芯片制造商填补的一个空间。此举还可能在美国及其盟友之间制造新的裂痕——如果盟友的公司介入并接手美光可能失去的业务，这些公司可能会获得数十亿美元的销售额。

Regulators would give executives back-room lectures, weigh them down with excessive red tape or hit them with occasional office raids. Rarely did the government tell a firm outright it was no longer welcome. For the better part of a decade, China and the United States have jockeyed over global technological leadership. As each side maneuvered to find new advantages, both came to focus on the semiconductor industry. 
监管机构会在私下训斥高管，用繁文缛节来打压这些公司，或者偶尔对它们的办公地点进行突击搜查。政府很少直接告诉一家公司它不再受欢迎。在过去十年的大部分时间里，中美一直在争夺全球技术领导地位。双方都想方设法寻找新的优势，均开始关注半导体行业。

Beijing views these moves as primarily politically driven and is now willing to go tit for tat,In some ways, China is better equipped for that exchange. In the United States, political debate and legal challenges can dull the sharpness of government efforts. 
北京认为这些举措主要是出于政治动机，现在愿意与其针锋相对，从某些方面看，中国更适合这种交锋。在美国，政治辩论和法律挑战会削弱政府工作的力度。

The flame-shaped neon archway was visible from miles away, which was good since there was little other reason for anyone to be in that part of town, an expanse of fields outside an industrial city in eastern China. The lights flickered between icy blue and red-hot, leaping toward the night sky beside a jumbo sign: “Zibo Barbecue Experiential Ground.”
拱门上火焰形状的霓虹灯在几里地外就能看到，这有用，因为游客几乎没有其他理由来这个地方，这里是中国东部一座工业城市郊外的一片广阔田野。灯光在冰冷的蓝色和炽热的红色之间摇曳，像火焰般跃向夜空，旁边有一个巨大横幅：“淄博烧烤体验地”。

Overall, the Ukrainian air force is “technologically outmatched and badly outnumbered” compared with the Russian air force. Ukraine inherited a sizable but aging fleet of Soviet-designed fighter jets and helicopters, which is a legacy of its history as a part of the former Soviet Union. 
总体而言，与俄罗斯空军相比，乌克兰空军“在技术上和数量上都处于劣势”。乌克兰继承了一支由苏联设计的战斗机和直升机组成的机队，规模可观但已经老化，这是乌克兰作为前苏联一部分的历史遗产。

To the Chinese government, unsurprisingly, “de-risking” isn’t much of an improvement. There is a sense that ‘de-risking’ might be ‘decoupling’ in disguise, Washington’s approach had not strayed from “its unhealthy obsession with maintaining its dominant position in the world.”
不出所料，对中国政府来说，“去风险”并没有多大改善。去风险给人一种可能是变相脱钩的感觉，华盛顿的做法并没有偏离“对维持其世界主导地位的病态迷恋”。

De-risking’s Sordid History. Before it entered diplo-speak, de-risking had a long life in the response to American government sanctions against terrorism and money laundering, where it’s associated with overreaching. In other words, de-risking — in its common usage, pre-April — carries negative connotations of unnecessary exclusion.
“去风险”的黑历史. 在进入外交语汇之前，这个词作为对美国政府的恐怖主义和洗钱制裁的回应早已存在，指的是越界管辖。换句话说，在4月之前，“去风险”一词通常的用途带有“不必要的排斥”这一负面含义。

China’s top leader is now hoping the country’s tech industry can provide a lifeline for growth. And spurred by an escalating tech competition with the United States, China is eager to nurture its beleaguered titans back to life. The worst time policy-wise for them is over. The companies’ fortunes will remain tied to China’s economy. Local governments are saddled with debt. The property sector, long a stimulant of growth, is sputtering. 
中国领导人现在希望该国的科技产业能够成为经济增长的生命线。在与美国不断升级的科技竞争的刺激下，中国急于要让陷入困境的巨头起死回生。对这些公司来说，政策方面最糟糕的时期已经过去, 这些公司的命运仍将与中国经济息息相关。地方政府深陷债务泥潭。房地产行业长期以来一直是经济增长刺激因素，现在萎靡不振。

Those difficulties, both in China and abroad, are keeping some investors away, knowing that the internet companies are not likely to return to the growth rates they had a decade prior. Others think they deserve a second look. I would suggest to forget the past, Now they are coming back, and we’re seeing gradual improvement. We need to give them a new evaluation standard.
中国国内和国外的这些困难让一些投资者望而却步，因为他们知道互联网公司不太可能恢复到十年前的增长率。但也有一些人认为不应该妄下定论。我建议忘记过去，它们正在回归，我们看到它们在逐渐改善。我们需要给它们一个新的评估标准。

Rather than dwell on their disagreements, the leaders of the major industrial democracies lined up their approach to China in a way that Beijing clearly saw as potentially threatening, some analysts noted after the meeting. But what looks like risk reduction to the United States and Europe can look like a nicely worded containment strategy in Beijing.
一些分析人士在会后指出，主要工业民主国家的领导人并没有纠缠于他们的分歧，而是统一了他们对中国的方式，北京显然认为这可能构成威胁。但在美国和欧洲看来是降低风险，在北京看来可能是措辞温和的遏制战略。

Deep in rural Western Australia, Pilbara Minerals’ vast processing plant looms above the red dirt, quivering as tons of a lithium ore slurry move through its pipes. From there, the spodumene is shipped to China, where it is further refined so it can be used in the batteries that power goods like cellphones and electric cars. The challenges of getting such an industry underway are daunting. 
在西澳大利亚州农村地区的深处，皮尔巴拉矿业公司巨大的加工厂赫然耸立在红土地上，厂房随着成吨的锂矿浆从管道里经过而轻微颤动。从那里，这些锂辉石将被运往中国进行进一步提炼，让其成为能为手机和电动汽车等产品供电的电池材料。将这个行业发展起来的挑战艰巨。

China saw Japan at the G7 as “colluding with the U.S.” to “bring Europe into the Taiwan issue,” a move he likened to “waving a red flag in front of a bull.”Chinese state media has lashed out at Tokyo this week, accusing it of doing the “United States’ bidding” and inflating the “China threat” so that it can amend its constitution to build up its military again for the first time since World War II.
中国认为日本在G7会议上“与美国勾结”，以“将欧洲拉进台湾问题”，他将此比作“在斗牛面前挥舞红旗”。中国官方媒体本周猛烈抨击东京，指责它听命于“美国的吩咐”并夸大“中国威胁”，以便其修改宪法、自“二战”以来首次谋求军力的突破。

As House speaker, Ms. Pelosi held a powerful role in policymaking in Washington; by contrast, Ms. Truss was unceremoniously pushed from power. Liz Truss, Britain’s prime minister for 44 tempestuous days
作为众议院议长，佩洛西在华盛顿的决策过程中发挥着重要作用；相比之下，特拉斯被毫不客气地赶下了台。特拉斯去年仅担任了44天首相，过程跌宕起伏。

While China’s economy is expected to strengthen in the coming months, the recovery will remain tenuous until consumers feel confident enough again to make big-ticket purchases — which will prompt more companies to do more hiring.
虽然中国经济预计将在未来几个月走强，但复苏仍将无力，直到消费者再次感到有足够信心大笔花钱——这将促使更多公司增加招聘。

The thunder of artillery echoes night and day over the mighty Dnipro River as it winds its way through southern Ukraine. With Russian and Ukrainian forces squared off on opposite banks, fighters have replaced fishermen, surveillance drones circle overhead and mines line the marshy embankments.
浩瀚的第聂伯河蜿蜒穿过乌克兰南部，河流上空日夜回荡着炮火声。俄罗斯和乌克兰军队隔河而战，渔民被战斗人员取代，侦察无人机在头顶盘旋，地雷遍布泥泞的堤岸。

Carving an arc through Ukraine from its northern border to the Black Sea, through Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, the Dnipro shapes the country’s geography and economy, its culture and its very identity. And now it helps define the contours of battle — as it has for millenniums, a barrier and a conduit to warring Scythians, Greeks, Vikings, Huns, Cossacks, Russians, Germans and many more.
第聂伯河起于乌克兰北部边界，向南穿过基辅、扎波里日亚和赫尔松流入黑海，形成了一条塑造这个国家的地理和经济、文化和身份的弧线。现在，它构成了战斗的轮廓——几千年来皆是如此，它一直是斯基泰人、希腊人、维京人、匈奴人、哥萨克人、俄罗斯人、德国人的屏障和通道。

The dams along the Dnipro were once mighty symbols of Soviet prowess. “Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country,” Vladimir Lenin famously declared in 1920. The conflict has already wrought untold damage.
第聂伯河沿岸的水坝曾经是苏联强大国力的象征。“共产主义就是苏维埃政权加全国电气化”是列宁在1920年的著名宣言。冲突已经造成难以估量的破坏。

This winter, young actors and dancers from the Dnipro Academic Opera and Ballet Theater performed “Sorochinsky Fair,” an operetta based on a story by the Ukrainian writer Nikolai Gogol. It is a love story centered on overcoming evil spirits, mixing Ukrainian folk traditions, crafts and humor.
今年冬天，来自第聂伯歌剧芭蕾舞剧院的年轻演员和舞蹈家表演了《索罗钦的集市》，一部根据乌克兰作家尼古拉·果戈理的故事改编的轻歌剧。这是一个以战胜恶灵为主题的爱情故事，融合了乌克兰民间传说、工艺和幽默。

The New York Times traveled with a group of 54 Afghans through one of the hardest parts of the journey, a notorious jungle crossing known as the Darién Gap, and interviewed nearly 100 people making the trek. Many had entwined their lives with the Western mission in Afghanistan and hoped that, as American allies, they would be received with open arms.
时报与54名阿富汗人一起穿越了旅途中最艰难的一段——臭名昭著的丛林过境点达连隘口——采访了近100名徒步行进的人。许多人的生活曾与西方在阿富汗的使命交织在一起，他们希望能受到热情的欢迎——作为美国的盟友。

The Darién is the only way from South America to the United States by land. It is a roadless, mountainous tangle with notorious hardships: rivers that sweep away bodies, hills that cause heart attacks, mud that nearly swallows children, and bandits who rob and kill.
达连是从南美到美国的唯一陆路通道。这是一个没有道路的崎岖地带，以险恶的环境著称：河水能把人冲走，山丘令人心悸，泥浆几乎吞没孩子，还有抢劫和杀人的强盗。

Struggling to Survive. A village formed in Terminal B of Sao Paulo-Guarulhos airport in Brazil: Afghans sleeping under wool blankets strung like tents across luggage carts. many of the Afghans soon took off, their minds fixed on the United States. They crossed Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, passed liked batons from smuggler to smuggler.
挣扎求生.巴西圣保罗-瓜鲁柳斯机场的B航站楼里，一个村庄形成了：阿富汗人把羊毛毯子系在行李车上，支成帐篷，睡在下面。许多阿富汗人很快就离开了，他们的心思都在美国。他们穿过秘鲁、厄瓜多尔和哥伦比亚，像接力棒一样在蛇头之间被传递着。
