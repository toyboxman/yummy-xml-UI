He canceled his online games and music subscriptions. To make ends meet, he delivered meals last December, working 11 to 12 hours a day. In the end he made a little over $700 a month. He quit because the work was too physically exhausting. In other words, he failed in eating bitterness.
他取消了网络游戏和音乐的订阅。为了维持生计，他从去年12月开始送外卖，每天工作11到12个小时。最后，他一个月下来刚挣了5000元多一点。他辞职了，因为那工作太累了。换句话说，他吃不了苦。

For years, ships wanting to hide their whereabouts have resorted to turning off the transponders all large vessels use to signal their location. But the tankers tracked by The Times go beyond this, using cutting-edge spoofing technology to make it appear they’re in one location when they’re really somewhere else. The vessels are part of a so-called dark fleet, a loose term used to describe a hodgepodge array of ships that obscure their locations or identities to avoid oversight from governments and business partners. 
多年来，想隐蔽行踪的船都会关闭应答器，也就是所有大型船舶都会配备的发送位置信号的装置。但时报追查到的这几艘油轮用的方法不止于此，它们使用了尖端的定位欺骗技术，让自己看起来在一个地方，其实却是在别的地方。这些油轮是所谓“黑暗舰队”的一部分，这个词没有严格定义，指的是各式船舶模糊自己的位置或识别标识，躲避政府和商业伙伴的监督。

For all the sophistication of the spoofing technology, there can be telltale signs for when it is being used, among them, odd geometric patterns in a ship's AIS data — like the course seemingly carved by the Cathay Phoenix off Japan. Experts believe this may at times be the software’s attempt to mimic a vessel at anchor. Now they have a reason to know this conduct occurs, and if they don’t act on it they run the risk of being out of compliance
尽管定位欺骗技术非常复杂巧妙，但船舶使用它时会有迹可循，其中包括船舶的AIS数据中出现奇怪的几何图形，“契丹凤凰”号在日本以外海域的航线就是这样。专家们认为，这有时可能是定位欺骗软件企图模仿一艘抛锚停泊的船舶。现在他们有理由知道这种行为发生了，如果他们不采取行动，会冒下不合规的风险

The agency warns that ship owners may try to avoid scrutiny by using “complex business structures, including those involving shell companies.” a good time for insurers to look for warning signs was during the creation or renewal of a tanker’s policy. This is your opportunity to see if this is a bad apple ahead of time or not. Satellite imagery also showed it docked at a berth for loading petrochemical products.
该机构警告，船东可能试图通过使用“复杂的商业结构”来躲避审查，包括“涉及空壳公司的做法”。保险公司寻找警示信号的好时机是为油轮出保单或续保期间。这是提前看看这是否是一个坏苹果的机会。卫星图像也显示，它停靠在一个装载石化产品的泊位上。

A group of industry leaders warned on Tuesday that the artificial intelligence technology they were building might one day pose an existential threat to humanity and should be considered a societal risk on a par with pandemics and nuclear wars. Mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I. should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks, such as pandemics and nuclear war
一群行业领袖周二警告，他们正在开发的人工智能技术有朝一日可能对人类的生存构成威胁，应被视为与大流行病及核战争同等的社会风险。减轻人工智能带来的灭绝风险应该成为全球的优先事项，就像应对其他社会规模的风险——如大流行病和核战争一样

These fears are shared by numerous industry leaders, putting them in the unusual position of arguing that a technology they are building — and, in many cases, are furiously racing to build faster than their competitors — poses grave risks and should be regulated more tightly.
这些担忧得到了许多行业领导者的认同，这使他们处于一个不同寻常的境地，他们声称，他们正在开发的一项技术——在许多情况下，他们正在拼命工作，以图比竞争对手更快——构成了严重的风险，应该受到更严格的监管。

In the discreet world of high-end art, buyers often remain anonymous. The producer, Wang Zhongjun, was on a roll. The sale, according to Chinese media, became a national “sensation.” Meanwhile, Mr. Wang is struggling, liquidating properties as his film studio loses money each year.
在谨慎的高端艺术品世界中，买家通常保持匿名。制片人王中军当时鸿运当头。据中国媒体报道，那笔交易“轰动”了全国。与此同时，王中军也在惨淡经营，由于年年亏损，他的制片公司正在清算资产。

For a century after van Gogh gathered flowers and placed them in an earthen vase to paint, the artwork’s provenance could be easily traced, and the piece was often exhibited in museums for visitors to admire. Now the painting has vanished from public view, its whereabouts unknown.
在梵高采来鲜花、将它们放在陶瓶中作画后的一个世纪里，这幅画的出处曾很容易追溯，也曾经常在博物馆展出、供人观赏。现在这幅画已从公众视野中消失，下落不明。

In May 1890, van Gogh arrived in Auvers-sur-Oise, a rustic village outside Paris. Deeply depressed, he had cut off much of his left ear a year and a half earlier. His stay at an asylum had not helped. The physician encouraged van Gogh to ignore his melancholy and focus on his paintings. He completed nearly 80 of them in two months, including “Portrait of Dr. Gachet,” considered a masterpiece. He produced “Vase With Daisies and Poppies” at the physician’s home and may have given it to him in exchange for treatment, biographers say.
1890年5月，梵高来到瓦兹河畔欧韦，这是位于巴黎郊外一个淳朴的村庄。由于极度抑郁，他曾在一年半前割掉了自己的大部分左耳。在精神病院住了一段时间对他也没有多大帮助。嘉舍医生鼓励梵高不理会自己的忧郁，集中精力作画。梵高在两个月内完成了近80幅油画，其中包括《嘉舍医生的肖像》，这件作品被视为杰作。梵高的传记作者们说，《雏菊与罂粟花》是在嘉舍医生家里画的，也许是作为治疗费交换给医生的。

A spokeswoman for Sotheby’s said it vetted all buyers and, when necessary, enlisted its compliance department for “enhanced due diligence.” Sotheby’s applies worldwide a 2020 European Union rule that requires auction houses to verify the legitimacy of funds.
苏富比的一名发言人说，所有买家都经过了审查，而且在有必要的时候，还会让公司的合规部门对买家进行“增强尽职调查”。苏富比在全球范围内遵循一项2020年的欧盟规定，该规定要求拍卖行核实买家资金的合法性。

For a while, Mr. Wang, the producer, maintained a high-flying lifestyle, opening a private museum in Beijing in 2017 that showcased the van Gogh and Picasso paintings for a few months. But the market value of his film studio, Huayi Brothers, vaporized as it backed flops. 
有一段时间，制片人王中军保持着高调的生活方式，2017年在北京开了一家私人美术馆，把梵高和毕加索的画作展示了几个月。但他的电影公司华谊兄弟因为制作的片子票房惨败市值蒸发。

Every morning, as millions of Americans light up the gas stoves in their kitchens to heat some water or griddle their hash browns, they aren’t just sending delicious breakfast smells wafting through their homes. The blue flames also emit harmful pollutants like nitrogen dioxides, as well as planet-warming gases.
每天早晨，当成百上千万美国人在厨房点燃燃气灶烧开水或者做土豆煎饼时，飘过家中的不仅是早餐的香味。蓝色的火焰还会释放出有害的污染物，比如二氧化氮，以及导致地球变暖的气体。

The three-bedroom apartment they were visiting — home to Tina Johnson, a mother to three adult children — overlooks elevated train tracks and has an eat-in kitchen filled with the aromas of herbs and spices that she uses to make her favorite dish, an American-style ratatouille. Mrs. Johnson had just cooked a breakfast of fried eggs and potatoes.
他们访问的这套三居室公寓是蒂娜·约翰逊的家，她有三个已经成年的孩子。这套公寓俯瞰高架铁轨，厨房里都是香草和香料的香味，她用它们来做她最喜欢的一道菜——美式焖蔬菜。约翰逊刚刚做了一份包括煎鸡蛋和土豆的早餐。

The machinery quickly detected the change: a rise in concentrations of nitrogen dioxide — which, among other negative health effects, can irritate the respiratory system, aggravate symptoms of respiratory diseases and contribute to asthma. Concentrations climbed to 500 parts per billion, five times the safety benchmark for one-hour exposures set by the Environmental Protection Agency. (Concentrations of benzene, a human carcinogen that is present in cigarette smoke and car emissions, also tripled.)
机器很快检测到变化：二氧化氮浓度上升——这种物质会对健康产生各种负面影响，包括刺激呼吸系统，加重呼吸系统疾病的症状，并导致哮喘。浓度攀升至10亿分之500，是环保局设定的一小时暴露安全基准的五倍。（苯的浓度也增加了两倍，这是一种存在于香烟烟雾和汽车尾气中的致癌物。）

From that conflicted beginning, they embarked on a clandestine, decadelong relationship that included furtive meetings, volleys of amorous notes and several trips overseas. she said was against her will. He said it was consensual.
这个双方有不同看法的事件是一段长达十年的地下关系的开始，其中包括偷偷摸摸的会面、一连串的情书和几次海外旅行。她说那违背了她的意愿。而他说是双方同意的行为。

Sano knew her sexual harassment suit against Hayashi was a long shot. But she went through with it. Although the case received muted attention in the Japanese news media, it roiled the Japanese art world and academic community. She accused Sano of “pushing all the responsibility of their relationship onto my husband, as if she is wholeheartedly the victim.” We are struggling to change the climate, but we are not so successful yet.
佐野名子知道她对林道郎的性骚扰诉讼不太可能成功。但她还是义无反顾，尽管日本新闻媒体对该案的关注冷淡，但它在日本艺术界和学术界引起了轰动. 她指责佐野名子“把他们关系的所有责任都推到我丈夫身上，好像她是纯粹的受害者一样”。我们正在努力改变现状，但迄今还不算很成功。

While the United States has flooded Ukraine with military equipment since the war began in February 2022, American officials have made clear that they do not want it used to hit Russian territory, lest the conflict escalate. On Tuesday, they appeared to hedge that position a bit. The Russian Defense Ministry said that five of the drones had been shot down, and that three had their signals jammed electronically.
自2022年2月战争开始以来，美国向乌克兰大量运送军事装备，但美国官员明确表示，他们不希望这些装备被用来袭击俄罗斯领土，以免冲突升级。周二，他们似乎对这一立场有些闪烁其词。俄罗斯国防部称击落了五架无人机，并干扰了三架的信号。

South Koreans harbor deep skepticism over their government’s ability to handle major disasters. But there has been little training for the general public on how to live with it. The commotion we had this morning encapsulates how the government is failing to understand and respond to this new normal with North Korea. It’s better that they did it and get chewed out than not doing anything and getting chewed out
韩国人对政府处理重大灾难的能力深表怀疑。但在让公众接受这种危机感方面，没有进行什么训练。今天上午的混乱充分体现政府未能理解和应对朝鲜的这种新常态。这样做了然后遭到批评，总比什么都没做而遭到批评要好。

Behind the sticker price for a loaf of bread includes the costs for not only key ingredients but also processing, packaging, transport, wages, storage and company markups. Aside from commodity prices, Europe has experienced particularly harsh increases in costs along the food supply chain.
一条面包的标价不仅包括关键原料的成本，还包括加工、包装、运输、工资、储存和公司加价的成本。除了大宗商品价格，欧洲还经历了食品供应链成本的大幅上涨。

On my first trip to China in more than three years, I awoke to an uncharacteristically brilliant blue Beijing sky. The forsythia and cherry trees were in full bloom, and the city was sparkling. As the days passed, the Beijing sky reverted to its more customary slate gray, and so, too, the initial brightness of my mood about the China of 2023 began to dim a bit. 
这是我三年多来第一次来中国，一觉醒来，看到北京一反常态的蔚蓝天空。连翘和樱花开得正盛，整座城市熠熠生辉。过了几天，北京的天空又恢复了惯常灰蒙蒙的样子，而我最初对2023年的中国持有的乐观情绪也开始黯淡了一些。

The president’s White House doctor has acknowledged that Mr. Biden’s gait has stiffened significantly with age, leading to a much slower, less steady walk. He has stumbled in the past. Republicans have seized on the president’s stumbles as evidence that he is unfit for office, with some using highly unflattering images or videos to make their point online.
白宫医生承认，随着年龄的增长，拜登的步态明显僵硬，走路更慢、更不稳。他过去也曾踉跄跌倒.共和党人抓住周四的事件作为拜登不适合担任公职的证据，一些人使用恶搞的图片或视频在网上表达他们的观点。

But recurring tensions between China and the United States mean that Boeing’s relationship with China will progress in “fits and starts,” he said, adding that there would be plenty of business for Boeing either way.
但他说，中美之间反复出现的紧张关系意味着波音与中国的关系进展将会“起起落落”，他还表示，无论如何，波音都会有大量业务。

“In the absence of dialogue, there are unacceptable risks to both sides,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. That includes, she said, the risk of “sleepwalking into a conflict over Taiwan.”
“不进行对话给双方都带来不可接受的风险，”美国的德国马歇尔基金会亚洲项目主任葛来仪说，包括“在台湾问题上稀里糊涂陷入冲突”的风险。

On Tuesday, China’s foreign minister, Qin Gang, used a meeting with Mr. Musk to convey Beijing’s talking points that a “healthy, stable and constructive” relationship between the U.S. and China benefited both countries, and the world. Mr. Qin said the two countries needed to know when to “step on the brakes” to “avoid dangerous driving,” and when to “step on the gas pedal” to promote cooperation.
周二，中国外交部长秦刚与马斯克见面时传达了中国政府的观点，那就是“健康、稳定、建设性”的中美关系对两国和世界有利。秦刚说，两国在发展好关系上需要知道何时“踩刹车”，避免“危险驾驶”，何时“踩油门”。

The black clouds appeared quickly, sneaking up on sun-seeking revelers on the lake in northern Italy, interrupting early-evening aperitivi and lakefront strolls. Some outlets speculated whether the Alpine boat trip had been an opportunity to swap information. Was it a coincidence that the skipper was fluent in Bulgarian, as some noted, and married to a Russian, Anna Bozhkova? Adding to the intrigue, the surviving passengers appeared to have been spirited away from the lake within hours of the accident. 
乌云突然出现，悄悄地笼罩在意大利北部湖边享受阳光的狂欢者身上，打断了傍晚的开胃酒和湖边散步。一些媒体猜测，这次阿尔卑斯山之旅可能是一个交换信息的机会。有人指出，船长会说一口流利的保加利亚语，而且娶了俄罗斯人安娜·博日科娃，这是巧合吗？更加令人好奇的是，幸存的乘客似乎在事故发生后几小时内被悄悄带离湖边。

Certain countries willfully interfered in other countries’ internal matters and regional affairs, frequently resort to unilateral sanctions and armed coercion, They “create chaos in a region and then walk away, leaving a mess behind,” We never want to let this be replicated in the Asia-Pacific. When friends visit, bring out the fine wine. When jackals and wolves visit, bring out the shotgun.
有的国家肆意插手他国内政和地区事务，动辄单边制裁、武力胁迫，他们“搞乱一个地区以后一走了之，留下一个烂摊子”，我们决不能让这样的事在亚太被复制。朋友来了有美酒，豺狼来了有猎枪。

More than 1,100 people were injured in what officials in a preliminary government report described as a “three-way accident” involving two passenger trains and an idled freight train. The disaster cast a pall over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to modernize India’s infrastructure, which he has made central to his campaign for a third term.
此外共有超过1100人受伤，官方在一份初步的政府报告中称，这是一起“三方事故”，涉及两辆客运列车和一辆闲置的货运列车。这场灾难给印度总理莫迪实现该国基础设施现代化的努力蒙上了阴影，他将基础设施现代化作为自己第三个任期竞选的核心。

The wager was supposed to be a no-brainer. But that bet has soured. All the signals from China are pointing to a bumpy, faltering economic rebound. While countries in the West contend with inflation, China is flirting with the opposite and potentially more malign force of deflation, or persistently low prices that drag on the economy by dampening company profits and wages. Domestic demand is still weak
原本下这样的赌注根本不用考虑。但这个赌注已经失败。来自中国的所有信号都表明经济的反弹磕磕绊绊、举步维艰。在西方国家与通货膨胀作斗争的同时，中国正在应对与之相反、可能更具伤害性的通货紧缩，即因抑制公司利润和工资导致持续低价而拖累经济。国内需求仍然疲软

In a country where major industry and political fortunes alike are often tied to a vast, interwoven rail system, India has lavished public resources on new trains, but its purse strings have been much tighter when it comes to ensuring the safety of those already racing along its tracks.
在印度，主要工业和政治命运往往与庞大的、相互交织的铁路系统联系在一起，印度将大量公共资源投入新火车，但是对于已在轨道上运行的列车来说，安全保障资金要紧张得多。

Three months ago, intent on promoting homegrown safety technology, India’s railway minister, Ashwini Vaishnaw, made a show of placing himself and the chairman of the Railway Board on two trains on a collision course. The idea was to demonstrate the new system, called Kavach, or armor. The two trains sped toward each other on a single track. At a distance of 400 meters — about 440 yards — the new system applied the brakes automatically. But the Kavach system has been installed on only a tiny fraction of India’s trains, This accident is not about the collision-avoidance system
三个月前，为推广本土的安全技术，印度铁道部长阿什维尼·瓦伊什瑙播放了这样一段视频——他自己和铁路局主席坐在两列即将相撞的火车上。这是为了展示名为“卡瓦奇”，意为“铠甲”的新系统。两列火车在一条轨道上快速相向而行。相距400米时，新系统自动实施刹车。但卡瓦奇系统只安装在印度的一小部分火车上,这起事故与防撞系统无关

She was arrested in 2020 and found guilty the next year of making false statements to obtain car registry records. A court ordered her to pay a fine of 6,000 Hong Kong dollars, about $775. She later appealed the conviction.On Monday, five judges from the Court of Final Appeal voted unanimously to overturn the conviction. She was a recipient of the Nieman fellowship at Harvard University in 2022.
她于2020年被捕，并于次年因查车牌登记记录时作出虚假陈述而被判有罪。法院命令她支付6000港元的罚款，约合775美元。她后来对定罪提出上诉。周一，终审法院五名法官一致投票推翻原判。她是2022年哈佛大学尼曼奖学金的获得者。

A swim meet in the southern city of Magnitogorsk featured adolescents diving into the pool wearing camouflage uniforms, while other competitors slung model Kalashnikov rifles across their backs. “Snipers” was the theme adopted for math classes at an elementary school in central Russia, with paper stars enumerating would-be bullet holes on a target drawn on the chalkboard. The drumbeat of indoctrination essentially started with Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea
在南部城市马格尼托哥尔斯克举行的游泳比赛中，青少年身着迷彩服潜入泳池，而其他参赛者则背着卡拉什尼科夫冲锋枪。在俄罗斯中部一所小学，数学课的主题是“狙击手”，黑板上绘制了靶子，用纸星星代表弹孔的数量。教育灌输的号角基本上始于俄罗斯2014年吞并克里米亚

In that, they may be hoping to avoid the disconnect that emerged in the Soviet era, when the education system portrayed the country as the land of Communist plenty, even as ordinary Russians could see that the shelves were bare.Other teachers do not even mention the war, particularly in places like Moscow, where many parents disapprove of attempts to indoctrinate their children.
在这方面，他们可能希望避免苏联时代出现的脱节，当时教育系统将这个国家描绘成共产主义的富足之地，但即便普通俄罗斯人也可以看到货架上空空如也。而有的老师甚至不提战争，尤其是在莫斯科这样的地方，那里的许多父母不赞成对孩子灌输思想的做法。

The Federal Bureau of Prisons said in a statement that Mr. Hanssen was found unresponsive just before 7 a.m. at the United States Penitentiary Florence, where he was serving a life sentence. He was pronounced dead after lifesaving efforts by emergency medical workers. The statement did not identify a cause. Robert P. Hanssen, a former F.B.I. agent who spied for Moscow off and on for more than two decades during and after the Cold War in one of the most damaging espionage cases in American history
联邦监狱管理局在一份声明中表示，在汉森服终身监禁的弗洛伦斯联邦重罪监狱，工作人员在临近早上7时发现他失去了知觉。汉森经抢救无效死亡。声明没有给出死亡原因。汉森曾在冷战期间和冷战后的20多年里断断续续地为莫斯科充当间谍，这是美国历史上最严重的间谍案之一。

The magnitude of Hanssen’s crimes cannot be overstated, They will long be remembered as being among the most egregious betrayals of trust in U.S. history. It was both a low point and an investigative success for the FBI. He told investigators after his arrest that security at the bureau was so lax that it amounted to “criminal negligence,” Using fingerprints, the F.B.I. confirmed that the mole was Mr. Hanssen and surveilled him for months, even promoting him to keep better track of him.
汉森罪行的严重程度怎么强调都不为过，人们不会轻易忘记，他的所作所为是美国历史上最让人震惊的背信弃义之一。对联邦调查局来说，此案是它的一个低谷，也是一次成功的调查。他在被捕后告诉调查人员，调查局的安保工作之松懈可以说得上是“玩忽职守”。联邦调查局利用指纹确认了内鬼就是汉森，并对他进行了数月的监视，为了更好地跟踪他，甚至还给他升职。

He enrolled in dentistry school at Northwestern University, but later transferred to the business school, where he received a master’s degree in business administration. While in dentistry school, he met and married Bonnie Wauck and converted from Lutheran to join her Roman Catholic faith. Bright but brittle, Mr. Hanssen was said to have burned with resentment that did he not receive the respect and assignments he felt he deserved. 
他进入西北大学牙科学院，后来转到商学院，获得工商管理硕士学位。在牙科学院期间，他与邦妮·沃克相识、结婚，并脱离路德教会，皈依了她的罗马天主教信仰。汉森聪明但玻璃心，据说因没有得到他认为自己应得的尊重和任务而充满怨恨。

Hanssen led a double life in more ways than one. An active member of the Roman Catholic lay organization Opus Dei, he presented himself as a religious and committed anti-communist conservative. Hanssen was a thicket of paradoxes, a suburban dad and outwardly devoted family man who professed to be deeply religious while at the same time betraying family, faith and country, all and everyone who ever mattered to him,he fooled them all.
汉森在许多方面过着双重生活。作为罗马天主教世俗组织主业会的活跃成员，他以一个虔诚的反共保守派的形象示人。汉森是矛盾的集合体，一个中产家庭的父亲和一个表面上忠诚的爱家男人，他自称是虔诚的教徒，但同时又背叛了家庭、信仰和国家，以及所有对他重要的人，他愚弄了他们所有人。

The United States has been weighing restrictions on investments into China, which has generated strong pushback from some major investors, and hesitations from some Biden-administration officials who are concerned that overly broad measures could lead to unintended consequences. the administration was “working to craft a narrow and focused program” to restrict investment into certain sensitive technologies with national security implications, such as advanced semiconductors, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
美国一直在考虑限制对中国的投资，这引起了一些主要投资者的强烈反对，也引起了一些拜登政府官员的犹豫，他们担心过于广泛的措施可能会导致意想不到的后果。政府正在“努力制定一个范围狭窄且集中的计划”，以限制对某些涉及国家安全的敏感技术的投资，比如先进半导体、人工智能和量子计算。

A bet on injecting iPhone-esque magic into virtual reality. Apple unveiled its long-awaited entry into virtual reality, or what the tech giant calls “spatial computing,” in the form of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,500 device that looks like exquisitely designed futuristic ski goggles.Others may profit from riding Apple’s coattails.
将iPhone般的魔法注入虚拟现实的一次押注.苹果公司推出了人们期待已久的虚拟现实设备Apple Vision Pro，即该科技巨头所谓的“空间计算”，它售价3500美元，看起来就像设计精美的未来风格滑雪护目镜。其他人可能会因为搭上苹果的顺风车而获利。

Unlike other virtual reality headsets, an external display shows your eyes to others, and the device is controlled using hand gestures, eye movements and your voice. A dial allows you to adjust how immersed you want to be in the virtual world, which is beamed to your eyeballs via two tiny 4K screens.
与其他虚拟现实头戴设备不同，外部显示器可以向他人显示你的眼睛，并且该设备是通过手势、眼动和你的声音来控制的。你可以通过一个转盘调节你想要在虚拟世界中的沉浸程度，虚拟世界通过两个微型4K屏幕传送到你的眼球。

Rays of sunshine in the global economy we saw earlier in the year have been fading, and gray days likely lie ahead, the world economy was experiencing a “sharp, synchronized global slowdown”.Optimism about an economic rebound this year has been dampened by recent stress in the banking sectors. Concerns about the health of the banking industry have prompted many lenders to pull back on providing credit to businesses and individuals, a phenomenon that the World Bank said was likely to further weigh down growth.
我们在今年早些时候看到的全球经济的缕缕阳光正在消退，前方的日子可能会很灰暗。世界经济正在经历“急剧而同步的全球放缓”，银行业最近的压力已经冲淡了今年经济反弹的乐观情绪。对银行业健康状况的担忧促使许多贷方停止向企业和个人提供信贷，世界银行表示，这种现象可能会进一步拖累经济增长。

In addition to the risks posed by rising interest rates, the pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine have combined to reverse decades of progress in global poverty reduction.Emerging market and developing economies today are struggling just to cope — deprived of the wherewithal to create jobs and deliver essential services to their most vulnerable citizens
除了利率上升带来的风险外，大流行病以及乌克兰冲突的共同作用使全球减贫领域数十年来取得的进展倒退。如今的新兴市场和发展中经济体只是在苦苦支撑，它们被剥夺了创造就业机会和向最弱势公民提供基本服务的资金。

digital data blends with the physical world to unlock new capabilities. Imagine wearing a headset to assemble furniture while the instructions are digitally projected onto the parts, for instance, or cooking a meal while a recipe is displayed in the corner of your eye.
数字数据与现实世界融合在一起，释放出新的功能。想象一下，戴着头戴设备组装家具，说明书被数字投影到零件上，或者做饭时，食谱显示在眼角。

The Vision Pro, which resembles a pair of ski goggles, has a white USB cable that plugs into a silver battery pack that I slipped into the pocket of my jeans. To put it on my face, I turned a knob on the side of the headset to adjust the snugness and secured a Velcro strap above my head.
Vision Pro看起来像一副滑雪护目镜，它有一根白色的USB线，可以接入揣在我牛仔裤兜里一块银色电池。为了把它戴在脸上，我转动了设备侧面的一个旋钮来调节舒适度，并把一条尼龙搭扣带固定在头上。

I could turn a dial near the front of the Vision Pro counterclockwise to make the photo backgrounds more transparent and see the real world, including the Apple employees around me, or turn it clockwise to make the photo more opaque to immerse myself.
我可以逆时针转动Vision Pro正面附近的转盘，让照片背景更透明，看到真实的世界，包括我周围的苹果员工；如果顺时针转动它，降低照片透明度，就可以沉浸其中。

The Apple employee’s facial expressions looked lifelike, and her mouth movements synchronized with her speech. But because of how her avatar was digitally rendered, with the uniform texture of her face and the lack of shadows, I could tell it was fake. It resembled a video hologram I had seen in sci-fi movies like “Minority Report.”
这位苹果员工的面部表情看起来栩栩如生，她的嘴部运动与她的讲话同步。但由于她的头像是通过数字技术渲染的，她的脸部纹理均匀，没有阴影，我可以判断出这是假的。它就像我在《少数派报告》(Minority Report)等科幻电影中看到的全息影像。

That may sound like reverence, but the New York City teachers’ union contract expired last September, and Mr. Adams has resisted pay increases that keep up with inflation. Teachers need better compensation, not platitudes celebrating teacher appreciation week. In the face of grand missions of literacy and freedom, advocating for your full lunch break feels petty. Workers are seeing that unless they work together to fight back, institutions will grind them to dust.
这听起来像是尊崇，但纽约市教师工会的合同已于去年9月到期，而亚当斯一直反对给教师加薪，让薪水与通货膨胀同步增长。教师们需要更好的报酬，而不是庆祝教师感谢周的陈词滥调。在文化和自由的宏大使命面前，倡导充足的午餐时间给人斤斤计较的感觉,劳动者看到，除非他们联合起来做斗争，否则将被机构榨干耗尽。

I learned something important then: Victims lie along with perpetrators. After any terrible injustice, we’re tempted to distrust the oppressors while cutting the oppressed some slack. In fact, it’s prudent to be skeptical of all sides, for when people survive atrocities it’s natural to respond with a fury that dials up outrage or leads them to claim firsthand knowledge of what they have only heard. Westerners were too credulous
那时我学到了一些重要的东西：受害者会与加害者一起撒谎。在经历任何极其不公之事后，我们往往不会信任压迫者，同时给被压迫者更多宽容理解。但其实，对各方都持怀疑态度才是谨慎之举，因为当人在暴行中幸存，自然会以愤怒为回应，这种愤怒要么引发更多的怒火，要么会导致他们将道听途说当作亲眼所见。西方人太容易轻信

“Who controls the past controls the future,” George Orwell wrote in “1984.” Yet Orwell may have been too pessimistic,I have seen suppressed history eventually re-emerge — popping up, as a Chinese saying goes, like “bamboo shoots after a spring rain.” In the meantime, all we can do is try to honor truth — often a messy, nuanced truth that still hides mysteries — and thus play our part in what the Czech-born writer Milan Kundera described as “the struggle of memory against forgetting.”
“谁控制了过去，谁就控制了未来，”乔治·奥威尔在《一九八四》中写道。不过，奥威尔可能过于悲观了，我看到被掩埋的历史最终还是重见天日，与此同时，我们所能做的就是努力尊重这个总有混乱和微妙、依然隐藏谜团的真相，从而为捷克作家米兰·昆德拉所谓的“记忆与遗忘的斗争”出上自己的一份力。

Hui make up less than 1 percent of the population and have historically assimilated well with the ethnic Han majority, regarding Arabic architectural features, such as domes and minarets, as proof of unwanted foreign influence over Islam in China. A town billboard shows a rendering of the government’s plan: the dome gone, the minarets decorated with pagoda-like tiers. 
回族占人口的比例不到1%，历史上与占人口多数的汉族同化良好。将穹顶和宣礼塔等阿拉伯建筑特征斥为外国对中国伊斯兰教产生有害影响的证据。镇上一个广告牌展示着政府改造方案的效果图：穹顶没有了，宣礼塔变成了类似佛塔的建筑。

Yunnan Province, where both Nagu and Shadian are, is China’s most ethnically diverse, and the Hui people — most of whom speak Mandarin but are distinguished by their Muslim faith — have lived there for centuries. The earliest version of Nagu’smosque was built in the 14th century, in a traditional Chinese courtyard style. Yunnan’s Muslims prospered as merchants trading with Southeast Asia.
纳古和沙甸所在的云南省是中国少数民族最多的省份，而大多数人都说普通话、以穆斯林信仰著称的回族已在云南各地生活了几个世纪。纳古的清真寺始建于14世纪，带有传统的中国庭院风格。云南的穆斯林因为与东南亚的贸易而繁荣起来。

In Canada, a country known for its picturesque landscapes and orderliness, the out-of-control wildfires have stoked national anxiety. They have also stretched firefighting resources in a sprawling and decentralized country where firefighting is managed at the provincial level, and made coordination more difficult at a time when global warming has intensified the wildfire season.In Ottawa, the capital, the feeling of a country under siege was highlighted on Wednesday by the sight of a thick haze hovering over Parliament Hill and over the soaring Gothic Revival building that is part of Canada’s Parliament in Ottawa.Smoke obscured the New York City skyline on Wednesday, turning the outlines of its skyscrapers into ghostly silhouettes.
在以风景如画和秩序井然著称的加拿大，失控的野火引发了全国人民的焦虑。在一个庞大而分散的国家，消防工作由省级管理，野火令消防资源紧张，并在全球变暖加剧野火季的情况下，使协调工作变得更加困难。周三，在加拿大首都渥太华，浓浓的雾霾笼罩在议会山和加拿大议会大楼高耸的哥特复兴式建筑上空，令人感觉整个国家已被重重包围。周三，烟雾笼罩了纽约市的天际线，将摩天大楼的轮廓变成了幽灵般的剪影。

In Canada, the wildfires have exerted a heavy human toll, including displacing tens of thousands of people. The level of unpredictability caused by the blazes is so high that provincial wildfire authorities in British Columbia have warned local residents to have a go-bag at the ready, along with an evacuation plan.hundreds of blazes across the country have stretched local resources thin, and renewed calls for a national firefighting service.In Ottawa, the Ottawa Redblacks, the city’s Canadian Football League team, switched from outdoor to indoor practice. 
在加拿大，野火造成了严重的人员伤亡，包括令数万人流离失所。大火造成的不可预测性非常高，因此不列颠哥伦比亚省负责管理野火的有关部门警告当地居民准备好应急行李，并制定撤离计划。全国各地数以百计的大火已经使当地资源捉襟见肘，令人们再次呼吁建立国家消防服务。在渥太华，该市的全加足联球队渥太华红黑队已经改在室内训练。

As smoke seeped into theaters in New York City, alarming both ticket holders and performers, the Broadway production of “Hamilton” and a Free Shakespeare in the Park production of “Hamlet” both canceled performances.the air quality index in the broader New York City region surpassed 400, Such a reading indicates that the air is unhealthy for all people, not just the vulnerable, and is somewhat typical in smoggy megacities like Jakarta or New Delhi. 
随着烟雾渗入纽约市的剧院，观众和表演者都感到恐慌，百老汇的《汉密尔顿》和“公园里的免费莎士比亚”的《哈姆雷特》都取消了演出。纽约市整个地区的空气质量指数超过了400，这样的读数表明，空气对所有人都是不健康的，而不仅仅是弱势群体。这在雅加达或新德里等雾霾大城市是很典型的情况

Health authorities have warned that fire smoke could cause symptoms ranging from sore and watery eyes to coughing, dizziness, chest pains and heart palpitations. Some health officials have advised residents to wear protective masks, conjuring bad memories of pandemic times.
卫生部门警告，烟雾可能导致从眼部刺痛、流泪到咳嗽、眩晕、胸痛和心悸等许多症状。一些卫生官员建议居民佩戴保护性口罩，从而激起大流行时代的痛苦回忆。

In Ottawa on Wednesday, Bogdan Wozniak, 72, a distraught hot-dog stand vendor, said his business had always been weather dependent, but smoke or fire were other-level challenges. “For smoke you cannot be prepared,” he said. “You have the mask,” he said. “That’s all.”“I’ll be lucky if I break even today,” he added.
周三在渥太华，72岁的热狗摊主博格丹·沃兹尼亚克忧心忡忡地说，他的生意向来很受天气的影响，但那跟野火带来的挑战一比就不算什么了。“烟雾要来，没什么可准备的，”他说。“顶多也就是戴个口罩。”“今天能回本就很不错了，”他接着说。

And if you had asked me before Monday’s announcement whether I thought Apple’s mixed-reality headset signified the beginning of a huge, earthshaking platform shift, on the order of the original iPhone’s arrival, I would have said no.Part of my open-mindedness to the Vision Pro, I admit, is due to a kind of tech columnist PTSD. That’s a testament to the company’s famous product and marketing prowess. And it’s part of why I’m reluctant to dismiss the Vision Pro’s chances.
如果有人在周一的发布会之前问我，怎么看苹果的这个混合现实头戴设备，它是否像第一代iPhone的到来那样，标志着一个巨大的、翻天覆地的平台转变的开始，我会给予否定的回答。我承认，我愿意对Vision Pro持开放态度，部分原因是技术专栏作家的某种“一朝被蛇咬、十年怕井绳”。那是对这家公司大名鼎鼎的产品开发和营销能力的见证，也是我不愿轻易排除Vision Pro成功机会的部分原因。

Now, we assume that people who check their watches at dinner are probably trying to avoid pulling out their phones, which would be ruder and more disruptive. In other words, mass adoption killed the taboo.That may be because virtual and augmented reality are fundamentally bad ideas, and the market for these devices may be destined to remain small. But it could be that the market just needed Apple to arrive. A few years from now, if you’re reading this on your Vision Pro, or in an Apple device attached directly to your corneas, don’t say I didn’t warn you.
我们现在的假设是，那些晚餐时看手表的人也许是在尽量避免看手机，那会更没礼貌、更打搅他人。换句话说，用的人多了，以前的禁忌就不存在了。这可能是因为，虚拟现实和增强现实从根本上来说不是好想法，因此这类设备的市场注定不会大。但也可能是这个市场需要苹果的到来。如果几年后，你正在用Vision Pro或用直接贴在你角膜上的Apple设备阅读这篇文章的话，别说我没有事先告诉你。

People will throw potshots at the process any time they’re arrested; that is common,But if you rob a bank and I arrest you, and you threaten to throw a hand grenade at the courthouse, the problem is not that I arrested you for robbing a bank.
人在被捕的时候总是会对司法程序发起肆意的攻击，这很常见，但如果你抢了一家银行，我逮捕了你，你威胁要向法院扔手榴弹，那么错不在我因为你抢劫银行而逮捕你。

Mr. Trump was charged with a total of seven counts, including willfully retaining national defense secrets in violation of the Espionage Act, making false statements and an obstruction of justice conspiracy, according to people familiar with the matter.The indictment, filed by the office of the special counsel Jack Smith, came about two months after local prosecutors in New York filed more than 30 felony charges against Mr. Trump in a case connected to a hush money payment to a porn star in advance of the 2016 election.
据知情人士称，特朗普被指控的罪名共有七项，包括违反《间谍法》故意保留国防机密、做出虚假陈述，以及妨碍司法公正。这份起诉书由特别检察官杰克·史密斯的办公室提交，大约两个月前，纽约当地检察官对特朗普提起了30多项重罪指控，那起案子与他在2016年大选前向一名色情明星支付封口费有关。

Last August, federal agents descended on Mar-a-Lago to conduct an extraordinary search that turned up material that Mr. Trump had failed to turn over in response to a subpoena months earlier demanding the return of any classified documents still in his possession.
去年8月，联邦特工突访马阿拉歌庄园，进行了一次特别搜查，发现了特朗普未能交出的材料——几个月前他曾接到传票，要求归还仍在他手中的所有机密文件。

Throughout 2016, he castigated Hillary Clinton for using a private email server instead of a secure government one. “I’m going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information,” he declared. “No one will be above the law.” Mrs. Clinton’s cavalier handling of the sensitive information, he said, “disqualifies her from the presidency.”
整个2016年，他都在谴责希拉里·克林顿使用私人电子邮件服务器而不是安全的政府服务器。“我会执行所有关于保护机密信息的法律，”他宣称。“没有人可以凌驾于法律之上。”他说，希拉里对敏感信息的漫不经心意味着“她没资格当总统”。

Even in the what-goes-around-comes-around department of American politics, it is rather remarkable that the issue that helped propel Mr. Trump to the White House in the first place now threatens to ruin his chances of getting back there.
最初帮助特朗普入主白宫的问题现在有可能毁掉他重返白宫的机会，即使放在美国政治诸多“出乎尔反乎尔”的事例里，这件事都是非同一般的。

Seeking to dominate the strategic waterways of Asia, China has deployed an armada of boats that are equipped with 76-millimeter cannons and anti-ship missiles, In just a decade, China has amassed the world’s largest coast guard fleet, and it is like no other.Japan later announced a plan to upgrade its coast guard and fold it into the Ministry of Defense.
为了控制亚洲的战略航道，中国部署了一支配备76毫米舰炮和反舰导弹的舰队，在短短十年间，中国已经建起了世界最大且独一无二的海警舰队。日本后来宣布了一项升级海岸警卫队并将其并入防卫省的计划。

The coast guard, in China’s eyes, would be a pillar of its rejuvenation as a world power because it would help Beijing control important waterways (and their fishing and mining riches) without spurring a military response from countries flummoxed by the fleet’s not-quite-military heft.
在中国眼中，海警将成为其大国复兴的支柱，因为它将帮助北京控制重要水域（以及那里的渔业和矿产资源），海警力量没有达到军事标准，因此不会激起其他国家的军事反应。

A reduction in the deposit rates is one lever that policymakers can use to stimulate spending. The hope is that the lower rates will give consumers an incentive to spend or invest money instead of parking their savings in the bank.
降低存款利率是政策制定者可以用来刺激支出的一个杠杆，希望较低的利率能激励消费者消费或投资，而不是将积蓄存入银行。

They cram themselves every day by the millions onto India’s overtaxed trains, chasing a shred of economic opportunity across the vastness of the world’s most populous nation.Tickets costing about $5 — nearly a day’s wage — are all they can afford. For that, they stand shoulder to shoulder over long stretches in the middle of so-called general category coaches, far removed from the air-conditioned cars that lie beyond the pantry where workers prepare the rice, roti and chai for the journey.The railway calamity has once again highlighted how unevenly the burden of India’s inadequate infrastructure falls on the poor.
每天，成百上千万印度人挤上超负荷的火车，在这个世界上人口最多国家的广阔土地上追逐些许经济机会。他们只买得起五美元的票——几乎是一天的工资。为此，他们要在远离空调车厢的所谓的普通车厢长时间挤在中间的过道上。空调车厢位于餐车附近，员工们在那里为乘客的旅途准备米饭、烤饼和茶。铁路灾难再次凸显出，印度基础设施不足带来的负担更多由穷人承受。

It is an affordable lifeline for the tens of millions of young people who must uproot themselves to scrape out a living.The biggest impediment to improving safety and performance on the Indian network is dangerous levels of congestion.That puts strain not only on the tracks, but also on the staff working on those tracks, and does not allow sufficient time for maintenance.
对于数千万必须背井离乡才能维持生计的年轻人来说，这是一条平价的生命线。提高印度铁路网络安全性和性能的最大障碍是危险的拥堵水平。这不仅给铁轨带来了压力，也给铁轨上的工作人员带来了压力，而且没有足够的时间进行维护。

The lucky ones who survived had to pick themselves up and carry on with their search for a living — or return home, broken.They could count one thing in their good fortune: The cyclone-prone state of Odisha, the site of the crash, has a well-oiled disaster relief system that rushed to the rescue and saved lives.
生还的幸运者必须振作起来，继续寻找生计，或者颓丧地返回家园。还有一件事对他们来说也很幸运：事发地所在的奥里萨邦飓风频

At bottom, he’s a humongous, dangerous liar and a criminal. As Logan Roy would say, this is not a serious person.The dramatic unsealing of United States of America v. Donald J. Trump is a fitting switch. Until now, it has been Donald J. Trump v. United States of America. He tried to engineer a coup against the government he was running. I bet Jack Smith will be bringing those charges later.
那是一个大号的、危险的骗子和罪犯。就像洛根·罗伊说的，他不是个正经人。美利坚合众国诉唐纳德·J·特朗普案的戏剧性开审是一个恰当的转折。此前一直是唐纳德·J·特朗普诉美利坚合众国。他试图策划一场政变，推翻他所领导的政府。我赌杰克·史密斯稍后会提出这些指控。

You can’t purloin classified documents; leave them in the gilt-and-crystal glare of the bathroom, shower, bedroom and ballroom at Mar-a-Lago; and show them off to remind people how important you are. Trump’s ego is his greatest weakness. He couldn’t resist self-aggrandizing. Hey, I got these secret documents.
你不能窃取机密文件；把它们留在马阿拉歌庄园那些金光闪闪的浴室、盥洗室、卧室和舞厅；然后把它们拿出来炫耀，提醒别人你有多重要。特朗普的自负是他最大的弱点。他忍不住自吹自擂。嘿，我有这么多机密文件。

Despite official claims to the contrary, many Saudis can’t help but frame their growing ties with China in contrast to the waning influence of the United States in the kingdom.This was the 10th Arab-China business conference, but the first time it had been hosted by Saudi Arabia, and by far the largest iteration of the event. 
尽管官方的说法与此相反，但许多沙特人还是不由自主地将他们与中国日益增长的关系与美国在沙特日益减弱的影响力相提并论。这是第十届中阿合作论坛，但首次由沙特阿拉伯主办，也是迄今为止规模最大的一次。

The death of Silvio Berlusconi on Monday brought to an end one of the longest, most consequential and colorful eras in Italian politics, with both ardent admirers and die-hard critics marking a life of outsized influence as something that split contemporary Italian history into the before and after.He will receive a state funeral in Milan’s Duomo on Wednesday.
西尔维奥·贝卢斯科尼周一去世，结束了意大利政治中最长、最重要、最艳丽的时代，狂热的崇拜者和顽固的批评者都视其影响力巨大的一生为意大利当代历史的分水岭。他的国葬将于周三在米兰大教堂举行。

His fans, who for years sang, “Thank Goodness There’s Silvio,” say he was a force of nature that modernized Italian politics, matured its democracy and added capitalist dynamism to a creaky economy overly reliant on government.His detractors saw him as the very personification of the country’s political and cultural decline, a crooked businessman who entered politics to protect his business interests, a womanizing caricature of the Italian libertine who cozied up to despicable strongmen from Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya to Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
多年来一直唱着“谢天谢地，有西尔维奥”的粉丝们说，他是一股不可抵抗的力量，使意大利政治现代化，使民主成熟，并为过度依赖政府的腐朽经济增添了资本主义活力。他的批评者认为他是该国政治和文化衰落的化身，一个为了保护自己的商业利益而进入政界的狡猾商人，一个拈花惹草的意大利浪荡子，讨好拉拢从利比亚的卡扎菲到俄罗斯普京的各种卑劣强人领袖

He embodied multitudes of contradictory personas: The reformer who promised to liberalize the country, but then governed like a populist. The family man whose long list of young companions, especially at so-called Bunga Bunga bacchanals, both scandalized the country and endeared him to aspiring Lotharios. The committed ally and lover of America who became an apologist for Mr. Putin and his invasion of Ukraine. The candidate who, in a clear conflict of interest, used his television channels as a political cudgel.
他一人身兼多个相互矛盾的角色：一名承诺要使国家自由化的改革者，随后却像民粹主义者一样执政。这个顾家的男人有一长串的年轻伴侣，尤其是在被称为“蹦加蹦加”(Bunga Bunga)的酒会上，这既是让举国震动的丑闻，也让有同样追求的登徒子对他爱戴有加。他是美国坚定的盟友和情人，却又为普京及其乌克兰入侵辩护。在明显存在利益冲突的情况下，这位候选人将他的电视频道用作政治棍棒。

That cultural shift to the spectacular and tawdry has not only remained on the airwaves, but critics have argued it has pervaded all of Italian society, transforming the way people look and the ambitions and dreams of a generation of Italians who hungered for the wealth and confidence that Mr. Berlusconi, transactional and aspirational and gaudy, stood for.
批评者认为，这种向排场和俗气文化的转变不仅持续在电视广播中，还渗透到整个意大利社会，改变了人们的外表以及一代意大利人的抱负和梦想，他们渴望贝卢斯科尼——关系交易，野心勃勃，华而不实——所代表的财富和自信。

The former center-left prime minister, Matteo Renzi, whom Mr. Berlusconi apparently once saw as a potential successor before double-crossing (after Mr. Renzi double-crossed him), has sought to regain relevance by positioning himself as the heir of the moderate Italian center that Mr. Berlusconi once controlled.Mr. Renzi, a consummate political operator, has licked his chops at the chance of vacuuming up Mr. Berlusconi’s parliament members and once again controlling enough support to become vital in Italian politics, either to prop up or take down Ms. Meloni’s government.
前中左翼总理马泰奥·伦齐似乎曾被贝卢斯科尼视为潜在的继任者，但后来他出卖了伦齐（在伦齐出卖他之后）。伦齐试图将自己定位为一度由贝卢斯科尼控制的意大利温和中间派的继承人，从而重新赢得关注。伦齐是一位老练的政治操盘手，等不及要开始拉拢贝卢斯科尼的议员，并再次获得足够的支持，成为意大利政坛的关键人物，无论最终是要支持还是推翻梅洛尼的政府。

The worriers have often used a simple metaphor. If you ask a machine to create as many paper clips as possible, they say, it could get carried away and transform everything — including humanity — into paper clip factories.For many experts, this did not seem all that plausible until the last year or so, Or so the theory goes. Other A.I. experts believe it is a ridiculous premise.
爱担忧的人常使用一个简单的比喻。他们说，如果你要求一台机器尽可能多地制造回形针，机器可能会忘乎所以，将所有的东西——包括人类——变成制造回形针的工厂。对于许多专家来说，这种可能性直到差不多去年之前似乎还没有那么可信。或按照该理论的说法是这样的。其他人工智能专家认为，这是个荒谬的假定。

Mr. Leahy argues that as researchers, companies and criminals give these systems goals like “make some money,” they could end up breaking into banking systems, fomenting revolution in a country where they hold oil futures or replicating themselves when someone tries to turn them off.A.I. systems like ChatGPT are built on neural networks, mathematical systems that can learn skills by analyzing data.
莱希认为，随着研究人员、公司和犯罪分子给这些系统设定“赚钱”等目标，它们可能以不好的结果告终，如侵入银行系统，在它们持有石油期货的国家煽动革命，或者在有人试图将它们关掉时复制自己。ChatGPT这样的AI系统是建立在神经网络上的数学系统，通过分析数据来学习技能。

Because they learn from more data than even their creators can understand, these systems also exhibit unexpected behavior. Researchers recently showed that one system was able to hire a human online to defeat a Captcha test. When the human asked if it was “a robot,” the system lied and said it was a person with a visual impairment.
用来训练这些系统的数据量之大，使得系统创造者也无法理解全部数据，因此这些系统会表现出创造者意想不到的行为。研究人员最近报告说，一个系统能在网上雇人来击败验证码检验。当人问系统是不是“机器人”时，系统撒谎说，它是有视力障碍的人。

In the early 2000s, a young writer named Eliezer Yudkowsky began warning that A.I. could destroy humanity. His online posts spawned a community of believers. Called rationalists or effective altruists, this community became enormously influential in academia, government think tanks and the tech industry.
本世纪初，一个名叫艾利泽·尤德科夫斯基的年轻作家开始警告AI可能毁灭人类。他发在网上的文章培养了一群信奉者。这个被称为“理性主义者”或“实际利他主义者”（简称EA）的群体后来在学术界、政府智囊团以及科技行业产生了巨大影响。

Maybe you can’t sleep. Or you sleep too much. Maybe you keep breaking out, or getting sick. Perhaps your stomach bloats, your skin sags, you feel shaky. Maybe you can’t focus, eat or get rid of the tension in your spine.When we experience stress, the pea-size pituitary gland in the brain — sometimes called the master gland — signals to the adrenal glands perched atop the kidneys, prompting them to secrete and deliver cortisol into our bloodstream.
也许你睡不着。也许你睡得太多。也许你的皮肤一直爆痘，或者总是生病。也许你有胃胀气，皮肤松弛，感觉身体虚弱。也许你无法集中注意力，吃不下东西，或者总觉得脊背发紧。当我们承受压力时，大脑中豌豆大小的垂体腺——有时被称为主腺体——会向位于肾脏上方的肾上腺发出信号，促使它们分泌皮质醇并将其输送到我们的血液中。

We release cortisol when we encounter a tangible threat, like coming across a bear on a hike, but also when we receive an ominous work email. The more threatening we perceive an event to be, the more cortisol we typically produce. The mind and the body will respond as if we were in danger of dying, when actually what’s happening is that our sense of self is being threatened
当我们遇到明显威胁时，比如在徒步时遇到熊，我们会释放皮质醇，但当我们收到不想看到的工作邮件时也会释放皮质醇。当我们感知到一件事越具有威胁性，通常就会产生更多的皮质醇。身心会做出反应，就好像我们处于死亡的危险之中，而实际上受到威胁的是我们的自我意识

This is a gift from evolution: Cortisol helps us mobilize the energy we need to confront, or flee from, danger, partly by raising the amount of glucose in our blood. It also regulates our metabolism. Our levels fluctuate throughout the day, rising when we first wake up and falling as we drift off to sleep,Cortisol is your friend,until there’s too much of it.
这是进化带来的礼物：在对抗或逃离危险时，皮质醇通过提高我们血液中的葡萄糖含量，在一定程度上帮助我们调动所需的能量。它还调节我们的新陈代谢。我们的皮质醇水平全天都在波动，当我们第一次醒来时会上升，而当我们逐渐入睡时会下降。皮质醇是你的朋友，但太多了就不好了。

The situation often plays out like this: Parents arrange to marry their daughter off to a returning Indian. They pay a dowry, a practice long banned in India but still common. A lavish wedding follows, with days of food and alcohol and dancing to Punjabi music. Then comes a honeymoon, also paid for by the bride’s family.Left-behind women can be found everywhere in Punjab — a sign that the desperation to leave outweighs the many cautionary tales.Some women are fighting to have their husbands’ passports impounded. 
情况通常是这样的：父母安排将女儿嫁给一个从国外回来的印度人。他们支付嫁妆，这种做法在印度早就被禁止，但仍然普遍存在。接下来进行一场奢华的婚礼，包括提供几天的餐食和酒饮，并随着旁遮普音乐跳舞。然后是蜜月，同样由新娘的家人支付。在旁遮普，留守女性随处可见——这表明离开的迫切愿望让她们无视了许多前车之鉴。一些妇女正在争取扣押丈夫的护照。

Senator Graham grinned next to the prince — known by his initials M.B.S. — during a visit to Saudi Arabia in April. Also this week, Mr. Monahan jolted the world of professional golf by announcing a planned partnership between the PGA and the upstart Saudi-backed LIV Golf league, suddenly giving the kingdom tremendous global influence over the sport.It just tells you how money talks because this guy sits on top of this oil well and all this money, so he can basically buy his way out of everything
参议员格雷厄姆今年4月访问沙特阿拉伯时，露着笑脸与人称MBS的王储合影。就在本周，莫纳汉宣布PGA与沙特支持的新贵LIV高尔夫联盟建立合作伙伴关系的计划，震惊了职业高尔夫界，并突然赋予了沙特王国对这项运动的巨大全球影响力。这只是在告诉人们财大气就粗，因为这个人拥有石油和所有这些钱，所以他基本上可以用钱解决一切

Along the way, he has not only sharpened his vision for the future of Saudi Arabia as an assertive regional power with a growing economy and increased political clout, but has taken lessons from his setbacks to refine his methods for achieving his goals.For now, at least, he appears to be riding high.
与此同时，穆罕默德王储不仅强化了经济不断增长、政治影响力越来越大的沙特作为自信的区域大国的未来，而且还从他的挫折中吸取教训，改进了实现目标的方法。至少现在，他似乎获得了成功。

He also knows that, as the king-in-waiting in a monarchy, he can play the long game. Early on, he sidelined rivals to consolidate his control at home. Social changes he has pushed through, like allowing women to drive and expanding entertainment options in a country that used to ban movie theaters, have won him fans among the kingdom’s youth.
他也知道，作为君主制的王储，他能做长远打算。他曾在掌权的早期排挤对手，巩固了自己对国内的控制。他推动的社会变革，例如允许女性开车、在这个曾经禁止电影院的国家扩大人们的娱乐选择等，为他在沙特年轻人中赢得了粉丝。

Although she struck an accommodating tone, Ms. Yellen also laid out concerns likely to arise in meetings with her Chinese counterparts.I certainly do not think it is in our interest to stifle the economic progress of the Chinese people,China has succeeded in lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, and I think that’s something that we should applaud.These institutions reflect American values,It serves as an important counterweight to nontransparent, unsustainable lending from others.
尽管耶伦措辞温和，但她也提出了与中国相关官员会面时可能出现的担忧。我当然不认为扼杀中国人民的经济发展符合我们的利益，中国已经成功地让数亿人摆脱了贫困，我认为这是我们应该赞扬的事情。这些机构反映了美国的价值观，它可以作为砝码制衡来自其他国家的不透明、不可持续的贷款。

he keeps pushing and pushing our system to its breaking point — where rules are for suckers, norms are for fools, basic truths are malleable and men and women of high character are banished.This is exactly what would-be dictators try to do: Flood the zone with lies so the people trust only them and the truth is only what they say it is.It is impossible to exaggerate what a dangerous moment this is for our country.
他一直在推动我们的系统走向崩溃的临界点——在这种时刻，傻瓜才谈规则，傻瓜才谈规范，基本真理是可以改变的，品格高尚的男人和女人被排斥。这正是准独裁者试图做的事情：用谎言淹没这个地方，让人们只相信他们，而真相只有他们所说的那样。这对我们国家来说是一个多么危险的时刻，无论怎么强调都不过分。

Their convoys got bogged down and became sitting ducks for Ukrainian troops armed with shoulder-fired missiles. Mr. Putin’s plans to take the entire country have not come to fruition.The Russian military has constructed trenches, minefields, dragon’s teeth and other barriers to slow Ukrainian forces during offensive operations.Could Ukraine use an element of surprise?
他们的车队陷入困境，成为配备肩扛式导弹的乌克兰军队的活靶子。普京占领整个国家的计划没有实现。在进攻行动中，俄罗斯军方建造了战壕、雷区、龙牙桩和其他障碍物，以减缓乌克兰军队的行动速度。乌克兰可以出其不意吗？

During World War II, Germany used reinforced concrete pyramids to repel Allied tanks. The general idea was that rows of the evenly spaced structures — some with land mines nestled between them — would force tanks into positions where they could be more easily targeted.The pyramids were called dragon’s teeth because, at about three to four feet tall, they resembled a fanged mouth.
第二次世界大战期间，德国使用金字塔形状的钢筋混凝土结构来逼退盟军的坦克。大致的构想是，一排排均匀间隔的结构——其中一些结构之间隐藏着地雷——将迫使坦克进入更容易成为标靶的位置。这种金字塔结构被称为龙牙，因为它们大约有1米到1.2米高，像长满獠牙的嘴。

South Korea’s culinary tradition tends to result in uneaten food. Small side dishes — sometimes a few, sometimes more than a dozen — accompany most meals. For years, practically all of those leftovers went into the ground.But the country’s mountainous terrain limits how many landfills can be built, and how far from residential areas they can be. In 1995, the government introduced mandatory recycling of paper and plastic, but food scraps continued to be buried along with other trash.When all of that went to waste, it emitted a terrible stench
韩国的烹饪传统往往带来剩余食物。大多数时候，一顿饭的小配菜少则几样，多则十几样。多年来，几乎所有的剩菜都埋到地下。但该国的多山地形限制了垃圾填埋场的数量，而且无法与居民区拉开距离。1995年，政府推行纸张和塑料的强制回收规定，但厨余垃圾继续与其他垃圾一起掩埋。扔掉的厨余垃圾会发出可怕的臭味。

At Jongno Stew Village, a popular lunch spot in the Dobong district of northern Seoul, pollock stew and kimchi jjigae are the best sellers. But no matter the order, Lee Hae-yeon, the owner, serves small side dishes of kimchi, tofu, boiled bean sprouts and marinated perilla leaves.
在首尔北边道峰区颇受欢迎的午餐食肆钟路炖村，鱼干汤泡饭和泡菜锅最受欢迎。无论点什么菜，店主李熹延（音）都会端上各种小菜，包括泡菜、豆腐、煮豆芽和腌紫苏叶。

Debris — bones, seeds, shells — is picked out by hand. (Dobong’s plant is one of the last in the nation where this step isn’t automated.) A conveyor belt carries the waste into a grinder, which reduces it to small pieces. Anything that isn’t easily shredded, like plastic bags, is filtered out and incinerated.Then the waste is baked and dehydrated. The moisture goes into pipes leading to a water treatment plant, where some of it is used to produce biogas. The rest is purified and discharged into a nearby stream.
残渣——骨头、种子、壳类——是手工捡出来的。（道峰的工厂是该国最后几家未将这一步自动化的工厂之一。）传送带将废物送入研磨机粉碎成小块。任何不容易切碎的东西，比如塑料袋，都会被过滤掉并焚烧。然后将废物烘烤和脱水。水分进入管道通往水处理车间，其中一些被用来生产沼气。其余的被净化并排放到附近的溪流中。

Japan has also made strides against two perennial problems, with wages and inflation improving in recent months. Consumer prices, excluding fresh food, rose 3.4 percent in April, the highest level in decades. Rising inflation is more welcome in Japan than it is in the United States and Europe because it has been mired at such low levels for so long, and the Japanese central bank has indicated it will stick with monetary easing.
日本在两个长期存在的问题方面也取得了长足进步，最近几个月工资和通货膨胀有所改善。不包括生鲜食品的消费者价格在4月上涨3.4%，为数十年来的最高水平。由于日本的通胀长期处于极低水平，相比在美国和欧洲，日本更乐于见到通胀，日本央行已表示将坚持货币宽松政策。

Birthday best wishes rarely come freighted with so much significance.“It is difficult to overestimate the effort that you have made over many years to strengthen our comprehensive partnership and the strategic interaction between our countries,” Mr. Putin wrote.In Beijing, Russia is regarded as a vital partner against an increasingly united and antagonistic West.In particular, China has become more concerned about alienating Europe
生日祝福很少有这么重要的意义。“你多年来为加强两国战略协作伙伴关系所做的贡献难以估量，”普京在贺电中写道。在中国，俄罗斯则被视为重要伙伴，以对抗日益团结和敌对的西方。尤其是，中国越来越担心疏远欧洲

But there is also an asymmetry built in. China is a bigger animal. It is a robust manufacturing, scientific power. Russia is mostly a one-dimensional economy. This now is a trend line on steroids.I would say the Chinese are aware of Russian sensitivities, particularly in the past 10 to 15 years, and don’t want to, as we say in Chinese, drop a stone on someone already at the bottom of the well
但这种关系也有内在的不对称。中国是更大的一方，中国有强大的制造业和科研力量。俄罗斯主要是个单一维度的经济体。这个趋势现在正在加速发展。我要说的是，中国人知道俄罗斯人的敏感之处，尤其是在过去的10年、15年里，所以不想落井下石

Two bipartisan bills introduced in Congress this week aim to change a nearly 100-year-old trade rule that allows imported packages that fall under a certain price threshold to receive less oversight in the U.S. customs process.The trade rule is called “de minimis,” and critics say it gives an unfair advantage to foreign e-commerce companies,Currently, companies importing packages valued under $800 are not charged duties, taxes or fees by the U.S. government.
本周在国会提出的两项两党法案旨在改变一项近100年历史的贸易规则，该规则允许低于一定价格门槛的进口包裹在美国海关通关过程中受到较少监管。这项贸易规则被称为“低额豁免”，批评人士说，它给外国电子商务公司提供了不公平的优势，目前，美国政府不向进口价值低于800美元包裹的公司征收关税、税收或其他费用。

Shein has become popular among U.S. shoppers for its ultralow prices and sophisticated mobile app and website. Its $11 smock dresses and $6 floral print bikinis are shipped directly to shoppers, allowing it to bypass import fees.Since entering the U.S. market in 2012, Shein has been compliant with U.S. tax and customs laws.
Shein凭着极低的价格和先进的移动应用程序及网站，在美国消费者中很受欢迎。其售价11美元的罩衫裙和售价六美元的印花比基尼可以绕过进口税费，直接发货给购物者。自2012年进入美国市场以来，Shein一直遵守美国的税收和海关法律。

Washington faces its own domestic pressures not to appear soft; a tougher approach to China has become a rare area of bipartisan consensus. With both sides staking out seemingly intractable positions, few officials and experts harbor hope of any major breakthroughs from Mr. Blinken’s visit.At the heart of Beijing’s chilly posture toward Mr. Blinken’s visit is its claim that American overtures are insincere, and its treatment of China unjust. For Blinken, he walks into China under conditions of strategic terra incognita,This is all new ground.
美国也面临不能表现出软弱的国内压力；对中国采取更强硬的态度已成为两党罕有的共识。由于双方都摆出了看似不可调和的立场，基本没有官员和专家对布林肯的访问能取得重大突破抱有希望.中方对布林肯访华态度冷淡，根本原因在于它声称美国的姿态并不真诚，给中国的待遇也并不公正.布林肯访华所面临的是战略上的未知之地，这是一种全新的局面。

During President Donald J. Trump’s years in the White House, his aides began to refer to the boxes full of papers and odds and ends he carted around with him almost everywhere as the “beautiful mind” material.It was a reference to the title of a book and movie depicting the life of John F. Nash Jr., the mathematician with schizophrenia played in the film by Russell Crowe, who covered his office with newspaper clippings, believing they held a Russian code he needed to crack.
特朗普总统入主白宫的几年里，几乎走到哪里都要带着装满文件和零碎物品的箱子，助手开始称之为“美丽心灵”材料。《美丽心灵》是一本讲述小约翰·纳什生平的书，被拍成同名电影。纳什是一名患有精神分裂的数学家，在影片中由罗素·克劳饰演，他在办公室里贴满了剪报，认为里面有他需要破解的俄罗斯密码。

The phrase had a specific connotation. The aides employed it to capture a type of organized chaos that Mr. Trump insisted on, the collection and transportation of a blizzard of newspapers and official documents that he kept close and that seemed to give him a sense of security.
这个词有特定的内涵。助手们用它来概括特朗普坚持的一种有组织的混乱，他收集和运输大量报纸和官方文件，把它们带在身边，这似乎给了他一种安全感。

Even if Trump is convicted and imprisoned, he could continue to run for office and even presumably hold the office of president, if he isn’t too busy in the prison factory making license plates.A plausible guess, based in part on the latest polling since the federal indictment, is that prosecutions could help him in the Republican primaries while hurting him in the general election. Looking ahead, news organizations must not drop the ball as they did in 2016, giving Trump a platform without adequately fact-checking him. We should enable democracy, not empower an antidemocratic demagogue.
即使特朗普被定罪并入狱，也可以继续竞选公职，甚至可能担任总统职位，如果他不忙于在监狱工厂制造车牌的话。部分基于联邦起诉后的最新民意调查，一个合理的猜测是，起诉可能会在共和党初选中帮助他，但在大选中会伤害他。展望未来，新闻机构绝不能像2016年那样掉以轻心，在没有对特朗普进行充分事实核查的情况下给他一个平台。我们应该支持民主，而不是为反民主的煽动者赋权。
