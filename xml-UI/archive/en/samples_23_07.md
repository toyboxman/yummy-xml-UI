In the Supreme Court decision striking down racial and ethnic preferences in college admissions, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. had harsh words for Harvard and the University of North Carolina, calling their admissions process “elusive," “opaque” and “imponderable.”We remain vigilant and intend to initiate litigation should universities defiantly flout this clear ruling
在最高法院推翻大学招生种族和族裔偏好的裁决中，首席大法官约翰·罗伯茨对哈佛大学和北卡罗来纳大学措辞严厉，称其招生过程“难以捉摸”、“不透明”和“无法预料”。我们保持警惕，如果有大学公然藐视这一明确的裁决，我们打算提起诉讼。

It’s kind of a Bud Light moment,” he said, referring to the beer company’s ill-fated hiring of a transgender spokeswoman that led to a boycott.There could also be pressure to blow up the entire process, eliminating preferences for the children of alumni and donors, who tend to be white and wealthy.
“这有点像是百威风波，”他说，该啤酒公司因聘请跨性别人士代言而遭到抵制，损失惨重。压力也可能破坏整个过程，并取消对校友和捐赠人子女的优待，这些人往往是富有的白人群体。

For the Russian public, and the military rank and file, the aftermath of the rebellion is a moment of whiplash, Leonid Ivashov, a retired senior Russian general who has spoken out against the war but has remained in Russia, summarized the overarching question hanging over society and the military thus: “What is going on?” he has seen Moscow’s Kremlin-connected elite rally to Mr. Putin’s side as he seeks to telegraph strength.
对俄罗斯公众和普通将士来说，叛乱给他们带来的冲击是巨大的，曾公开反对战争但没有离开俄罗斯的高级退役将领列昂尼德·伊瓦绍夫这样总结笼罩在社会和军队之上的最大问题：“怎么会变成这样？”他已经看到，在普京欲彰显实力之时，与克里姆林宫有关系的莫斯科精英都站到了普京这一边。

She and other creators enlisted by Shein highlighted tidy stacks of clear Shein packages, robots moving merchandise and rows of happy workers.But rather than win hearts and minds, Shein and the creators have been roundly blasted in the past week by social media users who have viewed the videos incredulously. 
她和其他参加了这次Shein付费旅行的创作者们在他们发的内容中展示了整齐摆放的干净Shein包裹、搬运商品的机器人，以及一排又一排的快乐工人。但Shein和这几名创作者非但没有赢得人心，反而在过去一周里受到社交媒体用户的猛烈抨击，他们对这些视频充满怀疑。

And the trip has become a cautionary tale for marketers, as Shein’s efforts to help its reputation using influencers managed to alienate consumers and draw even more attention to allegations of unsavory business practices.It required such a suspension of disbelief and clearly came across as a sort of propaganda.
这次旅行已经成为营销人员的反面教材：Shein用网红来提升自己声誉的努力反而疏远了消费者，并引起了人们对不良商业行为指控的更多注意。这需要人们在很大程度上收起疑心，因为这看上去显然是一种宣传。

Shein, which has reportedly been contemplating an initial public offering, has been trying to drum up good will after years of being relatively tight-lipped. The company started a unit for reselling its apparel to stave off criticism about sustainability, tapped independent designers to create new lines and hired federal lobbyists.the gaslighting is CRAZY! I can take accountability for myself and my actions but I can’t take the fall for Shein.
据报道，Shein一直在考虑首次公开募股，公司在保持了多年相对沉默之后，一直在努力赢得好感。公司成立了一个二手服装部门，以避免人们对其产品不可持续的批评，聘请独立设计师为其设计新产品，还请来游说机构在联邦政府替其说话。这种心理操纵太疯狂了！因为我可以为自己和我的行为负责，但我不能为Shein承担责任代人受过。

In the immediate aftermath of the Wagner rebellion, a visibly angry Mr. Putin gave televised speeches to the nation, railing against those he described as traitors and vowing punishment. Since then, the Kremlin has announced that the charges against the mutineers would be dropped, and that Mr. Prigozhin would decamp to Belarus.
瓦格纳事件发生后不久，怒容满面的普京向全国发表了电视讲话，斥责那些被他称为叛徒的人，并发誓要惩罚他们。此后，克里姆林宫宣布将撤销对叛变者的指控，普里戈任将逃往白俄罗斯。

A seemingly sanguine Mr. Putin then appeared at the technology fair in Moscow, where he was shown new facial recognition technology and advanced printers, and he joked about a Russian cartoon character, Garbage Toad. The outing occurred a day after he was seen in the southern region of Dagestan, sipping local brandy and speaking about growing regional tourism.
随后，看上去情绪高涨的普京出现在莫斯科的科技博览会上，会上向他展示了新的面部识别技术和先进的打印机，他还拿俄罗斯卡通人物“垃圾蟾蜍”开玩笑。就在这次外出的前一天，有人看到他在达吉斯坦南部地区喝着当地的白兰地，谈论着日益增长的地区旅游业。
