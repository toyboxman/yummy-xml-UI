In the Supreme Court decision striking down racial and ethnic preferences in college admissions, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. had harsh words for Harvard and the University of North Carolina, calling their admissions process “elusive," “opaque” and “imponderable.”We remain vigilant and intend to initiate litigation should universities defiantly flout this clear ruling
在最高法院推翻大学招生种族和族裔偏好的裁决中，首席大法官约翰·罗伯茨对哈佛大学和北卡罗来纳大学措辞严厉，称其招生过程“难以捉摸”、“不透明”和“无法预料”。我们保持警惕，如果有大学公然藐视这一明确的裁决，我们打算提起诉讼。

It’s kind of a Bud Light moment,” he said, referring to the beer company’s ill-fated hiring of a transgender spokeswoman that led to a boycott.There could also be pressure to blow up the entire process, eliminating preferences for the children of alumni and donors, who tend to be white and wealthy.
“这有点像是百威风波，”他说，该啤酒公司因聘请跨性别人士代言而遭到抵制，损失惨重。压力也可能破坏整个过程，并取消对校友和捐赠人子女的优待，这些人往往是富有的白人群体。

For the Russian public, and the military rank and file, the aftermath of the rebellion is a moment of whiplash, Leonid Ivashov, a retired senior Russian general who has spoken out against the war but has remained in Russia, summarized the overarching question hanging over society and the military thus: “What is going on?” he has seen Moscow’s Kremlin-connected elite rally to Mr. Putin’s side as he seeks to telegraph strength.
对俄罗斯公众和普通将士来说，叛乱给他们带来的冲击是巨大的，曾公开反对战争但没有离开俄罗斯的高级退役将领列昂尼德·伊瓦绍夫这样总结笼罩在社会和军队之上的最大问题：“怎么会变成这样？”他已经看到，在普京欲彰显实力之时，与克里姆林宫有关系的莫斯科精英都站到了普京这一边。

She and other creators enlisted by Shein highlighted tidy stacks of clear Shein packages, robots moving merchandise and rows of happy workers.But rather than win hearts and minds, Shein and the creators have been roundly blasted in the past week by social media users who have viewed the videos incredulously. 
她和其他参加了这次Shein付费旅行的创作者们在他们发的内容中展示了整齐摆放的干净Shein包裹、搬运商品的机器人，以及一排又一排的快乐工人。但Shein和这几名创作者非但没有赢得人心，反而在过去一周里受到社交媒体用户的猛烈抨击，他们对这些视频充满怀疑。

And the trip has become a cautionary tale for marketers, as Shein’s efforts to help its reputation using influencers managed to alienate consumers and draw even more attention to allegations of unsavory business practices.It required such a suspension of disbelief and clearly came across as a sort of propaganda.
这次旅行已经成为营销人员的反面教材：Shein用网红来提升自己声誉的努力反而疏远了消费者，并引起了人们对不良商业行为指控的更多注意。这需要人们在很大程度上收起疑心，因为这看上去显然是一种宣传。

Shein, which has reportedly been contemplating an initial public offering, has been trying to drum up good will after years of being relatively tight-lipped. The company started a unit for reselling its apparel to stave off criticism about sustainability, tapped independent designers to create new lines and hired federal lobbyists.the gaslighting is CRAZY! I can take accountability for myself and my actions but I can’t take the fall for Shein.
据报道，Shein一直在考虑首次公开募股，公司在保持了多年相对沉默之后，一直在努力赢得好感。公司成立了一个二手服装部门，以避免人们对其产品不可持续的批评，聘请独立设计师为其设计新产品，还请来游说机构在联邦政府替其说话。这种心理操纵太疯狂了！因为我可以为自己和我的行为负责，但我不能为Shein承担责任代人受过。

In the immediate aftermath of the Wagner rebellion, a visibly angry Mr. Putin gave televised speeches to the nation, railing against those he described as traitors and vowing punishment. Since then, the Kremlin has announced that the charges against the mutineers would be dropped, and that Mr. Prigozhin would decamp to Belarus.
瓦格纳事件发生后不久，怒容满面的普京向全国发表了电视讲话，斥责那些被他称为叛徒的人，并发誓要惩罚他们。此后，克里姆林宫宣布将撤销对叛变者的指控，普里戈任将逃往白俄罗斯。

A seemingly sanguine Mr. Putin then appeared at the technology fair in Moscow, where he was shown new facial recognition technology and advanced printers, and he joked about a Russian cartoon character, Garbage Toad. The outing occurred a day after he was seen in the southern region of Dagestan, sipping local brandy and speaking about growing regional tourism.
随后，看上去情绪高涨的普京出现在莫斯科的科技博览会上，会上向他展示了新的面部识别技术和先进的打印机，他还拿俄罗斯卡通人物“垃圾蟾蜍”开玩笑。就在这次外出的前一天，有人看到他在达吉斯坦南部地区喝着当地的白兰地，谈论着日益增长的地区旅游业。

How is it in our interest to allow them to get technology that they may turn around and use against us? “If they were in our shoes, they would do exactly the same thing,” he said, adding that the U.S. was imposing “very targeted, very narrowly defined controls.”
允许他们获取可能被反过来用于对付我们的技术，这怎么会符合我国利益呢？“如果调换立场，他们也会做同样的事情，”他说，并补充称美国正在实施“非常具有针对性、范围非常狭窄的管控措施”。

No credible names emerged, and within a few days Mr. Putin had re-established at least a veneer of equilibrium in Russian politics, with a series of appearances designed to convey a firm grip on power and enduring popularity.He was tapping into dissatisfaction with an unaccountable system and a detached elite amid Russian losses on the battlefield.
没有可信的人选出现，在几天之内，普京至少在俄罗斯政治中重新建立了一种平衡的表象，他的一系列露面旨在传达他对权力的牢牢掌控和持久的声望。当俄罗斯在战场上失利的情况下，他利用了人们对不问责的制度和冷漠精英的不满。

He asked Mr. White, who heads the world’s premier mixed martial arts competition, which is fought in cage-like rings, if Mr. Musk was serious about a fight.If you thought that a cage fight between two of the world’s richest men was just a far-fetched social media stunt, think again.
他问怀特，马斯克是否真的想与他比赛。怀特是世界一流综合格斗比赛的负责人，这些比赛是在笼子一般的擂台上进行的。如果你认为世界上两位最富有的人之间的笼斗只是社交媒体上不靠谱的噱头，那你就大错特错了。

If the matchup between Mr. Musk, 52, and Mr. Zuckerberg, 39, goes ahead, it would be a rare spectacle, even in the braggadocio-filled universe of the tech industry. While Steve Jobs and Bill Gates used to snipe at each other.Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Musk have long teetered between being competitors, frenemies and outright enemies. Mr. Zuckerberg is likely in fighting shape.
如果52岁的马斯克和39岁的扎克伯格之间的对决如约而至，即使在吹牛人士遍地的科技行业，这也将是一场罕见的奇观。虽然史蒂夫·乔布斯和比尔·盖茨过去常常互相攻击.扎克伯格和马斯克的关系长期以来一直在竞争对手、亦敌亦友和彻底的敌人之间摇摆不定。扎克伯格的身体素质可能适合格斗。

Last month, he posted a personal record for completing the “Murph” challenge, which requires completing a series of pull-ups, push-ups, running multiple miles and doing hundreds of squats, all while wearing weighted, military-grade body armor.“Don’t encourage this match!” she recently tweeted, along with two frowning emojis.
上个月，他发布了完成“墨菲”挑战的个人记录，该挑战需要完成一系列引体向上、俯卧撑、跑步数英里和进行数百次深蹲，在进行所有这些项目的同时还必须穿着负重的军用级防弹衣。“不要怂恿这场比赛！”她最近发了一条推文，并附上了两个皱眉的表情符号。

Chinese officials are still smarting at the Biden administration’s 2022 decision to place significant limitations on the kinds of advanced semiconductors and chip-making machinery that can be sent to China. Those limits have hampered China’s efforts to develop artificial intelligence. The Biden administration’s subsidy program to strengthen the U.S. semiconductor industry has also rankled Chinese officials, Beijing swiped back on Monday, announcing that it will restrict the export of certain minerals used in the production of some chips. that does not seem to be in the offing. 
2022年，拜登政府在的决定严格限制可被运往中国的先进半导体和芯片制造机械的种类，中国官员对此仍感到不快。这些限制阻碍了中国开发人工智能,拜登政府加强支持美国半导体行业的补贴计划也引起了中国官员的不满.北京周一做出回击，宣布将对用于生产某些芯片的特定矿物出口设限。但这似乎不会很快实现。

In June, international creditors including China agreed to a debt relief plan with Zambia that would provide a grace period on its interest payments and extend the dates when its loans are due. The arrangement did not require that the World Bank or International Monetary Fund write off any debts, offering global policymakers like Ms. Yellen hope for similar debt restructuring in poorer countries.
6月，包括中国在内的国际债权方与赞比亚达成了一项债务减免计划，为赞比亚的利息支付提供宽限期，并延长其贷款到期日。这项计划无需世界银行或国际货币基金组织勾销债务，因而让包括耶伦在内的全球政策制定者看到了在较贫穷国家进行类似债务重组的希望。

But in an American political climate that rewards hyperbole and alarm, Ms. Park, who became a U.S. citizen in 2021, has found a lucrative niche.She is a regular guest on popular right-leaning TV networks and podcasts, and speaker at conservative universities and think tanks.Her recent trajectory has drawn winces from some past allies and supporters, who worry about the toll that her dive into the American culture wars may take on her effectiveness as a human rights advocate.She’s very smart. She’s always picking up on keywords.
但在鼓励夸大其词和散播担忧的美国政治气候下，于2021年成为美国公民的朴研美找到了有利可图的一席之地。她是热门右倾电视网络和播客的常客，也是保守派大学和智囊团的演讲者。她最近的变化引起了一些过去盟友和支持者的退缩，他们担心她卷入美国文化战争可能会影响她作为人权倡导者的效果。她非常聪明。她总是在关键词上做文章。

In her new book, however, Ms. Park writes about being disenchanted by her brush with elites. They were more interested in emotional gratification than in action, she came to believe.Disenchanted With the Gala Circuit
然而，在她的新书中，朴研美写到，与精英的接触令她失望。她开始相信，他们更感兴趣的是情感上的满足，而不是行动。对精英不再抱幻想

Why are we rewarding children for privileges and advantages accrued by prior generations?Your family’s last name and the size of your bank account are not a measure of merit, and should have no bearing on the college admissions process.The complaint from liberal groups comes days after a conservative group, Students for Fair Admissions, won its Supreme Court case. And it adds to accelerating pressure on Harvard and other selective colleges to eliminate special preferences for the children of alumni and donors.
为什么我们要把先辈积累的特权和优势当做给孩子的奖励？家族姓氏和银行账户里的金额并非成绩的衡量标准，也不应影响大学录取的结果。就在自由派团体发起申诉前不久，保守派组织“学生公平录取”(Students for Fair Admissions)在最高法院赢得了诉讼。此案给哈佛大学等名校带来了更大的压力，要求它们取消对校友和捐赠者子女的优待。

Colleges argue that the practice helps build community and encourages donations, which can be used for financial aid.As we said, in the weeks and months ahead, the university will determine how to preserve our essential values, consistent with the court’s new precedent.if the Supreme Court “was serious about their ludicrous ‘colorblindness’ claims, they would have abolished legacy admissions, aka affirmative action for the privileged.” a typical white legacy applicant’s chances of being admitted increase fivefold over a typical, white non-legacy applicant.
一些大学辩称，此类招生有助于建立校园社区文化，鼓励捐款，而这些捐款可以用于学费补助。正如我们所说，在未来数周到数月时间里，本校将依据法院新判例来决定如何维护我们的基本价值观。如果最高法院“对其荒谬的‘种族色盲’主张是认真的，那他们就应该废除继承式录取，也就是属于特权阶层的平权行动”。典型的白人继承申请者的录取机会比典型的白人无继承申请者高出五倍。

And for India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, the meeting’s host, it was a way to signal his country’s rising stature — and to land a thinly veiled jab at its archrival, Pakistan, by calling for other nations to unite in a “fight against terrorism.” He touted the Shanghai Cooperation Organization as a way to “improve global governance” and promote “Chinese-style modernization” — coded language that expresses a vision of the world in which Beijing and its partners have a greater say in international rules and norms.A high-profile visit to Washington last month by Mr. Modi has intensified Chinese suspicions that India is drawing closer to the United States to blunt China’s rise.
对于会议东道主印度总理莫迪来说，这是表明印度地位正在不断提升的信号——还可以通过呼吁其他国家团结起来“打击恐怖主义”，向其主要竞争对手巴基斯坦发起含沙射影的攻击。他称赞上海合作组织是“改善全球治理”和促进“中国式现代化”的一种方式——这种隐晦的措辞表达了北京及其合作伙伴在国际规则和规范中拥有更大发言权的世界愿景。莫迪上个月高调访问华盛顿，加剧了中国的怀疑，即印度正在拉近与美国的关系，以遏制中国的崛起。

On Monday, the police emphasized the extraterritorial reach of the regulations, which criminalize activities endangering China, even if they had taken place outside Hong Kong and mainland China. They said the accused had violated provisions on foreign collusion and inciting secession.
周一，警方强调了香港国安法的治外法权，该法将危害中国的活动定为犯罪，即使这些活动发生在香港和中国大陆境外。警方称八名被通缉者涉嫌与外国勾结、煽动分裂国家。

Mr. Grossi will visit Seoul on Friday to discuss the rising anxiety in South Korea, where salt prices have surged in recent weeks after people started hoarding sea salt harvested from salt ponds on the country’s west coast ahead of​ the discharge.The South Korean government has tried to dispel fears among its residents by vowing to ramp up efforts to monitor seawater, fisheries and natural salt farms for any rise in radioactive substances.
格罗西将于周五访问首尔，就韩国日益加剧的焦虑情绪探讨对策。近几周，由于民众都赶在排放之前囤积产自韩国西海岸盐池的海盐，盐价出现大幅上涨。韩国政府已经放话，要加大力度检测海水、渔业和天然盐场中放射性物质的含量，试图消除民众的恐惧。

The nine-dash line is used in Chinese maps to mark its claim over as much as 90 percent of the South China Sea. “Barbie” was banned because of “the illegal image of the ‘cow’s tongue line’ in the film,” using the common Vietnamese phrase for the nine-dash line.
中国地图会用九段线来标示南海90%的海域都属于中国。《芭比》被禁是因为“片中出现‘牛舌线’的违规画面”。“牛舌线”是越方对九段线的常见代称。

The Obama administration announced an end to America’s decades-long enmity with the Cuban government, that bet began to pay off. Then Donald Trump entered the White House and it all fell apart. In 2019, he imposed the harshest economic sanctions in more than a half-century. A month later, Cuba began rationing soap, eggs, rice and beans. 
巴马政府宣布结束美国对古巴政府长达几十年的敌意，这个预期开始得到回报。唐纳德·特朗普入主白宫后，这一切都破裂了。2019年，特朗普对古巴实施了半个多世纪以来最严厉的经济制裁。一个月后，古巴开始定量配给肥皂、鸡蛋、大米和豆子。

China and several other Asia Pacific countries were reeling from monsoonal floods and stultifying temperatures on Wednesday, the latest disruptions in what forecasters say could be a long summer and autumn of extreme weather around the world.At the same time, much of the region was baking in sweltering temperatures.
周三，中国和其他几个亚太国家遭受了季风性洪水和闷热高温的影响。气象预报者表示，世界各地今年夏秋季极端天气的持续时间可能会更长，这是该说法的最新例子。与此同时，东亚大部分地区都在遭受热浪袭击。

Combining the flavor and texture of Eastern music with the orchestral color and sensitive lyrics of Western culture, the magic of this stunningly beautiful film is truly realized in this evocative love ballad.
将东方音乐的韵味和质感与西方文化的管弦乐色彩和敏锐的歌词相结合，这部令人惊艳的电影的魔力在这首动人的情歌中得到了真正的体现

The Chinese are very aware of the U.S. election cycle, and in my mind this is partly why they have been willing to be a little more open,Both Secretary Yellen and the Chinese would like to get back to a place where they see at least parts of the economic relationship as a positive-sum game, rather than a zero-sum game.I will always champion your interests and work to make sure there is a level playing field
中国人非常了解美国的选举周期，在我看来，这就是他们愿意更加开放的部分原因，财长耶伦和中国人都希望回到这样的状态，即至少将部分经济关系视为正和游戏，而不是零和游戏。我将始终捍卫你们的利益，努力确保公平的竞争环境

The United States under President Biden has pledged to cut emissions roughly in half by 2030.Combined with tougher pollution limits on tailpipes and smokestacks proposed by Mr. Biden, the law could put the U.S. within striking distance of its goal.Mr. Kerry said he intended to urge China to accelerate its phase-out of coal, to combat deforestation and issue a plan to reduce emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that leaks from oil and gas wells. 
拜登总统领导下的美国承诺到2030年将排放量减少大约一半。拜登还提出对排气管和烟囱实施更严格的污染限制，这项法律可能将使美国距离目标近在咫尺。克里表示，他打算敦促中国加快淘汰煤炭、打击森林砍伐，并发布一项减少甲烷排放的计划，甲烷是一种从石油和天然气井泄出的强效温室气体。

Amid the ruins of a city ravaged by World War II, Karl Haeusgen’s grandfather invented a hydraulic pump he was so proud of that he founded a company to sell it. Back then, there were no revenue projections or five-year growth strategies. The plan was survival: “It was just about grabbing chances,”In Kaufbeuren, a brightly painted Bavarian town nestled below the Alps, Hawe is a top employer. On the Hawe factory floor, the anxieties it sparked still linger.
在遭受“第二次世界大战”重创的城市废墟中，卡尔·霍伊斯根的外祖父发明了一种液压泵。外祖父对这项发明非常自豪，于是成立了一家公司来销售它。那时候没有收入预测，也没有五年增长战略，计划就是生存下去：“成立公司只是为了抓住机会，”考夫博伊伦是坐落在阿尔卑斯山下的一座色彩斑斓的巴伐利亚小镇，哈威是它的最大雇主.这个事件引发的焦虑仍然在哈威工厂的车间里挥之不去。

Staking out a socioeconomic transformation for the country, pledged by Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition government, has become a source of national anxiety.Some are resistant to adapting to new technologies and cling to a loyalty-based system that created lifetime employees — and customers.The government, too, has a poor record in shedding outdated practices — like its labyrinth, paperwork-based bureaucracy. 
德国总理奥拉夫·朔尔茨联合政府承诺的国家社会经济转型已成为全国焦虑的来源。有些人拒绝适应新技术，仍坚持以忠诚为基础的体系，这种体系让员工在企业工作一辈子，也为企业提供了永久客户。德国政府在改变过时做法方面——比如迷宫般的、以文书工作为基础的官僚机构——也表现不佳。

Marita Riesner, inspecting parts, said her heating costs spiked to 740 euros ($803) a month from 120 euros ($130). She and her neighbors are growing vegetable gardens to ease the pain of inflation as the country dips into recession.The new socioeconomic model for Germany may be less about erecting pillars than managing an ever more intricate, international juggling act.
正在检查零件的玛丽塔·里斯纳说，她的取暖费用已从每月 120欧元（约合950元人民币）飙升到740欧元（约合5800元人民币）。随着国家陷入经济衰退，她和邻居们开始自己种菜，以缓解通货膨胀的痛苦。德国的新的社会经济模式可能不是建立支柱，而是管理更复杂的国际平衡。

Isaac Newton was baffled. He was already famous for discovering how gravity holds the universe together and for using that knowledge to predict the movements of celestial bodies, such as the moon’s path around the Earth. Now, by taking the sun’s gravitational tugs into account, he sought to improve his lunar predictions. Instead, it made them worse.
艾萨克·牛顿被难住了。他已经名声在外，因为他发现了引力是如何将宇宙凝聚在一起的，并利用这一知识来预测天体的运动，例如月球围绕地球的轨迹。现在他要将太阳的引力拖曳考虑在内，试图改进他的月球预测。然而这反而导致问题的恶化。

Yellen’s trip will hardly change the underlying dynamic and trajectory of the economic relationship.In a meeting with Premier Li Qiang, China’s second-highest official, he mentioned that a rainbow had appeared overhead upon her arrival and suggested it was a symbol of hope that ties between the two countries could be mended.
耶伦此行很难改变根本的政治动态和经济关系的轨迹。与李强总理会晤时，这位中国二号官员提到，耶伦抵达首都机场时天空中出现了一道彩虹，并表示这象征了两国关系能够得到修复的希望。

The authorities have often attributed the attacks to people with “grudges” or those seeking “revenge on society.” Experts and some officials have suggested that the attackers are acting out of frustration with China’s rapidly changing society and social stressors such as unemployment. But mental health resources in China remain sparse, and the social safety net thin.
当局往往将袭击归咎于这些人心怀“怨恨”或想要“报复社会”。专家和一些官员曾表示，这些袭击者是对中国快速变化的社会以及失业等社会性压力感到不满。但中国的心理健康医疗资源仍然匮乏，社会保障网也很薄弱。

His daughter, Yan Lan, confirmed the death in a statement in the Chinese magazine Caixin. She did not specify a cause, but Mr. Yan had endured a succession of illnesses in old age.“Dad passed away peacefully, putting a full stop on a life filled with tumult and drama,” Ms. Yan wrote.By 1989, Mr. Yan was the head of the Chinese Communist Party’s United Front Department, which handled relations with intellectuals as well as with ethnic and religious groups.
他的女儿阎兰在中国的《财新》杂志发表文章，证实了他的死讯。她没有说明具体死因，但阎明复晚年患有多种疾病。“爸爸平静地走了，为他波澜跌宕的一生画上了句号，”阎兰写道。1989年，阎明复任中共统战部部长，该部负责处理与知识分子以及少数民族和宗教团体的关系。

The United States must face up to its own problems, and must not shy away from diseases,Attacking and smearing China will not cure the chronic problem of drug abuse in the United States, but will only delay the problem of drug control in the United States into a greater social crisis.Fentanyl has virtually no domestic market in China, and analysts say that has given Beijing less incentive to regulate its precursor chemicals, which also have an array of legal uses in the medical industry.Washington’s approach smacks of arrogance to China because the Biden administration is trying to dictate the terms of engagement.
美方必须正视自身问题，不能讳疾忌医，攻击抹黑中国治不了美国国内毒品泛滥的痼疾，只会将美国毒品治理问题拖延成更大的社会危机。分析人士指出，芬太尼在中国国内几乎没有市场，北京方面因此没有太多动力对它的前体化学品进行监管，这种化学品在医疗行业也有着广泛的合法用途。美国的做法在中国看来是傲慢的，因为拜登政府试图主导两国接触的方式。

It could amount to the most consequential diplomatic push of Mr. Biden’s presidency. He is betting that high-level dialogue can itself act as a ballast in a relationship that has been in a dangerous free fall for years. 
这可能成为拜登总统任期内最重要的外交推动。几年来，两国关系一直处于危险的自由落体状态，拜登认为高层对话本身可以稳定两国关系。

Surveys have shown that young people are deterred by the toll of putting a child through China’s cutthroat education system. But the anxieties that underpin why so many people are saying no to marriage are not easy to address.
调查显示，让孩子经历中国残酷的教育体系的代价导致许多年轻人不想生孩子。但导致这么多人抗拒婚姻的焦虑并不容易解决。

The mutiny exposed Putin’s inability or unwillingness to deal with a power struggle that for months had raged in the open, with Prigozhin regularly launching profanity-laced invective at Russia’s military leadership on Telegram. Stanovaya, who is also a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said she suspected Putin felt at least partly responsible for not better managing the escalating feud.Facing a major loss of power, Prigozhin railed loudly against the move, to no avail.
这次哗变暴露了普京没有能力或不愿意应对数月来公开激烈的权力斗争，普里戈任经常在Telegram上对俄罗斯军事领导层口出恶言。同为卡内基俄罗斯欧亚中心高级研究员的斯坦诺瓦娅表示，她觉得普京至少感到自己对未能更好地处理不断升级的不和负有部分责任。面对权力遭受重大损失，普里戈任大声抱怨，但无济于事。

A prominent Wagner commander, Anton Yelizarov, who goes by the nom de guerre Lotos, gave an interview to a Russian war blogger on Friday, from southern Russia.As for society and normal people, you can see for yourself: girls are walking around with patches that they coaxed off our guys, most likely for kisses. Boys are wearing T-shirts and hats with our logos. Little kids are playing war games, with the Ukrainians as the Germans and Wagner PMC fighters as the Red Army.
人称洛托斯的瓦格纳著名指挥官安东·叶利扎罗夫周五在俄罗斯南部接受了一位俄罗斯战争博主的采访，至于社会和普通人，你们可以自己去看看：女孩们戴着我们的徽章到处走动，那可能是她们从我们的军人那里以接吻的方式骗来的。男孩们穿着印有我们标识的T恤和帽子。小孩子们正在玩战争游戏，乌克兰人是德国人，瓦格纳PMC战士是红军。

Mr. Zuckerberg needs people to be able to find friends and influencers on Threads in the serendipitous and sometimes weird ways that Twitter managed to accomplish. He needs to make sure Threads isn’t filled with spam and grifters.If you launch a gimmick app or something that isn’t fully featured quite yet, it might be counterproductive and you could see a lot of people churn right back out the door.Yet bolting on a new app to a company’s existing products can eventually run out of steam.
扎克伯格希望人们能够在Threads上找到朋友和有影响力的人，就像Twitter以偶然、有时甚至是奇怪的方式设法做到的那样。他需要确保Threads不是一个充斥着垃圾邮件和诈骗者的地方。如果你推出一款噱头应用程序或功能尚不完善的应用程序，可能会适得其反，你可能会看到很多人很快就离开了。然而，将一款新应用与公司现有产品捆绑在一起，最终可能导致虎头蛇尾的结果。

NATO leaders convening this week in Vilnius, Lithuania, have every reason to toast their success.Only four years ago, on the eve of another summit, the organization looked to be in low water; in the words of President Emmanuel Macron of France, it was undergoing nothing short of “brain death.” This turnabout has understandably energized the alliance’s supporters. 
本周在立陶宛维尔纽斯召开会议的北约国家领导人有充分理由庆祝成功。就在四年前，在另一次峰会前夕，该组织似乎处于低潮；用法国总统马克龙当时的话说，它正处于“脑死亡”状态。这一转变理自然令北约的支持者为之一振。

NATO, from its origins, was never primarily concerned with aggregating military power.Rather, it set out to bind Western Europe to a far vaster project of a U.S.-led world order, in which American protection served as a lever to obtain concessions on other issues, like trade and monetary policy. In that mission, it has proved remarkably successful.No matter their ascendance, Atlanticists fret over support for the organization being undermined by disinformation and cybermeddling. Today, dissent is less audible than ever before.
北约从一开始就不是以集结军事力量为主要目的。相反，它的计划是将西欧与美国主导的世界秩序这个更为宏大的项目绑定在一起，在这个项目下，美国的保护作为一种杠杆，令美国在贸易和货币政策等其他问题上获得让步。事实证明，北约的这一使命非常成功。无论占有何等优势，大西洋主义者都担心虚假信息和网络干预破坏了对该组织的支持。今天，异议的声音比以往任何时候都少。

When European populations proved too stubborn, or undesirably swayed by socialist or nationalist sentiments, Atlantic integration proceeded all the same. The Czech Republic was a telling case. Faced with a likely “no” vote in a referendum on joining the alliance in 1997, the secretary general and top NATO officials saw to it that the government in Prague simply dispense with the exercise
当欧洲民众被证明过于顽固，或者受到社会主义或民族主义情绪的不利影响时，大西洋一体化仍在继续。捷克共和国就是一个很好的例子。1997年，在是否加入北约的全民公决中，面对可能的“反对”投票，北约秘书长和北约高级官员决定让布拉格政府干脆取消这次公决

Whatever the levels of expenditure, it is remarkable how little military capability Europeans get for the outlays involved. Lack of coordination, as much as penny-pinching, hamstrings Europe’s ability to ensure its own security. By forbidding duplication of existing capabilities and prodding allies to accept niche roles, NATO has stymied the emergence of any semiautonomous European force capable of independent action.
无论支出水平高低，欧洲人的军事能力与相关支出相比完全不成比例。缺乏协调和锱铢必较都会削弱欧洲确保自身安全的能力。北约禁止现有能力的重叠，并敦促盟国接受特殊角色，以此阻挠能够独立行动的半自治欧洲部队的出现。

If the controls are successful, they could handicap China for a generation; if they fail, they may backfire spectacularly, hastening the very future the United States is trying desperately to avoid. The outcome will likely shape U.S.-China competition, and the future of the global order, for decades to come. 
如果这些控制措施成功，可能会影响中国一代人的进步；如果失败，可能会产生惊人的适得其反的结果，美国在极力避免的那个未来会更快发生。这一结果可能会影响未来几十年的中美竞争以及全球秩序的未来。

Despite the immense intricacy of their design, semiconductors are, in a sense, quite simple: tiny pieces of silicon carved with arrays of circuits. The circuits flip on and off based on the activity of switches called transistors. When a circuit is on, it produces a one; off, a zero. The first chips, invented in the late 1950s, held only a handful of transistors. Today the primary semiconductor in a new smartphone has between 10 and 20 billion transistors, each about the size of a virus, carved like a layer cake into the structure of the silicon.
尽管半导体的设计非常复杂，但从某种意义上说也非常简单：在微小硅片上雕刻大量的电路。被称为晶体管的开关控制着电路的通断。当电路接通时是1；当电路断开时是0。第一批芯片于1950年代末发明，只包含少量晶体管。如今，新型智能手机中的主要半导体拥有100至200亿个晶体管，每个晶体管只有病毒大小，像层叠蛋糕一样雕刻在硅结构中。

But total domestic investment in China in the quarter was $1.5 trillion, he said, adding that U.S. venture capital and private equity flows “are not even a rounding error.”Mr. Perry retorted, “They’re grifters, like you are, sir,” eliciting gasps from both sides of the aisle.
他说，但今年一季度的中国国内投资总额达1.5万亿美元。他补充说，流入中国的美国风险资本和私募股权投资“甚至不够（投资总额的）舍入误差”。佩里反驳称“他们跟你一样都是骗子，先生”，引来两党的惊诧连连。

The hearing underscored the tightrope Mr. Kerry walks in seeking cooperation with Beijing while Republicans and some Democrats try to outdo each other with tough rhetoric on China. It also exposed how little leverage the United States has to pressure the Chinese government to act faster to cut its carbon emissions.
Mr. Kerry said, insisting it would be “malpractice of the highest order, diplomatic and political,” for the United States not to hold talks with China.
在共和党人和部分民主党人竞相拿出强硬对华措辞之际，此次听证会凸显了克里在寻求与北京合作过程中的两难处境，它也暴露了美国在向中国政府施压，促使其采取更快行动减少碳排放的问题上几乎没有多少主动权。克里表示，他坚持认为，如果美国不肯与中国

President Biden and his national security team have contended since he took office that all the easy, tempting comparisons between this era and the Cold War are misleading, a vast oversimplification of a complex geopolitical moment.
拜登总统和他的国家安全团队自上任以来一直主张，人们容易忍不住拿这个时代和冷战比较，这是有误导性的，是对复杂地缘政治时刻的过度简单化。

Word that Uruguay was seeking a trade deal with China prompted exultation at El Álamo ranch, a lush expanse of grass punctuated by cactus and herds of cattle on the eastern plains of Uruguay.Bring on the trade agreement,That would level the playing field for us.But the enthusiasm pervading this South American country has more recently given way to resignation that a trade deal with China is unlikely to happen anytime soon. What beckoned as a fresh opportunity for Uruguay has devolved into a cautionary tale of the pitfalls of trade policy for small nations grappling with complex geopolitical realignments.
乌拉圭正在寻求与中国达成贸易协议，这个消息曾让埃尔阿拉莫牧场的人们欣喜若狂。这座牧场坐落在乌拉圭东部平原，仙人掌和牛群零星地点缀在郁郁葱葱的草地上。签署贸易协议吧，这将为我们提供公平的竞争环境。但这个南美国家弥漫的热情最近已经消散，因为人们认定不太可能与中国很快达成贸易协议。对乌拉圭来说，一个新的机遇已经变成了一个警示故事，提醒人们当小国在应对复杂的地缘政治变化时，贸易政策可能会带来隐患。

But the greatest source of concern centered on the consequences of a potential rupture within Mercosur, which was formed in 1991.Mercosur operates as a collective to set tariffs with the rest of the world.Mercosur is widely seen as falling far short of its aims to catalyze a common market in South America. Its putative designs on fostering trade have frequently been impeded by the interests of politically powerful industries in Brazil and Argentina. 
但最令人担忧的是1991年成立的南方共同市场内部可能分裂带来的后果。南方共同市场作为一个集体共同制定与世界其他国家的关税。乌拉圭在寻求与中国单独达成协议的过程中破坏了该组织的团结。人们普遍认为南方共同市场远远没有达到其促进南美共同市场的目标。巴西和阿根廷政治力量强大的产业的利益常常阻碍该联盟所推定的促进贸易的计划。

On Monday, both sides sought to strike a warm note,Mr. Kerry said the science was unequivocal indicating that intensified heat waves, floods and other extreme weather events have been driven heavily by climate change.The dirtiest of fossil fuels, coal releases more carbon emissions upon burning than natural gas.
周一，双方都力求表现热情，克里表示，科学已经无可辩驳地表明，高温、洪水和其他极端天气事件的加剧在很大程度上是由气候变化造成的。煤炭是污染最严重的化石燃料，燃烧时释放的碳排放量多于天然气。

Talking about the short term, like the recent thaw in relations between the U.S. and China, I don’t think the economy has much effect,China has little incentive to make compromises regardless of broader economic issues.the latest batch of data suggests that economic pressures could continue to intrude on geopolitical objectives. And the investment picture has gotten murky. China has a lot at stake economically. 
就短期而言，我不认为经济对中美关系最近的缓和有太大影响，无论更广泛的经济问题如何，中国几乎没有做出妥协的动力.这批最新的数据暗示，经济压力可能会继续扰乱其地缘政治目标。投资前景也已变得黯淡。中国在经济上有许多利害攸关的领域。

The White House is intent on outcompeting China on technology. The ground on which this competition is taking place is chip making. But the Biden administration shouldn’t sit back and savor this accomplishment for one reason: What if its core belief — that advanced semiconductors are one of the critical fronts in the contest — is wrong?
白宫决心在技术方面超越中国，芯片制造领域则是这场比赛的竞技场。但拜登政府不应该放松并满足于现在的成就，一个原因是：先进半导体是竞争的一条关键战线，如果这一核心信念是错的该怎么办？

With one hand, the U.S. government is blocking China’s progress on A.I. and supercomputing, but with the other, it is ushering Chinese companies toward concentrating their efforts on chips for products of daily use. And a world in which Chinese companies dominate the production of mature chips — driven directly by American policy — hardly looks like a victorious outcome for the United States.
美国政府一方面阻止中国在人工智能和超级计算方面取得进展，另一方面又引导中国企业将精力集中在日常产品的芯片上。在美国政策的直接推动下，中国公司在成熟芯片生产领域占据主导地位，这对美国而言很难说算是胜利成果。

The problem with trying to regulate fast-moving technologies is that there will always be new loopholes to close. That’s especially the case since American chip makers are constantly dreaming up clever ways to maintain their access to the enormous Chinese market. Administrative agencies risk being bogged down in games of Whac-A-Mole while losing sight of strategic objectives.That means broadening the strategic focus to a wider range of sectors and following through on plans to build unglamorous technologies, too.
对快速发展的技术进行监管的问题在于，总会有新的漏洞需要填补。尤其是美国芯片制造商一直在想方设法保持进入庞大中国市场的机会。政府部门可能会陷入打地鼠游戏，因而忽视战略目标。这意味着要将战略重点扩大到更广泛的领域，同时也要贯彻开发平凡技术的计划。

In the sandstone desert of China’s far west, a local meteorological station recorded an all-time high temperature of 126 degrees. In central China, heat-induced mechanical problems trapped tourists riding on a cable car in midair.In the southeastern city of Hangzhou, a heavy storm on Monday left the city “steaming like a sauna,” according to local media, as raindrops turned to steam upon hitting the scorching pavement. Other cities have opened air raid shelters to residents looking to cool off.
中国最西部的大沙漠中，当地气象站录得52.2摄氏度的有记录以来最高气温。在中国中部，高温天气导致机械故障，将乘坐缆车的游客困在半空。据当地媒体报道，杭州周一降了一场暴雨，落到灼热人行道上的雨滴蒸发，这座城市“路面如桑拿一般热气腾腾”。还有些城市为找地方躲避高温的居民开放了防空洞。

The heat has been most intense in Xinjiang’s Turfan Depression, where the desert climate makes it regularly one of the hottest parts of China. The surface temperature in the Flaming Mountains there, a popular tourist spot of barren red sandstone, reached 176 degrees on Sunday, China’s state broadcaster said. The air temperature record, of 126 degrees, was measured in a township nearby.
新疆吐鲁番盆地的高温天气最为严重，那里的沙漠气候使其成为中国最炎热的地区之一。国家电视台称，火焰山周日的地表温度达到了80摄氏度，由贫瘠的红砂岩构成的火焰山是一个热门旅游景点。附近一个小镇记录了52.2摄氏度的气温。

Look no further than the pickle Ford is in now. By 2026, Ford wants to start selling electric vehicles outfitted with batteries made of a chemical cocktail known as L.F.P. — lithium, iron, and phosphate — to the American market. L.F.P. batteries can be charged more quickly and more often than the cobalt and nickel batteries that Ford uses today; they’re also cheaper and more rugged and the minerals are easier to source.This was, apparently, exactly the kind of situation that Biden’s climate law was meant to set up.Republicans, too, blanched at the partnership. 
看看福特现在所处的困境就知道了。福特希望到2026年开始向美国市场销售配备“锂铁磷”电池的电动汽车，锂铁磷指的是锂、铁和磷酸的化学混合物。与福特目前使用的钴电池和镍电池相比，锂铁磷电池的充电速度更快，并且可以频繁充电；这种电池也更便宜、更坚固，而且所需矿物质更容易获取。显然，拜登的气候法正是为这样的情形设计的。共和党人也不看好这种伙伴关系。

But for all the overheated rhetoric, the truth is that free-flowing, in-person collaboration has been the fundamental mode of how technology moves across borders. With few exceptions, you either let yourself learn from your competitors, or you fail to compete with them at all.Competing with China is a good idea. Being so suspicious of it that you trip over your own feet isn’t.
但是，即便言辞很激烈，事实是，自由交流的面对面协作一直是技术跨境流动的基本模式。除了极少数例外，你要么向竞争对手学习，要么根本无法与他们竞争。与中国竞争是个好主意。对中国充满疑虑，以至于自己被自己绊倒，就不是好主意了。

It is not hyperbole to say that the extent of global warming depends on decisions made by China and the United States.Mr. Kerry appeared buoyed that the world’s two biggest polluters had restarted discussions.scientists say industrialized countries need to make deep and sharp cuts in carbon emissions now to stave off the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.
毫不夸张地说，全球变暖的程度取决于中国和美国的决策。克里仍对世界上最大的两个污染国重启谈判感到鼓舞。科学家表示，工业化国家现在就需要大幅削减碳排放，以避免气候变化带来的最灾难性影响。

The pathway and means for reaching this goal, and the tempo and intensity, should be and must be determined by ourselves, and never under the sway of others.If anything is dictating it is the science,All of us should be informed by and compelled by the level of science.Climate should be free standing, because it is a universal threat to everybody on the planet.It’s important not to overstate the current moment in the U.S.-China relationship,It is not détente. It’s far from it.
达到这一目标的路径和方式、节奏和力度则应该而且必须由我们自己作主，决不受他人左右。如果有什么是决定性的，那就是科学，我们所有人都应该受到科学杠杆的影响和驱使。气候变化应该是个独立的问题，因为它是地球上所有人共同面临的威胁。重要的是，不要夸大美中关系的现状，关系没有缓和。 与缓和还差得很远。

China is also on track to meet its near-term goals, despite a significant recent uptick in the construction of coal-fired power plants.Analysts have said the United States has put itself within striking distance of meeting its 2030 goal with new laws and regulations. Those include $370 billion in clean energy investments through the Inflation Reduction Act, which Mr. Biden signed last year, and pending restrictions on emissions from automobile tailpipes and electricity generation.
虽然近来火电厂建设大幅增加，但中国也有望实现其近期目标。分析人士表示，美国新出台的法律法规让其距离实现2030年的目标近在咫尺。这包括拜登去年签署的《减少通货膨胀法案》中的3700亿美元清洁能源投资，以及即将出台的对汽车尾气排放和发电排放的限制。
