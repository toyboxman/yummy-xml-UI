People who know Mr. Pan, who turned 60 earlier this month, describe him as a workaholic who is meticulously detail oriented. He is known to mark up memos from subordinates to correct their grammar.He grew up in Anqing, a flood-prone town on the Yangtze River in central China’s Anhui Province. 
本月早些时候，潘功胜刚过完60岁生日。认识他的人说他是个工作狂，对细节一丝不苟。很多人都知道，他经常批改下属的报告，纠正他们的语法。他在安庆长大，那是中国安徽省长江边一个易受洪水侵袭的小城。

Together, we perhaps could shed our reliance on bigger powers like the United States and China and enjoy a peace dividend as a single economy that beats its swords into plowshares.But there is also the challenge of reconciling vast differences in culture, ideology and political structures, the potentially high economic costs that the South could bear and the need to focus on bread-and-butter issues on our side of the border.
携手合作，我们或许可以摆脱对美国和中国等大国的依赖，成为一个单一经济体，铸剑为犁，享受和平红利。但在文化、意识形态和政治结构上的巨大差异，韩国可能承受的高昂经济成本，以及专注我们这边民生问题的必要性，都是我们这边在面对的挑战。

In spite of all of Taiwan’s progress, our society remains patriarchal and hierarchical. Under Confucian values, women obey their fathers and their brothers and eventually their husbands. People are expected to respect and yield to their elders and superiors — in short, the powers that be.
尽管台湾取得了无数进步，但我们仍然是父权制和等级制社会。在儒家价值观下，女性屈从于父兄，最终屈从于夫。人们应该尊重并服从长辈和上级——简而言之，就是当权者。

The premise of “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s biopic, is straightforward: tell the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist known as the “father of the atomic bomb.” But, as with the director’s other movies, the execution is far from simple. The film skips between time periods, and it features a dizzying array of scientists, politicians and possible Communist agents amid a series of government hearings.
克里斯托弗·诺兰的传记片《奥本海默》的基本设定很简单：讲述被誉为“原子弹之父”的物理学家J·罗伯特·奥本海默的故事。但是，与这位导演的其他电影一样，该片的呈现过程绝非简单。这部电影在不同的时代之间跳跃，在一连串政府听证会中出现了一系列令人眼花缭乱的科学家、政治人士和疑似共产党特工。

Having fallen in love with New Mexico when he was sent there as a boy to recover from dysentery, he established a secret lab in the desert of Los Alamos, N.M., coordinating efforts by top physicists and engineers that culminated in the first nuclear explosion, at Alamogordo on July 16, 1945, known as the Trinity test.
他曾在儿时被送往新墨西哥州治疗痢疾，并且十分喜欢那里。他在新墨西哥州洛斯阿拉莫斯的沙漠中建立了一个秘密实验室，协调众多顶尖物理学家和工程师的工作，最终于1945年7月16日在阿拉莫戈多成功进行了第一次核爆炸，那次试验被称为“三位一体试验”。

He earned a doctorate in physics from Yale and became a professor of physics at U.C. Berkeley, where he invented the cyclotron, a particle accelerator that was instrumental to the development of the atomic bomb. It was Lawrence who helped introduce Oppenheimer to the Manhattan Project. After the war, he advocated for the development of hydrogen nuclear weapons.
他在耶鲁大学获得物理学博士学位，并成为加州大学伯克利分校的物理学教授。他在伯克利发明了回旋加速器，这是一种粒子加速器，对原子弹的研制发挥了重要作用。劳伦斯将奥本海默引荐给曼哈顿计划。战后，他主张发展氢核武器。

In December 2022, a few days after a trailer for “Oppenheimer” was released, Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm nullified the 1954 decision to revoke Oppenheimer’s clearance. She cited a “flawed process” that violated the Atomic Energy Commission’s own regulations.More evidence has come to light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr. Oppenheimer was subjected to,while the evidence of his loyalty and love of country have only been further affirmed.
2022年12月，在《奥本海默》的预告片发布几天后，能源部长詹妮弗·格兰霍姆宣布1954年撤销奥本海默权限的决定无效。她声称那是一个“有缺陷的程序”，违反了原子能委员会自己的规定。更多证据表明，奥本海默博士在审判过程中受到了偏见和不公平的对待，而他对国家的忠诚和热爱的证据得到了进一步的肯定。

Sun, moon, grizzly, black, spectacled, sloth: Bears all over the world can stand, shuffle, totter and walk on two legs, though they usually prefer four.The confusion appeared to begin in late July, when a video surfaced on the Chinese social media site Weibo of a sun bear named Angela standing on a rock in its zoo enclosure, with ramrod posture on its hind legs.
“太阳熊”、“月亮熊”、灰熊、黑熊、“眼镜熊”、懒熊：世界各地的熊都可以站立、拖着脚、摇摇晃晃和用两条腿走路，尽管它们通常更喜欢四肢着地。疑惑似乎始于7月底，当时中国的社交媒体网站微博上出现了一段视频，视频中一只名叫安吉拉的马来熊（即太阳熊）站在动物园围栏的一块岩石上，后腿笔直。

The claim has some precedent: In 2013, a zoo in Henan Province was accused of replacing its lion with a Tibetan mastiff.Other Weibo users had a more exotic explanation: They said the zoo had stuck a human in a bear suit, with the posture, loose skin and fur giving it away.Experts say sun bears have loose skin that helps them wriggle away from predators.
这种指责并非毫无根据：2013年，河南省的一家动物园被指责用藏獒冒充狮子。另一些微博用户则提出了更奇特的解释：他们认为动物园派出了一个穿着熊套装的人，从姿势和松弛的毛皮就可以看出这一点。专家表示，马来熊的皮肤松弛，有助于它们扭动身体躲避捕食者。

The indictment of former President Donald J. Trump on charges of conspiring to overthrow the 2020 election ensures that a federal jury will determine whether he is held accountable for his elaborate, drawn-out and unprecedented attempt to negate a vote of the American people and cling to power.The prevailing Republican view is that the charges against Mr. Trump are a political vendetta.
前总统特朗普被起诉串谋推翻2020年大选结果，这确保了将由联邦陪审团决定他是否要为自己的行为负责——为使美国人民的投票无效，从而继续掌权，特朗普2020年大选后的行动可谓精心策划、年深日久、前所未有。共和党人的普遍看法是，对特朗普的指控是政治迫害。

That dynamic has transformed the stakes of this election in ways that may not always be clear. Behind the debates over inflation, “wokeness” and the border, the 2024 election is at its core about the fundamental tenets of American democracy: the peaceful transfer of power, the independence of the nation’s justice system, the meaning of political free speech and the principle that no one is above the law.
这种态势以一种可能并不总是清晰的方式改变了这次大选的利害关系。在对通货膨胀、“觉醒”、边境等问题的争论背后，2024年大选的核心问题将是美国民主的基本原则：权力的和平移交、国家司法系统的独立、政治言论自由，以及任何人都不能凌驾于法律之上的原则。

Even those who were fence sitting or window shopping, many of them are of the belief that the justice system under President Biden is simply out to get the former president.It has only strengthened his support in Iowa, to the point at which his floor is much more solid than what it was earlier this spring.
即使在保持中立或仍在观望的人中，也有许多人认为，拜登总统手下的司法部门只想加害这名前总统。这只会加强他在艾奥瓦州的支持率，让他的支持率与今年春天早些时候相比变得更加稳固

Whether Republicans continue to stand by Mr. Trump, as they have for months, remains to be seen in the wake of Tuesday’s indictment.At a certain point, are you really going to hitch your whole party to a guy who is just trying to stay out of jail?We have to be brutally honest: Donald Trump sucks all the oxygen out of the room
周二的起诉书公布后，共和党人是否会像他们几个月来那样继续支持特朗普，仍有待观察。到了一个时间点，人们会问，真要让整个政党被一个只是不想坐牢的人绑架吗？我们不得不说句残忍的实话：特朗普吸引了所有的关注

“Stop using weak language.” If you’re a woman, you’ve probably gotten this advice from a mentor, a coach or a teacher. If you want to be heard, use more forceful language. If you want a raise or a promotion, demand it. As the saying goes, nice girls don’t get the corner office.
“不要再使用弱势的语言了。”如果你是女性，你可能从导师、教练或老师那里得到过这个建议。如果你想让别人听到你，就要使用更有力的表达。如果你想要加薪或升职，就提出要求。俗话说，克己复礼的女孩难获擢升。

For months, Mr. Pence has maintained that “history will hold Donald Trump accountable” for his actions on Jan. 6. But he has avoided saying whether the justice system should.If this distinction is a master class in political needle-threading, perhaps no politician has had a narrower needle to thread than Mr. Pence.He spent more than four years as Mr. Trump’s running mate and vice president, a period in which he was so loyal that a prominent vice-presidential historian called him the “sycophant in chief.”
数月以来，彭斯一直在说“历史会对特朗普在1月6日的行为追责”。但对于司法系统是否应该对特朗普追责，彭斯选择回避。如果说这种差异做法是大师级别的走钢丝，那彭斯面临的钢丝难度恐怕比任何政客都要高。他做特朗普的竞选伙伴和副总统有四年多时间，一直非常忠诚，以至于一位知名副总统历史学家称他为“首席马屁精”。

And his signature project for over a decade has been bringing to heel the once extravagantly corrupt military leadership. he has likened himself to a physician.“What starts as decadence will slide toward destruction,” he said, citing an ancient Chinese aphorism.
在十多年的反腐运动中，他的标志性项目一直是迫使曾经极度腐败的军队领导层服从纪律。一直把反腐比作治病.“奢靡之始，危亡之渐，”他引用一条中国古训说。

Crumpled chunks of steel siding, a white dressing table and a steeply leaning wood shed were strewn across the field near Mr. Yu, showing the force with which floodwaters had surged through the area.A gray minivan towing two red inflatable motorboats waited nearby to enter the neighborhood.The flooding wreaked havoc elsewhere in Zhuozhou: a book publisher lost more than $3.5 million worth of books in a single hour; some animal shelters were inundated.
余先生附近的田野上可看到被压皱的大块钢制壁板、一个白色梳妆台，以及一个严重倾斜的木棚，显示了洪水冲过该地区时的力量。一辆拖着两艘红色充气摩托艇的灰色小型货车在附近等待进入该居民区。洪水还给涿州造成了其他严重损失：一家图书出版商在一小时内损失了2000万元码洋的图书；几家动物收容所被淹没。

I’ve seen a lot of children full of vulgar slang and swear words, showing disrespectful gestures to others every day,They may not even know what it means! They just copy the trend from the internet.
我见过好多小孩满嘴烂梗满嘴脏话，天天对着别人电摇的，他们可能都不知道是什么意思，就是从网上看来了然后跟风

Some social media comments have disparaged “Barbie” as inciting conflict between the sexes, and moviegoers have shared stories of men walking out of theaters. (In the United States, conservatives have similarly railed against the movie.)While many of China’s top movies in recent years have been chest-thumping war or action movies, a few female-directed movies, about themes like complicated family relationships, have also drawn huge audiences.Opponents of feminism in China have tarred the movement as pitching women above men.
一些社交媒体评论贬低《芭比》煽动性别冲突，有观众分享了男性中途退场的故事。（在美国，保守派也对这部电影提出了类似的批评。）虽然近年来中国的许多卖座电影都是夸夸其谈的战争片或动作片，但一些由女性导演、以复杂的家庭关系为主题的电影也吸引了大量观众。在中国，反对女权主义的人士指责该片是在让女性凌驾于男性之上。

These writers experimented with subjects that were quotidian but taboo on the page — corruption, sexual desire and evolving gender roles — often wielding confession to upend convention.
这些作家会尝试创作一些司空见惯但在纸上却是禁忌的题材，如腐败、性欲和多变的性别身份，他们经常以反省的方式来挑战传统的叙事。

He told me the story behind his favorite Chinese phrase: huangliang yimeng, or “a fleeting dream as the golden millet cooks.” It refers to a story in which a young man falls asleep at an inn as the innkeeper steams a pot of millet. In his dream, the man marries a beautiful woman from a wealthy family, rises to power in court politics and narrowly escapes death after jealous rivals set him up. After a lifetime, he wakes up. The millet isn’t done yet. Which is the reality: eventless destitution or surreal splendor punctuated by viciousness?
他给我讲了他最喜欢的成语“黄粱一梦”背后的故事。一个小伙子在客栈老板煮着黄米饭的时候睡着了。在梦中他娶了家境优渥的美丽女子，在朝廷里当了大官，然后又被心怀嫉妒的政敌陷害，侥幸保住了性命。一辈子过完后，他醒了过来。米饭还没有煮熟。现实到底是什么：是平淡无奇的困顿人生，还是被邪恶打断的烈火烹油？

It’s a bit of an understatement. Initial efforts to court TSMC and bring its production facilities to the United States led to the creation of the CHIPS and Science Act, a program to expand the U.S. semiconductor industry.As the United States has sought to hinder China’s advances in semiconductor technology, TSMC has been caught in the middle.
这有点轻描淡写了。最初，美国努力争取台积电赴美设厂，制定了《芯片和科学法案》，这是一个旨在扩大美国半导体产业的计划. 随着美国试图阻碍中国在半导体技术方面的进步，台积电左右为难。

Several Republicans criticized the president’s order as too little, too late and “riddled with loopholes,” as Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, put it.Politicians increasingly regard corporate investments in China as a form of collusion with a foreign enemy, even when there is no allegation of illegality
一些共和党人批评总统的命令太轻、来得太晚，而且，正如佛罗里达州共和党参议员、参议院情报委员会副主席马可·卢比奥所说，“漏洞百出”。政客们越来越多地将企业在中国的投资视为一种与外敌勾结的形式，即使不存在违法行为的指控。

However, I was careful to acknowledge that China’s three-decade economic miracle has made it a bona fide economic superpower and that its current problems aren’t likely to change that fact.A few weeks ago I ragged on The Wall Street Journal for a deeply misleading dollar comparison between the United States and the euro
但我也谨慎地承认，30年的经济奇迹已经把中国变成了一个真正的经济超级大国，它当前面临的问题不太可能改变这个事实。几周前，我嘲笑了《华尔街日报》对美国和欧元区以美元计算的经济规模的比较，批评其极具误导性。

A man spends decades working a monotonous factory job. His wife grows increasingly insecure about the future. Their son is withdrawn, seemingly struggling at school. Then a building collapses, and their world comes crashing down. 
一个男人在工厂里做了几十年单调乏味的工作。他的妻子对未来越来越没有安全感。他们的儿子性格孤僻，在学校似乎举步维艰。然后，一座大厦倒塌了，他们的世界也随之崩塌。

The band, Omnipotent Youth Society, is from Shijiazhuang. Ji Geng, the band’s lyricist and bass player, has said the song is about the “the erosion of enthusiasm and self-esteem” in one family. The singer’s plaintive vocals, set at first against a simple backdrop of harmonica and strings, build to a soaring guitar solo.The revamped song largely keeps the musical structure. But its lyrics couldn’t be more different.
这个乐队名叫“万能青年旅店”，来自石家庄。乐队的作词人和贝斯手姬赓表示，这首歌是关于一个家庭中“热情和自尊的蚕食”。口琴和弦乐的简单背景衬托着歌手悲伤的歌声，随后逐渐变成高亢的吉他独奏。改编后的歌曲在很大程度上保留了音乐结构。但歌词却截然不同。

In the original, the story of the family continues, shifting to the couple’s teenage son. He seems standoffish, and like his mother, pessimistic about the future. The new song flips the sentiment of moody adolescence entirely, instead exalting a city working hard and “living up to its prime years.”Out With Uncertainty, in With Confidence
在原作中，这个家庭的故事还在继续，转到这对夫妇十几岁的儿子身上。他看起来很冷漠，像他的母亲一样，对未来感到悲观。改编之作完全颠覆了喜怒无常的青春期情绪，而是颂扬一座努力前行的城市，“不负韶华”。去掉不安，加上自信

For many people, it’s through food, one of the things the island is known for, aside from its semiconductor industry. In the past decade or so, restaurateurs, writers and scholars have started to promote the concept of Taiwanese cuisine, reviving traditional fine dining and incorporating local, especially Indigenous, produce and ingredients into cooking.
对很多人来说，除了半导体产业，美食是这个岛屿最出名的东西之一。在过去十年左右的时间里，餐馆老板、作家和学者开始推广台湾美食的概念，复兴传统美食，并将当地、尤其是原住民的农产品和食材融入烹饪中。

Historical grievances between America’s two closest Asian allies, Japan and South Korea, have loomed as a potential Achilles’ heel for U.S. security interests in the region for far too long. Lingering Korean resentment over the legacy of Japan’s colonial occupation and Tokyo’s perceived reluctance to own up to that past have undermined American attempts to present a united allied front in the Pacific.This is no longer tenable.
长期以来，作为美国最亲密的亚洲盟友，日本和韩国之间的历史恩怨是美国在该地区安全利益的潜在致命弱点。韩国人对日本殖民统治遗留问题的怨恨挥之不去，而东京又被认为显然不愿承认这段历史，这些都削弱了美国在太平洋地区建立盟国统一阵线的努力。这样的局面如今已经很难维系。

This will mean dispelling concerns over getting dragged into someone else’s fight.Some Japanese worry that escalating friction between Washington and Beijing over Taiwan could lead to a Chinese attack on bases in Japan. Differences like these play into the hands of China and North Korea.
这将意味着要打消被拖入他国战斗的忧虑。一些日本人担心，华盛顿和北京之间在台湾问题上不断升级的摩擦可能导致中国攻击日本的军事基地。诸如此类的分歧正中中国和朝鲜下怀。

The Chinese economy is faced with an imminent downward spiral with the worst yet to come,The central bank, analysts at Barclays said on Tuesday, would soon lower the amount of reserves banks need to hold, in a bid to stimulate the economy.The real estate sector remains a big drag on the economic recovery
中国经济面临着迫在眉睫的螺旋式下滑，最糟糕的情况尚未到来，巴克莱分析师周二表示，为了刺激经济，中国央行很快将降低银行存在央行的储备金额。房地产行业仍是经济复苏的一大拖累。

More than three years into the pandemic and untold millions of people dead, that question about the Covid-19 coronavirus remains controversial and fraught, with facts sparkling amid a tangle of analyses and hypotheticals like Christmas lights strung on a dark, thorny tree.Some contrarians say that it doesn’t matter, the source of the virus. 
经过了三年多的疫情和数百万人死亡后，关于新冠病毒的起源仍众说纷纭、充满争议，一大堆分析和假说使用的事实，如同挂在有刺的黑暗树枝上的圣诞彩灯。一些持反主流观点的人说，病毒的起源不重要。

To test that hypothesis, you would want samples of blood, feces or mucus taken from the raccoon dogs, porcupines and other wildlife that languished, caged and doomed, in the market. You would screen those samples for signs of the virus. If you found the virus itself, or at least sizable bits of its genome, you would then make a comparative analysis of genomes, including some from the earliest human cases, to deduce whether people got the virus from the wildlife or vice versa.
为了验证这个假设，需要从市场上的貉、豪猪，以及其他关在笼子里奄奄一息、气数将尽的野生动物身上采集血液、粪便或粘液样本。对这些样本进行筛查，寻找病毒的踪迹。如果发现了病毒本身，或者至少找到了病毒相当大的基因组片段，就可以对基因组、包括与一些来自最早的人类病例的基因组进行比较分析，以推断人类是从野生动物身上感染病毒的，还是反之。

Bloom said, “I think what you have is a lot of people strongly defaulting to their prior beliefs.” Scientists who study zoonotic diseases (those that spill over from nonhuman animals into people) might be inclined to assume a natural origin. Scientists who have long argued against the risks of “gain of function” research (experimental work exploring the evolutionary capacities of potentially dangerous pathogens) might readily assume a lab leak. National security experts with strong views of the oppressive, secretive Chinese government might lean toward scenarios involving Chinese malfeasance and cover-up.
布鲁姆说：“我认为很多人都坚定默认了他们的先验信念。”研究人畜共患疾病（从非人类动物传染给人类的疾病）的科学家可能倾向于自然起源假设。而长期以来一直反对“功能获得”研究（探索潜在危险病原体进化能力的实验工作）风险的科学家可能很容易假设实验室泄漏。对高压、隐秘的中国政府抱有强烈看法的国家安全专家可能会倾向于中国有不法行为和掩盖事实的情况。

If the dollar gets too strong while the global economy is on a weaker foot, the U.S. won’t be immune to the backdraft.Mr. Goncalves warned that the full effect of the Fed’s interest rate increases to date, rising from near zero last year to above 5 percent, have yet to flow through the economy, and that could mean there are more weaknesses to come.“August is often a perplexing month in the market,” Mr. Goncalves said. “It’s not quite crisis mode, but something is up.”
如果美元在全球经济疲软的情况下变得过于强势，美国将无法在逆流中幸免。贡萨尔维斯警告称，迄今为止，美联储的加息举措将去年接近零的利率升至5%以上，其全部影响尚未体现在经济中，这可能意味着未来还会出现更多疲软。“在股市里，8月通常是令人困惑的月份，”贡萨尔维斯说。“危机模式还不至于，不过是有些不妙。”

For most of his 57 years on the island of Sulawesi, Jamal was accustomed to scarcity, modest expectations and a grim shortage of jobs. People mined sand, caught fish and coaxed crops from the soil. Chickens frequently disappeared from front yards, stolen by hungry neighbors.six years ago, a towering smelter rose next to his home. Inside Mr. Jamal’s home, a new air-conditioner eases the muggy tropical air. Formerly bare concrete floors now glisten with ceramic tiles.
贾马尔在苏拉威西岛生活了57年，大部分时间里，他已经习惯了物资匮乏、低期望值和极端稀少的就业机会。人们挖沙子、捕鱼、耕种庄稼。前院的鸡经常失踪，被饥饿的邻居偷走。六年前，他家附近建起了一座高耸的冶炼厂。在贾马尔家里，一台新空调缓解了闷热的热带空气。昔日光秃秃的水泥地板现在铺上了闪闪发光的瓷砖。

Here is the crux of the deal that Indonesian officials have cut with deep-pocketed Chinese companies now dominating the nickel industry: pollution and social strife in exchange for upward mobility.At the heart of the trade-off are Indonesia’s unrivaled stocks of nickel.
这就是印尼官员与目前在镍产业中占主导地位、财力雄厚的中国公司达成交易的关键：以污染和社会冲突换取向上流动的空间。交易的核心是印尼无与伦比的镍存量。

Much of the nickel was headed north to the Morowali Industrial Park, an empire of 50 factories sprawling across nearly 10,000 acres that operates like a gated city, complete with a private airport, a dedicated seaport and a central kitchen that churns out 70,000 meals a day.
大部分的镍被运往北部的莫罗瓦利工业园，那是一个由50家工厂组成的帝国，占地近4000公顷，运作起来就像一座封闭的城市，拥有一个私人机场、一个专用海港和一个每天能做7万份伙食的中央厨房。

Wang Lidan stood vigil over a charcoal grill in front of her shop, fanning skewers of squid while hawking her other wares — scallion pancakes, fried dumplings, ice cream bars and jars of pickled radishes.
王丽丹（音）站在店门口的木炭烤架后面，一边扇动着鱿鱼串，一边兜售其他商品——葱花煎饼、煎饺、雪糕和罐装腌萝卜。

The policy change was a sharp comedown for an exuberant housing market that for decades ran parallel to China’s rise as a global economic power, but was marred by overbuilding and risky financial practices.China’s property sector has experienced an unprecedented correction
几十年来，伴随着中国崛起为全球经济强国，房地产市场一片繁荣，但过度建设和高风险的金融行为造成了损害。政策变化使繁荣的房地产市场急剧衰落。中国房地产行业经历了前所未有的调整。

Only three hours before she found herself huddled in the Pacific Ocean, a barrage of embers and ash hurtling above her, Chelsea Denton Fuqua was lounging in bed with a fan, a pristine blue sky outside the window of her home that lies half a mile from the Lahaina waterfront on the Hawaiian island of Maui.It was moments later when she caught a glimpse of smoke in the distance. At first it was a wisp, but within minutes it had grown thicker, rippling down the hillside on violent winds.
切尔西·丹顿·福卡把身体蜷缩在太平洋里，头顶上飞舞着大量的灰烬。而三个小时前，她还吹着风扇，懒洋洋地躺在床上，她的家在夏威夷的毛伊岛上，距离拉海纳海边数百米，窗外是一片纯净的蓝天。只过了片刻，她就瞥见远处有烟雾。 起初只是一缕，但几分钟之内就变得越来越浓重，随着狂风沿山坡蔓延开来。

In China, August has been a dizzying ride.But now China is struggling to regain its footing after emerging from the paralyzing pandemic lockdowns its leaders imposed, and many of its economic problems are pointing back to real estate.
在中国，这个8月事件频出，令人眼花缭乱。中国正在艰难地试图重新站稳脚跟，许多经济问题又回到了房地产的问题上。
