People who know Mr. Pan, who turned 60 earlier this month, describe him as a workaholic who is meticulously detail oriented. He is known to mark up memos from subordinates to correct their grammar.He grew up in Anqing, a flood-prone town on the Yangtze River in central China’s Anhui Province. 
本月早些时候，潘功胜刚过完60岁生日。认识他的人说他是个工作狂，对细节一丝不苟。很多人都知道，他经常批改下属的报告，纠正他们的语法。他在安庆长大，那是中国安徽省长江边一个易受洪水侵袭的小城。

Together, we perhaps could shed our reliance on bigger powers like the United States and China and enjoy a peace dividend as a single economy that beats its swords into plowshares.But there is also the challenge of reconciling vast differences in culture, ideology and political structures, the potentially high economic costs that the South could bear and the need to focus on bread-and-butter issues on our side of the border.
携手合作，我们或许可以摆脱对美国和中国等大国的依赖，成为一个单一经济体，铸剑为犁，享受和平红利。但在文化、意识形态和政治结构上的巨大差异，韩国可能承受的高昂经济成本，以及专注我们这边民生问题的必要性，都是我们这边在面对的挑战。

In spite of all of Taiwan’s progress, our society remains patriarchal and hierarchical. Under Confucian values, women obey their fathers and their brothers and eventually their husbands. People are expected to respect and yield to their elders and superiors — in short, the powers that be.
尽管台湾取得了无数进步，但我们仍然是父权制和等级制社会。在儒家价值观下，女性屈从于父兄，最终屈从于夫。人们应该尊重并服从长辈和上级——简而言之，就是当权者。

The premise of “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s biopic, is straightforward: tell the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist known as the “father of the atomic bomb.” But, as with the director’s other movies, the execution is far from simple. The film skips between time periods, and it features a dizzying array of scientists, politicians and possible Communist agents amid a series of government hearings.
克里斯托弗·诺兰的传记片《奥本海默》的基本设定很简单：讲述被誉为“原子弹之父”的物理学家J·罗伯特·奥本海默的故事。但是，与这位导演的其他电影一样，该片的呈现过程绝非简单。这部电影在不同的时代之间跳跃，在一连串政府听证会中出现了一系列令人眼花缭乱的科学家、政治人士和疑似共产党特工。

Having fallen in love with New Mexico when he was sent there as a boy to recover from dysentery, he established a secret lab in the desert of Los Alamos, N.M., coordinating efforts by top physicists and engineers that culminated in the first nuclear explosion, at Alamogordo on July 16, 1945, known as the Trinity test.
他曾在儿时被送往新墨西哥州治疗痢疾，并且十分喜欢那里。他在新墨西哥州洛斯阿拉莫斯的沙漠中建立了一个秘密实验室，协调众多顶尖物理学家和工程师的工作，最终于1945年7月16日在阿拉莫戈多成功进行了第一次核爆炸，那次试验被称为“三位一体试验”。

He earned a doctorate in physics from Yale and became a professor of physics at U.C. Berkeley, where he invented the cyclotron, a particle accelerator that was instrumental to the development of the atomic bomb. It was Lawrence who helped introduce Oppenheimer to the Manhattan Project. After the war, he advocated for the development of hydrogen nuclear weapons.
他在耶鲁大学获得物理学博士学位，并成为加州大学伯克利分校的物理学教授。他在伯克利发明了回旋加速器，这是一种粒子加速器，对原子弹的研制发挥了重要作用。劳伦斯将奥本海默引荐给曼哈顿计划。战后，他主张发展氢核武器。

In December 2022, a few days after a trailer for “Oppenheimer” was released, Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm nullified the 1954 decision to revoke Oppenheimer’s clearance. She cited a “flawed process” that violated the Atomic Energy Commission’s own regulations.More evidence has come to light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr. Oppenheimer was subjected to,while the evidence of his loyalty and love of country have only been further affirmed.
2022年12月，在《奥本海默》的预告片发布几天后，能源部长詹妮弗·格兰霍姆宣布1954年撤销奥本海默权限的决定无效。她声称那是一个“有缺陷的程序”，违反了原子能委员会自己的规定。更多证据表明，奥本海默博士在审判过程中受到了偏见和不公平的对待，而他对国家的忠诚和热爱的证据得到了进一步的肯定。

Sun, moon, grizzly, black, spectacled, sloth: Bears all over the world can stand, shuffle, totter and walk on two legs, though they usually prefer four.The confusion appeared to begin in late July, when a video surfaced on the Chinese social media site Weibo of a sun bear named Angela standing on a rock in its zoo enclosure, with ramrod posture on its hind legs.
“太阳熊”、“月亮熊”、灰熊、黑熊、“眼镜熊”、懒熊：世界各地的熊都可以站立、拖着脚、摇摇晃晃和用两条腿走路，尽管它们通常更喜欢四肢着地。疑惑似乎始于7月底，当时中国的社交媒体网站微博上出现了一段视频，视频中一只名叫安吉拉的马来熊（即太阳熊）站在动物园围栏的一块岩石上，后腿笔直。

The claim has some precedent: In 2013, a zoo in Henan Province was accused of replacing its lion with a Tibetan mastiff.Other Weibo users had a more exotic explanation: They said the zoo had stuck a human in a bear suit, with the posture, loose skin and fur giving it away.Experts say sun bears have loose skin that helps them wriggle away from predators.
这种指责并非毫无根据：2013年，河南省的一家动物园被指责用藏獒冒充狮子。另一些微博用户则提出了更奇特的解释：他们认为动物园派出了一个穿着熊套装的人，从姿势和松弛的毛皮就可以看出这一点。专家表示，马来熊的皮肤松弛，有助于它们扭动身体躲避捕食者。

The indictment of former President Donald J. Trump on charges of conspiring to overthrow the 2020 election ensures that a federal jury will determine whether he is held accountable for his elaborate, drawn-out and unprecedented attempt to negate a vote of the American people and cling to power.The prevailing Republican view is that the charges against Mr. Trump are a political vendetta.
前总统特朗普被起诉串谋推翻2020年大选结果，这确保了将由联邦陪审团决定他是否要为自己的行为负责——为使美国人民的投票无效，从而继续掌权，特朗普2020年大选后的行动可谓精心策划、年深日久、前所未有。共和党人的普遍看法是，对特朗普的指控是政治迫害。

That dynamic has transformed the stakes of this election in ways that may not always be clear. Behind the debates over inflation, “wokeness” and the border, the 2024 election is at its core about the fundamental tenets of American democracy: the peaceful transfer of power, the independence of the nation’s justice system, the meaning of political free speech and the principle that no one is above the law.
这种态势以一种可能并不总是清晰的方式改变了这次大选的利害关系。在对通货膨胀、“觉醒”、边境等问题的争论背后，2024年大选的核心问题将是美国民主的基本原则：权力的和平移交、国家司法系统的独立、政治言论自由，以及任何人都不能凌驾于法律之上的原则。

Even those who were fence sitting or window shopping, many of them are of the belief that the justice system under President Biden is simply out to get the former president.It has only strengthened his support in Iowa, to the point at which his floor is much more solid than what it was earlier this spring.
即使在保持中立或仍在观望的人中，也有许多人认为，拜登总统手下的司法部门只想加害这名前总统。这只会加强他在艾奥瓦州的支持率，让他的支持率与今年春天早些时候相比变得更加稳固

Whether Republicans continue to stand by Mr. Trump, as they have for months, remains to be seen in the wake of Tuesday’s indictment.At a certain point, are you really going to hitch your whole party to a guy who is just trying to stay out of jail?We have to be brutally honest: Donald Trump sucks all the oxygen out of the room
周二的起诉书公布后，共和党人是否会像他们几个月来那样继续支持特朗普，仍有待观察。到了一个时间点，人们会问，真要让整个政党被一个只是不想坐牢的人绑架吗？我们不得不说句残忍的实话：特朗普吸引了所有的关注

“Stop using weak language.” If you’re a woman, you’ve probably gotten this advice from a mentor, a coach or a teacher. If you want to be heard, use more forceful language. If you want a raise or a promotion, demand it. As the saying goes, nice girls don’t get the corner office.
“不要再使用弱势的语言了。”如果你是女性，你可能从导师、教练或老师那里得到过这个建议。如果你想让别人听到你，就要使用更有力的表达。如果你想要加薪或升职，就提出要求。俗话说，克己复礼的女孩难获擢升。

For months, Mr. Pence has maintained that “history will hold Donald Trump accountable” for his actions on Jan. 6. But he has avoided saying whether the justice system should.If this distinction is a master class in political needle-threading, perhaps no politician has had a narrower needle to thread than Mr. Pence.He spent more than four years as Mr. Trump’s running mate and vice president, a period in which he was so loyal that a prominent vice-presidential historian called him the “sycophant in chief.”
数月以来，彭斯一直在说“历史会对特朗普在1月6日的行为追责”。但对于司法系统是否应该对特朗普追责，彭斯选择回避。如果说这种差异做法是大师级别的走钢丝，那彭斯面临的钢丝难度恐怕比任何政客都要高。他做特朗普的竞选伙伴和副总统有四年多时间，一直非常忠诚，以至于一位知名副总统历史学家称他为“首席马屁精”。

And his signature project for over a decade has been bringing to heel the once extravagantly corrupt military leadership. he has likened himself to a physician.“What starts as decadence will slide toward destruction,” he said, citing an ancient Chinese aphorism.
在十多年的反腐运动中，他的标志性项目一直是迫使曾经极度腐败的军队领导层服从纪律。一直把反腐比作治病.“奢靡之始，危亡之渐，”他引用一条中国古训说。

Crumpled chunks of steel siding, a white dressing table and a steeply leaning wood shed were strewn across the field near Mr. Yu, showing the force with which floodwaters had surged through the area.A gray minivan towing two red inflatable motorboats waited nearby to enter the neighborhood.The flooding wreaked havoc elsewhere in Zhuozhou: a book publisher lost more than $3.5 million worth of books in a single hour; some animal shelters were inundated.
余先生附近的田野上可看到被压皱的大块钢制壁板、一个白色梳妆台，以及一个严重倾斜的木棚，显示了洪水冲过该地区时的力量。一辆拖着两艘红色充气摩托艇的灰色小型货车在附近等待进入该居民区。洪水还给涿州造成了其他严重损失：一家图书出版商在一小时内损失了2000万元码洋的图书；几家动物收容所被淹没。

I’ve seen a lot of children full of vulgar slang and swear words, showing disrespectful gestures to others every day,They may not even know what it means! They just copy the trend from the internet.
我见过好多小孩满嘴烂梗满嘴脏话，天天对着别人电摇的，他们可能都不知道是什么意思，就是从网上看来了然后跟风

Some social media comments have disparaged “Barbie” as inciting conflict between the sexes, and moviegoers have shared stories of men walking out of theaters. (In the United States, conservatives have similarly railed against the movie.)While many of China’s top movies in recent years have been chest-thumping war or action movies, a few female-directed movies, about themes like complicated family relationships, have also drawn huge audiences.Opponents of feminism in China have tarred the movement as pitching women above men.
一些社交媒体评论贬低《芭比》煽动性别冲突，有观众分享了男性中途退场的故事。（在美国，保守派也对这部电影提出了类似的批评。）虽然近年来中国的许多卖座电影都是夸夸其谈的战争片或动作片，但一些由女性导演、以复杂的家庭关系为主题的电影也吸引了大量观众。在中国，反对女权主义的人士指责该片是在让女性凌驾于男性之上。

These writers experimented with subjects that were quotidian but taboo on the page — corruption, sexual desire and evolving gender roles — often wielding confession to upend convention.
这些作家会尝试创作一些司空见惯但在纸上却是禁忌的题材，如腐败、性欲和多变的性别身份，他们经常以反省的方式来挑战传统的叙事。

He told me the story behind his favorite Chinese phrase: huangliang yimeng, or “a fleeting dream as the golden millet cooks.” It refers to a story in which a young man falls asleep at an inn as the innkeeper steams a pot of millet. In his dream, the man marries a beautiful woman from a wealthy family, rises to power in court politics and narrowly escapes death after jealous rivals set him up. After a lifetime, he wakes up. The millet isn’t done yet. Which is the reality: eventless destitution or surreal splendor punctuated by viciousness?
他给我讲了他最喜欢的成语“黄粱一梦”背后的故事。一个小伙子在客栈老板煮着黄米饭的时候睡着了。在梦中他娶了家境优渥的美丽女子，在朝廷里当了大官，然后又被心怀嫉妒的政敌陷害，侥幸保住了性命。一辈子过完后，他醒了过来。米饭还没有煮熟。现实到底是什么：是平淡无奇的困顿人生，还是被邪恶打断的烈火烹油？

It’s a bit of an understatement. Initial efforts to court TSMC and bring its production facilities to the United States led to the creation of the CHIPS and Science Act, a program to expand the U.S. semiconductor industry.As the United States has sought to hinder China’s advances in semiconductor technology, TSMC has been caught in the middle.
这有点轻描淡写了。最初，美国努力争取台积电赴美设厂，制定了《芯片和科学法案》，这是一个旨在扩大美国半导体产业的计划. 随着美国试图阻碍中国在半导体技术方面的进步，台积电左右为难。

Several Republicans criticized the president’s order as too little, too late and “riddled with loopholes,” as Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, put it.Politicians increasingly regard corporate investments in China as a form of collusion with a foreign enemy, even when there is no allegation of illegality
一些共和党人批评总统的命令太轻、来得太晚，而且，正如佛罗里达州共和党参议员、参议院情报委员会副主席马可·卢比奥所说，“漏洞百出”。政客们越来越多地将企业在中国的投资视为一种与外敌勾结的形式，即使不存在违法行为的指控。

However, I was careful to acknowledge that China’s three-decade economic miracle has made it a bona fide economic superpower and that its current problems aren’t likely to change that fact.A few weeks ago I ragged on The Wall Street Journal for a deeply misleading dollar comparison between the United States and the euro
但我也谨慎地承认，30年的经济奇迹已经把中国变成了一个真正的经济超级大国，它当前面临的问题不太可能改变这个事实。几周前，我嘲笑了《华尔街日报》对美国和欧元区以美元计算的经济规模的比较，批评其极具误导性。

A man spends decades working a monotonous factory job. His wife grows increasingly insecure about the future. Their son is withdrawn, seemingly struggling at school. Then a building collapses, and their world comes crashing down. 
一个男人在工厂里做了几十年单调乏味的工作。他的妻子对未来越来越没有安全感。他们的儿子性格孤僻，在学校似乎举步维艰。然后，一座大厦倒塌了，他们的世界也随之崩塌。

The band, Omnipotent Youth Society, is from Shijiazhuang. Ji Geng, the band’s lyricist and bass player, has said the song is about the “the erosion of enthusiasm and self-esteem” in one family. The singer’s plaintive vocals, set at first against a simple backdrop of harmonica and strings, build to a soaring guitar solo.The revamped song largely keeps the musical structure. But its lyrics couldn’t be more different.
这个乐队名叫“万能青年旅店”，来自石家庄。乐队的作词人和贝斯手姬赓表示，这首歌是关于一个家庭中“热情和自尊的蚕食”。口琴和弦乐的简单背景衬托着歌手悲伤的歌声，随后逐渐变成高亢的吉他独奏。改编后的歌曲在很大程度上保留了音乐结构。但歌词却截然不同。

In the original, the story of the family continues, shifting to the couple’s teenage son. He seems standoffish, and like his mother, pessimistic about the future. The new song flips the sentiment of moody adolescence entirely, instead exalting a city working hard and “living up to its prime years.”Out With Uncertainty, in With Confidence
在原作中，这个家庭的故事还在继续，转到这对夫妇十几岁的儿子身上。他看起来很冷漠，像他的母亲一样，对未来感到悲观。改编之作完全颠覆了喜怒无常的青春期情绪，而是颂扬一座努力前行的城市，“不负韶华”。去掉不安，加上自信

For many people, it’s through food, one of the things the island is known for, aside from its semiconductor industry. In the past decade or so, restaurateurs, writers and scholars have started to promote the concept of Taiwanese cuisine, reviving traditional fine dining and incorporating local, especially Indigenous, produce and ingredients into cooking.
对很多人来说，除了半导体产业，美食是这个岛屿最出名的东西之一。在过去十年左右的时间里，餐馆老板、作家和学者开始推广台湾美食的概念，复兴传统美食，并将当地、尤其是原住民的农产品和食材融入烹饪中。

Historical grievances between America’s two closest Asian allies, Japan and South Korea, have loomed as a potential Achilles’ heel for U.S. security interests in the region for far too long. Lingering Korean resentment over the legacy of Japan’s colonial occupation and Tokyo’s perceived reluctance to own up to that past have undermined American attempts to present a united allied front in the Pacific.This is no longer tenable.
长期以来，作为美国最亲密的亚洲盟友，日本和韩国之间的历史恩怨是美国在该地区安全利益的潜在致命弱点。韩国人对日本殖民统治遗留问题的怨恨挥之不去，而东京又被认为显然不愿承认这段历史，这些都削弱了美国在太平洋地区建立盟国统一阵线的努力。这样的局面如今已经很难维系。

This will mean dispelling concerns over getting dragged into someone else’s fight.Some Japanese worry that escalating friction between Washington and Beijing over Taiwan could lead to a Chinese attack on bases in Japan. Differences like these play into the hands of China and North Korea.
这将意味着要打消被拖入他国战斗的忧虑。一些日本人担心，华盛顿和北京之间在台湾问题上不断升级的摩擦可能导致中国攻击日本的军事基地。诸如此类的分歧正中中国和朝鲜下怀。

The Chinese economy is faced with an imminent downward spiral with the worst yet to come,The central bank, analysts at Barclays said on Tuesday, would soon lower the amount of reserves banks need to hold, in a bid to stimulate the economy.The real estate sector remains a big drag on the economic recovery
中国经济面临着迫在眉睫的螺旋式下滑，最糟糕的情况尚未到来，巴克莱分析师周二表示，为了刺激经济，中国央行很快将降低银行存在央行的储备金额。房地产行业仍是经济复苏的一大拖累。

More than three years into the pandemic and untold millions of people dead, that question about the Covid-19 coronavirus remains controversial and fraught, with facts sparkling amid a tangle of analyses and hypotheticals like Christmas lights strung on a dark, thorny tree.Some contrarians say that it doesn’t matter, the source of the virus. 
经过了三年多的疫情和数百万人死亡后，关于新冠病毒的起源仍众说纷纭、充满争议，一大堆分析和假说使用的事实，如同挂在有刺的黑暗树枝上的圣诞彩灯。一些持反主流观点的人说，病毒的起源不重要。

To test that hypothesis, you would want samples of blood, feces or mucus taken from the raccoon dogs, porcupines and other wildlife that languished, caged and doomed, in the market. You would screen those samples for signs of the virus. If you found the virus itself, or at least sizable bits of its genome, you would then make a comparative analysis of genomes, including some from the earliest human cases, to deduce whether people got the virus from the wildlife or vice versa.
为了验证这个假设，需要从市场上的貉、豪猪，以及其他关在笼子里奄奄一息、气数将尽的野生动物身上采集血液、粪便或粘液样本。对这些样本进行筛查，寻找病毒的踪迹。如果发现了病毒本身，或者至少找到了病毒相当大的基因组片段，就可以对基因组、包括与一些来自最早的人类病例的基因组进行比较分析，以推断人类是从野生动物身上感染病毒的，还是反之。

Bloom said, “I think what you have is a lot of people strongly defaulting to their prior beliefs.” Scientists who study zoonotic diseases (those that spill over from nonhuman animals into people) might be inclined to assume a natural origin. Scientists who have long argued against the risks of “gain of function” research (experimental work exploring the evolutionary capacities of potentially dangerous pathogens) might readily assume a lab leak. National security experts with strong views of the oppressive, secretive Chinese government might lean toward scenarios involving Chinese malfeasance and cover-up.
布鲁姆说：“我认为很多人都坚定默认了他们的先验信念。”研究人畜共患疾病（从非人类动物传染给人类的疾病）的科学家可能倾向于自然起源假设。而长期以来一直反对“功能获得”研究（探索潜在危险病原体进化能力的实验工作）风险的科学家可能很容易假设实验室泄漏。对高压、隐秘的中国政府抱有强烈看法的国家安全专家可能会倾向于中国有不法行为和掩盖事实的情况。

If the dollar gets too strong while the global economy is on a weaker foot, the U.S. won’t be immune to the backdraft.Mr. Goncalves warned that the full effect of the Fed’s interest rate increases to date, rising from near zero last year to above 5 percent, have yet to flow through the economy, and that could mean there are more weaknesses to come.“August is often a perplexing month in the market,” Mr. Goncalves said. “It’s not quite crisis mode, but something is up.”
如果美元在全球经济疲软的情况下变得过于强势，美国将无法在逆流中幸免。贡萨尔维斯警告称，迄今为止，美联储的加息举措将去年接近零的利率升至5%以上，其全部影响尚未体现在经济中，这可能意味着未来还会出现更多疲软。“在股市里，8月通常是令人困惑的月份，”贡萨尔维斯说。“危机模式还不至于，不过是有些不妙。”

For most of his 57 years on the island of Sulawesi, Jamal was accustomed to scarcity, modest expectations and a grim shortage of jobs. People mined sand, caught fish and coaxed crops from the soil. Chickens frequently disappeared from front yards, stolen by hungry neighbors.six years ago, a towering smelter rose next to his home. Inside Mr. Jamal’s home, a new air-conditioner eases the muggy tropical air. Formerly bare concrete floors now glisten with ceramic tiles.
贾马尔在苏拉威西岛生活了57年，大部分时间里，他已经习惯了物资匮乏、低期望值和极端稀少的就业机会。人们挖沙子、捕鱼、耕种庄稼。前院的鸡经常失踪，被饥饿的邻居偷走。六年前，他家附近建起了一座高耸的冶炼厂。在贾马尔家里，一台新空调缓解了闷热的热带空气。昔日光秃秃的水泥地板现在铺上了闪闪发光的瓷砖。

Here is the crux of the deal that Indonesian officials have cut with deep-pocketed Chinese companies now dominating the nickel industry: pollution and social strife in exchange for upward mobility.At the heart of the trade-off are Indonesia’s unrivaled stocks of nickel.
这就是印尼官员与目前在镍产业中占主导地位、财力雄厚的中国公司达成交易的关键：以污染和社会冲突换取向上流动的空间。交易的核心是印尼无与伦比的镍存量。

Much of the nickel was headed north to the Morowali Industrial Park, an empire of 50 factories sprawling across nearly 10,000 acres that operates like a gated city, complete with a private airport, a dedicated seaport and a central kitchen that churns out 70,000 meals a day.
大部分的镍被运往北部的莫罗瓦利工业园，那是一个由50家工厂组成的帝国，占地近4000公顷，运作起来就像一座封闭的城市，拥有一个私人机场、一个专用海港和一个每天能做7万份伙食的中央厨房。

Wang Lidan stood vigil over a charcoal grill in front of her shop, fanning skewers of squid while hawking her other wares — scallion pancakes, fried dumplings, ice cream bars and jars of pickled radishes.
王丽丹（音）站在店门口的木炭烤架后面，一边扇动着鱿鱼串，一边兜售其他商品——葱花煎饼、煎饺、雪糕和罐装腌萝卜。

The policy change was a sharp comedown for an exuberant housing market that for decades ran parallel to China’s rise as a global economic power, but was marred by overbuilding and risky financial practices.China’s property sector has experienced an unprecedented correction
几十年来，伴随着中国崛起为全球经济强国，房地产市场一片繁荣，但过度建设和高风险的金融行为造成了损害。政策变化使繁荣的房地产市场急剧衰落。中国房地产行业经历了前所未有的调整。

Only three hours before she found herself huddled in the Pacific Ocean, a barrage of embers and ash hurtling above her, Chelsea Denton Fuqua was lounging in bed with a fan, a pristine blue sky outside the window of her home that lies half a mile from the Lahaina waterfront on the Hawaiian island of Maui.It was moments later when she caught a glimpse of smoke in the distance. At first it was a wisp, but within minutes it had grown thicker, rippling down the hillside on violent winds.
切尔西·丹顿·福卡把身体蜷缩在太平洋里，头顶上飞舞着大量的灰烬。而三个小时前，她还吹着风扇，懒洋洋地躺在床上，她的家在夏威夷的毛伊岛上，距离拉海纳海边数百米，窗外是一片纯净的蓝天。只过了片刻，她就瞥见远处有烟雾。 起初只是一缕，但几分钟之内就变得越来越浓重，随着狂风沿山坡蔓延开来。

In China, August has been a dizzying ride.But now China is struggling to regain its footing after emerging from the paralyzing pandemic lockdowns its leaders imposed, and many of its economic problems are pointing back to real estate.
在中国，这个8月事件频出，令人眼花缭乱。中国正在艰难地试图重新站稳脚跟，许多经济问题又回到了房地产的问题上。

Beijing has often warned Tokyo and Seoul not to be drawn into the Taiwan issue, depicting Washington as a puppet master manipulating its allies. In an editorial on Wednesday, the Global Times likened South Korea to a “kindergarten child receiving a sticker from their teacher” by agreeing to attend the summit at Camp David. That excitement, the editorial said, should instead be replaced with “a sense of deep trepidation and caution.”China has also invoked ethnicity to try to drive a wedge between the sides.no matter how yellow you dye your hair, or how sharp you make your nose, you’ll never turn into a European or American.
中国政府经常警告日韩不要卷入台湾问题，将美国描述为操纵盟友的木偶大师。《环球时报》在上周三的一篇社评中把同意参加戴维营峰会的韩国比作“幼儿园的孩子被老师奖励了小红花”。社评称，这种兴奋应该被“紧张与谨慎”取代。中国也在用种族特征来试图瓦解美日韩关系。无论头发染得再黄，鼻子修得再尖，也变不成西方人。

Mr. Li had four stores and closed two of them. He let go two-thirds of his employees and stopped investing in new products. He also cut back on dining out and hanging out with his buddies. Strapped for cash, he tried to sell an apartment he bought in 2020 as an investment. But there have been few queries, even after he cut the price to $400,000 from $500,000.Tremors in China’s real estate market are shaking the country’s economy, as well as the world, which has come to rely on China as a reliable engine of growth.
李先生曾有四家店，其中两家已关张。他解雇了三分之二的员工，也不再投资新产品。他还减少了下馆子和与朋友聚会的次数。由于现金短缺，他曾试图出售自己在2020年买的一套用于投资的公寓。但即使在他将售价从330万元降到290万元后，也几乎无人问津。中国房地产市场的震荡正在动摇中国经济，也动摇了已经开始依赖中国作为可靠增长引擎的世界经济。

Chinese banks extended $47.5 billion of new renminbi loans, tumbling 89 percent from June — and half the amount of a year earlier. Housing sales in terms of footage fell 6.5 percent in the first seven months of the year, after shrinking by nearly a quarter last year. In a country where three-fifths of the household assets are tied up in real estate, that decline is alarming.
中国各银行的人民币贷款增加了3459亿元，与6月份相比减少了89%，只是去年同期的一半。今年前七个月的商品房销售面积与去年同期相比下降了6.5%，而去年的商品房销售面积已经萎缩了近25%。在这个60%的家庭资产与房地产捆绑在一起的国家，这种下降令人震惊。

Home prices have slumped, denting Chinese households’ savings, and confidence, as the government tries to transition from an economy powered by state-directed investments and exports to one led by domestic consumer spending.The government recently outlined programs aimed at spurring spending and investment, but the details have been opaque.That said, the reaction from global investors has been relatively muted so far. 
在政府试图从国家主导的投资和出口驱动的经济转型为国内消费支出主导的经济之际，房价暴跌，削弱了中国家庭的储蓄和信心。政府最近出台了刺激支出和投资的计划，但细节仍不明确。尽管如此，迄今为止全球投资者的反应相对平静。

The 2008 crisis was brought on by the bursting of a huge, trans-Atlantic housing bubble. The effects of the burst bubble were magnified by financial disruption, especially the collapse of “shadow banks” — institutions that acted like banks, created the risk of what amounted to bank runs, but were both largely unregulated and lacking the safety net provided to conventional banks.Now comes China, with a real estate sector even more swollen than those of Western nations in the run-up to 2008.many potential investors fear that the nation may be a kind of Roach Motel: You can get in, but you may not be able to get out.
2008年的危机是由大西洋两岸巨大的房地产泡沫破裂引发的。金融混乱放大了泡沫破裂的影响，尤其是“影子银行”的崩溃——这些机构以银行的方式行事，制造了相当于银行挤兑的风险，但在很大程度上不受监管，也缺乏为传统银行提供的安全网。现在轮到中国了，在2008年之前，中国的房地产行业比西方国家还要膨胀。许多潜在投资者担心这个国家可能是一个捕蟑螂器：进得去，但是可能出不来。

None of this means that we should welcome the possibility of a Chinese slump or gloat over another nation’s troubles. Even on purely selfish grounds, we should worry about what the Chinese regime might do to distract its citizens from domestic problems.
这并不意味着我们应该乐见中国经济衰退的可能性，或者对另一个国家的麻烦幸灾乐祸。即使纯粹出于自私的考虑，我们也应该担心中国政府会采取什么措施来分散其国民对国内问题的注意力。

At a moment when Washington is trying to reset its tense relationship with China, states across the country are leaning into anti-Chinese sentiment and crafting or enacting sweeping rules aimed at severing economic ties with Beijing.The restrictions coincide with a resurgence of anti-China sentiment, inflamed in part by a Chinese spy balloon that traveled across the United States this year and by heated political rhetoric ahead of the 2024 election.
就在华盛顿试图重启与中国的紧张关系之际，美国各州走向反中情绪，制定或颁布旨在切断与北京经济联系的全面规定。这些限制措施出台之际，反中情绪再度抬头，部分原因是今年中国的一个间谍气球飞过美国，以及2024年大选前激烈的政治言论。

The state moves, some of which also include investments coming from Russia, Iran and North Korea, have raised the ire of business groups that fear the rules will be too onerous or opponents who view them as discriminatory. Some of the proposals wound up being watered down amid the backlash.
这些州的举措——其中一些还将来自俄罗斯、伊朗和朝鲜的投资包括在内——引发了商业团体的愤怒，它们担心这些规定过于严厉，另外一些反对者则认为这些规定具有歧视性。在强烈反对的声音中，一些提议最终做了淡化处理。

You might want to get tough on China, but if you don’t really think through what the second- and third-order effects might be, you could just end up hurting your state revenues and your property market while also failing to solve an actual national security problem.Their fear is that such actions would not just deprive Chinese investors of good investment opportunities in the U.S.
你可能想对中国采取强硬态度，但如果你没有真正考虑到可能的二阶和三阶效应，你最终可能会损害州收入和房地产市场，同时也无法实际解决国家安全问题。他们担心此类行为不仅会剥夺中国投资者在美国的良好投资机会

Even in the future, when we have reached a higher level of development and are equipped with more substantial financial resources, we still must not aim too high or go overboard with social security, and steer clear of the idleness-breeding trap of welfarism
即使将来发展水平更高、财力更雄厚了，也不能提过高的目标，搞过头的保障，坚决防止落入‘福利主义’养懒汉的陷阱

When Mr. Zhou, the former central bank chief, unleashed a surge of borrowing in 2016, he triggered a frenzy of apartment construction even in remote cities like Qiqihar, a fading, frozen center of artillery manufacturing near the Siberian frontier. As easy credit sent apartment prices skyward, people in Qiqihar and throughout the country felt richer and flocked to car dealerships and other businesses to spend more money.
央行前行长周小川2016年推动银行大量发放房贷后，许多城市出现了公寓建设热潮，就连齐齐哈尔这样的偏远城市也不例外。离西伯利亚不远的齐齐哈尔天气寒冷，主要工业是日渐衰落的火炮制造。随着宽松的信贷导致房价飞涨，齐齐哈尔和全国各地的人们觉得自己更有钱了，他们纷纷涌入汽车经销店和其他商店，花更多的钱买东西。

Apartments in China are commonly delivered by builders without amenities like sinks and washing machines, or even basics like closets or flooring. Cutting interest rates is necessary,It is about stabilizing the property sector and offering calibrated relief to companies and local governments that are experiencing financing woes.
在中国，开发商交付的公寓通常是毛坯房，没有厨卫设施以及洗衣机等家电，甚至没有壁橱或地板等基本的东西。有必要降息，降息是为了稳定房地产行业，也是为面临财务困难的公司和地方政府提供有针对性的救援。

China cannot export its way out of economic trouble without incurring considerable hostility from governments in Europe, the United States and developing countries, which have become increasingly reluctant to accept job losses associated with a dependence on imports. But that may be a risk that China is willing to take as pressure increases for further interest rate cuts.
中国不能靠增加出口走出经济泥潭，因为那会招致欧洲国家、美国，以及发展中国家政府的强烈不满，这些国家已越来越不愿意接受依赖进口导致的失业。但随着进一步降息的压力加大，这也许是中国愿意承担的风险。

On the eve of the first debate of the 2024 presidential race, trust in government is rivaling historic lows. Officials have been working hard to safeguard elections and assure citizens of their integrity. But if we want public office to have integrity, we might be better off eliminating elections altogether.The ancient Greeks invented democracy, and in Athens many government officials were selected through sortition — a random lottery from a pool of candidates. 
在2024年总统竞选首场辩论前夕，人们对政府的信任度正跌向历史低点。官员们一直在努力维护选举，并向公民保证这些选举是公正的。但如果我们想要保证公职的诚信正直，还不如完全取消选举。古希腊人发明了民主，在雅典，许多政府官员都是通过抽签选出的——从候选人池中随机抽取。

Mr. Modi was greeted on arrival in Johannesburg by a large billboard and a line of South Africans of Indian descent — business and cultural leaders carefully vetted by a local interest group.We cannot accept the greedy neocolonialism that imposes trade barriers and discriminatory measures under the guise of protecting the environment
莫迪抵达约翰内斯堡时，迎接他的是一块巨大的广告牌和一排印度裔南非人，他们是经当地一个利益集团仔细审查过的商界和文化界领袖。我们不能接受贪婪的新殖民主义在保护环境的幌子下，强加贸易壁垒和歧视性措施

For the smallest of the BRICS countries, South Africa, whose economic and political woes have created a despondent national atmosphere, politicians see pulling off an international event of this scale as a rare win.Facing waning domestic popularity, Mr. Ramaphosa is casting himself as an international statesman and his country as the voice of Africa.
对于金砖国家中最小的国家南非来说，其经济和政治困境造成了一种沮丧的国家气氛，政治人士认为成功举办如此规模的国际活动是难得的胜利。面对国内民众支持率的下降，拉马福萨正在把自己塑造成一位国际政治家，把他的国家塑造成非洲的代言人。

Last month, Mr. Putin pulled out of the deal, saying that the provisions benefiting Russia had been ignored or were inadequate, and his forces began the systematic destruction of Ukrainian grain and port facilities. 
上个月，普京退出了该协议，称有利于俄罗斯的条款被忽视或不充分，他的部队开始有系统地破坏乌克兰的粮食和港口设施。

“The Biden crime family,” he claimed, had received millions of dollars from foreign countries. “I believe we have a compromised president,” Mr. Trump said, adding: “He’s a Manchurian candidate. That’s why Crooked Joe is letting other countries walk all over the United States.”
他声称，“拜登犯罪家族”从外国获得了数以百万计的美元。“我相信我们的总统已经被搞定了，”特朗普说，他还说：“他是傀儡。这就是为什么奸人乔让别的国家在美国横行霸道。”

But globalization also means you can’t reduce China’s contribution to the global economy over those years to the matter of its own G.D.P. — because through its boom China reshaped the world’s markets, becoming a natural commercial and financial hub, infrastructure leader, universal trade partner and demand sponge, soaking up much of what Asia and the world as a whole had to offer up or make.
但全球化也意味着，你不能把中国这些年对全球经济的贡献仅仅归结为其自身的GDP。因为中国靠自身的繁荣重塑了全球市场，成为天然的商业和金融中心、基础设施领导者、全球贸易伙伴和需求海绵，吸收了亚洲和整个世界所能供应或制造的大部分产品。

President Xi Jinping of China, traveling to Africa for the first time in five years, pledged greater cooperation with South Africa to enhance the voice of poor nations. He commended developing countries for “shaking off the yoke of colonialism.”At present, the Cold War mentality is lingering, and the geopolitical situation is grim,The grouping should “bring more countries into the BRICS family so as to pool our strength, pool our wisdom to make global governance more just and equitable.”
中国国家主席习近平在五年来首次访问非洲，承诺与南非加强合作，增加贫困国家的发言权。他称赞发展中国家“大多是从殖民主义的历史泥淖中”走到今天的。当前，冷战思维阴魂不散，地缘政治形势严峻，该集团应该“让更多国家加入到金砖大家庭，集众智、汇群力，推动全球治理朝着更加公正合理的方向发展”。

Putin is someone who generally thinks that revenge is a dish best served cold,So he’s going to try to settle the situation to the extent he can. But, again, in my experience, Putin is the ultimate apostle of payback. So I would be surprised if Prigozhin escapes further retribution for this.
普京是那种认为君子报仇十年不晚的人，所以他会尽其所能稳定这个局面。但又说回来，根据我的经验，普京是最执著于报复的人。所以，如果普里戈任接下来能继续逃脱惩罚，我会很惊讶。

Saito’s critics have called him out for castigating the capitalist system he has benefited from while providing little more than unworkable idealism and failed ideology as an alternative. His book has ignited a publishing boomlet on Marxism in Japan, with some works attacking his ideas and others supporting them.
斋藤的批评者指责他，称他从资本主义制度中受益，却转而批评资本主义，同时只给出了行不通的理想主义和失败的意识形态作为替代方案。他的书在日本掀起了马克思主义书籍的出版热潮，一些作品攻击他的观点，另一些则支持他的观点。

The threadbare social safety net has contributed to the glut of apartments, as families kept buying extra homes as investments they could sell in case of hard times.The Covid pandemic magnified the problem.
充满漏洞的社会安全网是公寓过剩的原因之一，因为家庭把不断购买额外的房子作为投资，以便他们在有经济困难时卖房变现。新冠病毒大流行加剧了这个问题。

Otherwise a system built on informal, conceptual principles and practices, rather than on institutions, risks becoming unmanageable,The absence of clear signs of the punishment of Prigozhin,” and the fact that he seemed to travel freely within Russia, “were increasingly interpreted as signs of helplessness and flabbiness in the system.
否则，一个建立在非正式的、观念性的原则和实践而非制度之上的体系，就有可能变得难以管理，没有对普里戈任的明确惩罚，”以及他似乎在俄罗斯境内自由活动的事实，“越来越多地被解读为这个体系的无助和软弱。

Though his forces stood down, Mr. Prigozhin could hardly take back all that he had said in tirades against the Russian military leadership. His broadsides risked gaining traction among the Russian public, as he attacked corrupt and incompetent Russian elites waging an ill-managed war with little concern for the lives of rank-and-file soldiers.
尽管他的军队停了下来，但普里戈任针对俄罗斯军事领导层的长篇大论已是覆水难收。他攻击俄罗斯精英腐败无能，称他们发动了一场管理不善的战争，几乎不关心普通士兵的生命，他的这些猛烈抨击有可能引起俄罗斯公众的关注。

For two months, Mr. Prigozhin functioned as a kind of ghost. He moved around Russia stealthily. He ceased releasing public statements. He slipped back into the shadows from which he had emerged the previous year.Mr. Putin, all the while, chipped away at the mercenary chief’s stature in public.
两个月来，普里戈任就像一个影子。他在俄罗斯各地偷偷摸摸地活动。他不再发表公开声明。他去年从暗处现身，现在又回到了暗处。而普京一直在公开削弱这位雇佣军首领的形象。

Flashy sales offices have long played a key role in bringing in cash that property developers needed to keep growing. Most companies sold apartments before a project was finished, with customers paying upfront.Inside the sales offices, agents dressed in suits typically pitch potential buyers on the bells and whistles. A miniature model of the residential complex gives a sense of what the complex will look like when it is built. A tour of a model apartment, often decorated lavishly, sells them on a lifestyle.
长久以来，豪华的售楼处为房地产开发商带来保持增长所需的现金方面发挥着关键作用。大多数开发商都是出售期房，让客户提前付款。售楼处里西装革履的销售通常会对潜在买家说得天花乱坠。模型展示了小区建成后的样子。参观通常装饰奢华的样板房则是在向客户推销一种生活方式。
