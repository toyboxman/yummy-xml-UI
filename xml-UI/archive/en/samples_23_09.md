One social media account backed by China’s state broadcaster released a video that purported to investigate how foreign news outlets had cherry-picked statistics that predicted higher economic growth, just so they could later say China fell short. “At the end of the day, they are fated to be slapped in the face by reality,” a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry said this month about the purported Western naysayers.
中国国家电视台支持的一个社交媒体帐号发布了一段视频，揭露外国媒体如何故意筛选预测中国经济更高增长的数据，以便之后唱衰中国。“（他们）最终难逃被现实打脸的命运，”中国外交部发言人本月在谈到所谓的西方唱反调者时表示

America’s global dominance, to be sure, is underwritten by vast military spending, a network of alliances and hundreds of far-flung military bases. Since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991 and despite the disastrous interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, America has been able to portray itself as speaking for the values of freedom and democracy everywhere. In fact, the disproportionate sway Washington holds over the articulation of global norms is a major source of its power.
诚然，美国的全球主导地位离不开庞大军费支出、同盟国家网络以及星罗棋布的军事基地的支撑。自1991年苏联解体以来，美国对伊拉克和阿富汗的干预虽然导致了灾难性后果，但依然能自诩为全球自由和民主价值的代言人。事实上，对全球规范的表述拥有不成比例的影响力，正是华盛顿权力的主要来源。

Of the 11 states that will make up the expanded group, four can be said to be democracies, four are autocracies, two are monarchies and another a theocracy. It is further evidence that a country’s political system is a poor indicator of how it frames its interests and with whom it decides to build a coalition.
在扩张后的11个国家里，四个算得上民主国家，四个是专制国家，两个是君主国家，还有一个则是神权国家。这进一步证明，一个国家的政治制度并不能真正反映其界定自身利益的方式和寻找伙伴建立同盟的决定。

Incongruously, Yi Fuxian, one of the world’s experts on China’s demographic plight, specializes in pre-eclampsia — a complication of pregnancy — and works in Wisconsin. His day job is as a senior scientist in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. In his native China, though, he’s far better known for his off-hours specialty, which is warning the Chinese people about the serious consequences of their baby bust.
在威斯康星州工作的易富贤是研究中国人口困境的世界级专家之一，他专门研究先兆子痫——一种妊娠并发症。他的正职是威斯康星大学麦迪逊分校的妇产科高级科学家。不过，在他的祖国中国，他更出名的是他业余时间的专长，那就是警告中国人生育率低落的严重后果。

In March, a Gallup poll found that while Democrats were 23 points more likely to consider Russia a greater enemy than China, Republicans were a whopping 64 points more likely to say the reverse. There is evidence that this discrepancy stems in part from the fact that while President Vladimir Putin of Russia casts himself as a defender of conservative Christian values, President Xi Jinping leads a nonwhite superpower whose regime has spurned the Christian destiny many Americans once envisioned for it.
今年3月，盖洛普的一项民意调查发现，在民主党人中，认为俄罗斯是比中国更大的敌人的人，要多出23个百分点，而共和党人反过来，认为中国是更大敌人的多出64个点。有证据表明，造成这种差异的部分原因是，俄罗斯总统普京将自己塑造成保守基督教价值观的捍卫者，而习近平主席则领导着一个非白人超级大国，其政权拒绝了许多美国人曾经构想的基督教宿命

BYD, an all-electric Chinese carmaker that overtook Volkswagen as China’s best-selling brand this year, unveiled a sleek, new sedan and a sport utility vehicle to applause from a packed crowd.I think the Europeans are just pretty much petrified of how the Chinese will perform in Europe.The doldrums extend beyond automakers. 
中国的纯电动汽车制造商比亚迪今年在国内的销量已超过大众汽车，成为中国最畅销的品牌。它在此次车展上推出了一款时尚新型轿车和一款运动型多用途车，赢得满堂彩。我认为欧洲人几乎被中国企业在欧洲的表现吓呆了。经济低迷的涉及范围超出汽车制造业

Two workers have been detained in northern China after the local authorities said they plowed through a section of the country’s Great Wall with an excavator, leaving a gaping hole.The pair, a 38-year-old man and 55-year-old-woman, caused “irreversible damage” when they used the construction equipment to widen an existing gap and create a shortcut that was large enough to drive the excavator through it
中国北方当地政府称，两名工人用挖掘机挖开了一段长城，留下一个大缺口，两人已遭刑事拘留。一名38岁男子和一名55岁女子为了节省路程让挖掘机通过，将长城原有豁口挖得更大，造成了“不可逆的破坏”。

The Great Wall, which served as a fortress protecting the territory from invasions under successive Chinese empires, spans more than 13,000 miles. The most well-preserved section is around 5,500 miles long. In 1987, the wall was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.The Great Wall has long faced the dual threats of erosion and human activity, with locals stealing bricks to use as construction materials or to sell, and in more recent times, tourists etching carvings into the stone.
长城是历代中华帝国保护领土免遭入侵的防御要塞，绵延两万多公里。保存最完好的部分长约8800公里。1987年，长城被联合国教科文组织列为世界文化遗产。长久以来，长城一直面临着自然侵蚀和人类活动的双重威胁，当地人会偷窃城墙石块用作建筑材料或出售，而近代以来，游客也会在石墙上刻字。

China and India are also deeply at odds over their shared border, a dispute that was inflamed last week when China’s Ministry of Natural Resources released a map that asserted jurisdiction over the entire northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh and the Aksai Chin region, a high-altitude plateau claimed by both countries.China has described the map as routine and urged countries not to “over-interpret the issue.”
中印还在边境问题上存在深刻分歧，双方的冲突在上周再度升温，因为中国的自然资源部发布了一张地图，将印度东北部的整个阿鲁纳恰尔邦和阿克赛钦地区划为本国疆域，后者是一片两国都声称拥有主权的高原。中国称发布地图是例行性做法，呼吁各方不要“过度解读”。

With the biopic “Oppenheimer,” due July 21, the writer-director Christopher Nolan, known for brain-twisting films like “Interstellar” and “Inception,” addresses an old childhood dread — one based not on science fiction but on real science, namely the threat of thermonuclear war and human annihilation.
传记电影《奥本海默》(Oppenheimer)于7月21日上映之际，以《星际穿越》(Interstellar)和《盗梦空间》(Inception)等烧脑电影闻名的编剧兼导演克里斯托弗·诺兰，讲述了儿时的一个恐惧——不是基于科幻小说，而是基于真实的科学，即热核战争和人类灭绝的威胁。

His story is central to the way in which we live now and the way we are going to live forever. It absolutely changed the world in a way that no one else has changed the world. You talk about the advent of the printing press or something. He gave the world the power to destroy itself. No one has done that before.For better or for worse, I really believe him to be one of the more clearly ambiguous figures in history.
他的故事对我们当下乃至将来的生活方式是至关重要的。它绝对改变了世界，在某种程度上是无人能及的。你可以说还有印刷的出现之类的事情。但是他给了世界毁灭自己的力量。这是前无古人的。不管是好是坏，我真的相信他是历史上最模棱两可的人物之一。

It was a continual process of surprise. Sometimes you’d have a really invigorating discussion about what’s really going on, because this is a story where people’s behavior, political or personal, is riddled with ambiguities.
惊喜是持续不断的。有时我们会就现实到底发生了什么进行一番真正令人振奋的讨论，因为在这个故事里，无论动机出于政治还是私人，角色的行为都有很多暧昧不明之处。

After years of quality gains and technology improvements, Chinese cars, even ones with out-of-fashion combustion engines, are turning heads at industry events like the Munich auto show this week.Shipyards up and down the Yangtze River, with thousands of workers, clang and rattle from dawn until far into the night. 
经过多年的质量提升和技术改进，中国制造的汽车——即使是不合乎潮流的内燃机汽车，也已在行业活动中引起了人们的注意，比如本周的慕尼黑车展。在长江沿岸的造船厂里，数千名工人敲敲打打干活的声音从黎明到深夜一直不断。

The annual Group of 20 summit brings together world leaders in pursuit of a lofty goal: coordinating policy for the global economy.But, as with a lot of G20 statements, follow-through has been weak.Some critics argue that the G20 was flawed from the start, with a membership roster based on the whims of Western finance officials and central bankers.
一年一度的20国集团(G20)峰会让世界各国领导人齐聚一堂，共同追求一个宏大目标：协调全球经济政策。但是，就像G20之前做出的许多声明一样，它也是后续乏力。一些批评人士认为，G20从一开始就有缺陷，成员名单完全是西方财政官员和央行官员拍脑门想出来的。

When the G20 started, there was more consensus about how to hold the world together. Free trade was ascendant; great power rivalry seemed but a memory; and optimists worldwide hoped that the G20 would lead to a broader power base for aging institutions like the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund.
G20成立之初，人们就如何将世界团结在一起达成了更多共识。当时，自由贸易方兴未艾；大国竞争似乎只是一种记忆；世界各地的乐观主义者希望G20能为联合国和国际货币基金组织等老化的机构带来更广泛的权力基础。

Those hopes are still there, and blossoming elsewhere. But conflicts have supplanted G20 team efforts.There’s a lot more dissatisfaction with hyper-globalization, open trade and free capital,In a situation where the global economy is fracturing and countries are pursuing their own thing, the question is, what do you do when you still have rules and institutions that were created for a very different environment?
这些希望仍然存在，并在其他地方开花结果。人们对超全球化、开放贸易和自由资本的不满情绪比以前大很多，在全球经济分崩离析、各国各自为政的情况下，问题在于，当你拥有的是一个为截然不同的环境制定的规则和制度时，你该怎么办

It is increasingly clear that the existing, Western-oriented approach is no longer adequate to address the many forces governing international power relations.Western policy preferences will prevail less” and “each country will have to be granted greater leeway in managing its economy, society and political system.”
越来越明显的是，以西方为导向的现有手段已不足以应对主导国际权力关系的诸多力量。“西方的政策偏好将不再占据上风”，而且“每个国家在管理经济、社会和政治制度方面获得更大的回旋余地”。

Beyond facilitating Chinese military adventurism in the South China Sea, the new base could provide the People’s Liberation Army, or P.L.A., with a staging ground to monitor and influence vital maritime routes like the Malacca Strait, through which an estimated 40 percent of the world’s trade flows.But the base also shines a light on Beijing’s broader embrace of an innovative strategy to challenge American military strength that has potentially grave implications for Washington and its allies.
除了为中国在南海的军事冒险提供便利外，新基地还可以为中国人民解放军提供一个集结地，监控和影响马六甲海峡等重要海上航线，据估计，世界上40%的贸易都要经过马六甲海峡。但是，该基地也揭示了北京更广泛地采用创新战略来挑战美国的军事实力，可能对华盛顿及其盟友产生严重影响。

Yet as China has rolled out this far-reaching strategy over the past several years, the U.S. government has often seemed to be playing a reactive game of Whac-a-Mole. 
然而，随着中国在过去几年里推出这一影响深远的战略，美国政府似乎经常在玩被动的“打地鼠”游戏。

America likes to think of itself in garlanded terms. The shining city on a hill. The indispensable nation. The land of the free. There’s something to each sobriquet, to be sure. But there’s another phrase, not always so flattering, that also applies to the United States: global empire.
美国喜欢用溢美之词来形容自己。闪闪发光的山巅之城。不可或缺的国家。自由人的家园。当然，每个绰号都有其道理。但还有另一个并不总是那么讨人喜欢的说法也适用于美国：全球帝国。

Like modern America, Rome attained a degree of supremacy unprecedented in its day. But the paradox of great imperial systems is that they often sow the seeds of their own downfall. As Rome grew rich and powerful from the economic exploitation of its peripheries, it inadvertently spurred the development of territories beyond its European frontiers. In time, the larger and politically more coherent confederations that emerged acquired the ability to parry — and eventually roll back — imperial domination.
和现代美国一样，罗马达到了当时前所未有的至高无上的地位。但伟大帝国制度的矛盾之处在于它们往往为自己的衰落埋下了种子。罗马通过对其周边地区的经济剥削而变得富强，无意中刺激了其欧洲疆域以外领土的发展。随着时间推移，出现了规模更大、政治上更团结的联盟，它们获得了抵御并最终击退罗马帝国统治的能力。

America’s global dominance, to be sure, is underwritten by vast military spending, a network of alliances and hundreds of far-flung military bases. To perpetuate its primacy, Washington also tends to divide the world into regions.This divide-and-conquer approach acts to limit middle powers’ horizons to their own regions. 
诚然，美国的全球主导地位离不开庞大军费支出、同盟国家网络以及星罗棋布的军事基地的支撑。为了维持其主导地位，华盛顿还倾向于将世界分为不同区域。这种分而治之的手段将中等强国的视野局限在本国所在的区域。

Torrential rains have pounded southern China, flooding low-lying homes and roads, choking expressways, and prompting officials to suspend classes while the recording-breaking storms lingered over the region.The rainstorms were caused by remnants of Typhoon Haikui, which had been grinding along the Chinese coast until striking the densely populated tip of Guangdong Province, home to much of China’s manufacturing and commerce.
暴雨袭击了中国南方，低处的房屋和道路被淹没，高速公路被堵塞，官员们被迫下令停课，而破纪录的暴雨天气仍在该地区久久不去。此次暴雨是由台风“海葵”的余威造成的。台风一直沿着中国沿海地区移动，最后侵袭人口密集的广东省，那里是许多中国制造业和商业重镇所在的地方。

At the same time, an expanding higher education system is churning out ever larger numbers of graduates who are not settling for the tedious factory jobs of yesteryear.The government is also resorting to an old playbook. In recent years, many disillusioned young Chinese have joined in an antiwork movement known as lying flat, slacking off as a form of silent resistance.
与此同时，不断扩张的高等教育体系正在向社会输送越来越多的毕业生，过去那种枯燥的工厂职业已经无法满足他们。政府也在采用老一套的做法。近年来，许多幻想破灭的中国年轻人加入了一场名为“躺平”的反工作运动，以偷懒当作无声的反抗。

It’s outrageous that President Biden has chosen to upgrade diplomatic ties with Vietnam at a time when the one-party state is in the middle of a brutal crackdown on activism, dissent, and civil society,Despite lofty rhetoric about promoting a ‘rules-based international order’ and defending freedom, Biden is once again cozying up to autocrats with atrocious human rights records.The U.S.-Vietnam relationship started off slow because of mistrust. 
在这个一党制国家残酷镇压社运、异见和公民社会之际，拜登总统选择升级对越外交关系着实令人愤慨，尽管拜登高调宣扬要推动建立‘基于规则的国际秩序’并捍卫自由，但他却再次讨好人权记录恶劣的独裁者。由于缺乏信任，美越关系的起步十分缓慢。

Some leaders still publicly liken the relationship between Vietnam and China, which share an 800-mile border, to that of “comrades and brothers.” But the two countries have a tense and painful history — including a millennium-long stretch in which China was Vietnam’s colonial overlord — that has left Vietnam deeply wary of its largest neighbor.Vietnam has “paid lip service” to Chinese programs such as the Belt and Road Initiative but has resisted making any commitments to them
中越边境线长达1300公里，一些领导人仍在公开场合将两国关系比作“同志加兄弟”。但两国之间有着紧张而痛苦的历史——包括中国在长达千年里曾是越南的殖民霸主——这让越南对其最大的邻国深感警惕。越南对“一带一路”等中国项目“口头上表示赞同”，但拒绝做出任何承诺。

For decades, America’s corporate chieftains saw China as a money spinner. They gushed about its hundreds of millions of consumers, those executives have come away from recent visits to the country with a more sober view.Many Western companies still see their China operations as a long-term bet, but the payoff is tempered with hazards.The conversation about China in corporate boardrooms is inexorably shifted toward more caution, Companies are trying to balance the political scrutiny with a belief 
过去数十年里，美国的企业老总们将中国视作一棵摇钱树。他们夸张地称赞中国的数亿消费者，这些高管们在最近访华后带回了更清醒的看法。许多西方公司仍将中国业务视为它们押下的长期赌注，尽管回报受到了风险的牵累。企业董事会会议上有关中国的讨论正在不可避免地转向更加谨慎,美国企业极力在政治审查与这样一种信念之间寻找平衡

For Moderna, China’s large base of patients, deep pockets for pharmaceutical research and resources for clinical trials probably contributed to its decision to collaborate, Moderna is facing waning demand for the vaccine, the company’s only commercially viable product.it would be malpractice for corporate executives to stand pat,
对莫德纳来说，中国庞大的患者群体、药物研发方面的大量投资，以及临床试验资源，可能是它决定与中国合作的部分原因。莫德纳正面临着新冠疫苗需求下降的问题，该疫苗是公司在商业上可行的唯一产品.企业高管们照常行事就是玩忽职守

To turn the theater into a tourist destination and to sing on the bones of the dead is incredible cynicism and disrespect for the memory of the dead civilians.Looking at the camera, she sings an excerpt from the Soviet-era patriotic song “Katyusha” and lifts her arms triumphantly into the air.the authorities might have been concerned about the “tone deafness” of the video.I do not and will not tolerate racism and blind hatred and bullying
把剧院变成旅游景点，在死者尸骨上唱歌，这是令人难以置信的嘲讽，是对缅怀遇难平民的不敬。对着镜头，她唱了一段苏联时代的爱国歌曲《喀秋莎》，并以胜利的姿态向空中举起双臂。当局可能对该视频的“没眼力劲”感到担忧。我现在和将来都不会容忍种族主义、盲目的仇恨和霸凌。

the public was pushing the limits of self-expression and individualism. The battle over the height of women’s heels and the length of men’s hair embodied the struggle.Flared pants and bluejeans were considered “weird attire.” Some government buildings barred men with long hair and women wearing makeup and jewelry. Patrols organized by factories and schools cut flared pants and long hair with scissors.
公众也在不断挑战自我表达和个人主义的极限。女性鞋跟高矮和男性头发长短之争都体现了这样的拉扯。喇叭裤和牛仔裤被视为“奇装异服”。一些政府场所禁止男性留长发，禁止女性化妆和佩戴首饰。工厂学校都会组织巡逻队，看到喇叭裤和长发就用剪刀剪掉。

If officials can arbitrarily expand interpretations and applications of the law based on personal preferences and ideological beliefs,we may not be far from the concept of ‘if you want to accuse someone, you can always find a pretext.
如果公职人员可以凭个人偏好和观念信条，随意扩张解释和适用法律，那么我们距离‘欲加之罪、何患无辞’也就不远了

More than 160 people were killed in Ryongchon, near the Chinese border, in April 2004, when trains laden with combustible material exploded because of a collision or an electrical malfunction.
2004年4月，在靠近中国边境的龙村，满载易燃物的火车因碰撞或电气故障而发生爆炸，造成160多人死亡。

China sees us now as the soft underbelly of the NATO alliance,Our policy seems to entail not upsetting China.the British government was unlikely to deviate from its current approach, which delicately balances an acknowledgment of China as an “epoch-defining challenge” with a cold-eyed pragmatism about the need to preserve commercial ties.
中国现在把我们视为北约联盟的软肋，我们的政策似乎就是不要惹恼中国。政府不太可能偏离目前的做法——在承认中国是“划时代的挑战”与维护两国商业关系的冷静实用主义之间，保持微妙的平衡。

Libya, a North African nation splintered by a war, was ill-prepared for the storm, called Daniel, which swept across the Mediterranean Sea to batter its coastline. The flooding left bodies scattered in the streets while buckling buildings, sinking vehicles and blocking roads, impeding access to the most stricken areas.We still cannot comprehend the magnitude of what has happened,The shock we are experiencing is terrible.
这个被战争撕裂的北非国家对飓风“丹尼尔”准备不足，这场风暴已经席卷了地中海，侵袭了利比亚的海岸线。洪水过后的街道尸横遍野，建筑倒塌，车辆被淹，道路堵塞，导致难以进入受灾最严重的地区。我们仍然不知道这场灾难到底有多严重，我们所经历的冲击实在太可怕了。

Analysts said the country’s woes — political division, economic instability, corruption, environmental degradation and dilapidated infrastructure — seemed to coalesce in one catastrophe when the dams south of the city collapsed. We say Mother Nature, but this is the act of man — it’s the incompetence of Libya’s political elites,There’s no words you can find to describe the biblical level of suffering those people have to endure.Citizens who escaped Derna left the city “as if they were born today, with nothing,”
分析人士称，利比亚政治分裂、经济不稳定、腐败、环境恶化和基础设施破败的种种问题似乎都在德尔纳南部大坝垮塌后的灾难中同时爆发出来了。都说是天灾，其实是人祸——这是利比亚政治精英阶层的无能，已经找不到任何语言来形容人民所要承受的苦难是多么深重了。逃离德尔纳的居民都是“孑然一身，就像当初赤条条来到人世一样”。

The storm struck Louisiana and became a calamity after levees in New Orleans ruptured, inundating vast parts of the city.It also underscored how climate change can combine with political conflicts and economic failure to magnify the scale of disasters.Warming causes the waters of the Mediterranean to expand and its sea levels to rise, eroding shorelines and contributing to flooding, with low-lying coastal areas of Libya at particular risk
那场飓风袭击了路易斯安那州，导致新奥尔良防洪堤决口，引发了该市大部分地区被淹的灾祸。如今这场洪灾也凸显出，当气候变化遇上政治冲突和经济衰败，其灾难规模将会如何扩大。全球变暖导致地中海水域扩大，海平面上升侵蚀海岸线，引发洪水泛滥，利比亚的低洼沿海地区尤其危险。

We’ve always been able to come together in the wake of humanitarian disasters and provide relief in the wake of earthquakes or hurricanes or fires,And to see this kind of pursuit instead is both, I think deeply disturbing and something that the global community should draw a red line around and put off-limits.
我们总是能在人道主义灾难发生后团结起来，为遭受地震、飓风或火灾破坏的人民提供帮助，现在看到这种利用灾难的事情，令人深感不安，我认为国际社会应该划定红线、禁止这种行为。

For more than a decade, China has courted developing countries frustrated with the West. Beijing’s rise from poverty was a source of inspiration.Neither the United States nor China is especially beloved among developing nations. 
在过去十多年里，中国一直在拉拢对西方不满的发展中国家。北京得以从贫困中崛起，成为一种励志的源泉。发展中国家对美中两国都不是特别拥戴。

India still has a long way to go to be called a great power.What a rising India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi is offering instead is less domineering and less tied to money or defense — effusively supportive rhetoric, an ear for shared grievances and a promise to diversify the institutions that shape global policy.At the summit, Mr. Modi embodied the role of bridge builder and friend.On the first day of the gathering, Mr. Modi announced the admission of the African Union with a bang of the gavel.  
印度距离成为真正的大国还有很长的路要走。但在莫迪总理领导下崛起的印度提出的主张没那么盛气凌人，也更少与利益或防务直接挂钩，而是热情洋溢的支持主张，倾听各国共同的不满，并承诺致力于全球政策制定机构的多元化。莫迪在峰会上扮演了调停和亲善的角色。在峰会首日，随着木槌敲响，莫迪宣布非洲联盟加入G20。

Money talks, Whether it’s India or the U.S. or Europe, if they are not able to match or be as serious as China with rolling out funding, China will still enjoy this place of leadership. Beijing does not intend to cede this position, and remains wary of New Delhi’s tilt toward the West as a means to contain China’s rise.But after a year at the helm of the G20, India is relishing a moment of national momentum on the international stage while trying to maintain strong global south relations.
有钱能使鬼推磨，无论是印度还是欧美，如果在投资额度或对待投资的严肃态度上都赶不上中国，那中国就仍将享有这样的领导地位。中国并不打算将这种地位拱手相让，也仍将对印度向西方靠拢以遏制中国崛起保持警惕。但在担任G20主席国的一年时间里，印度很享受在国际舞台上展示国家影响力，并试图维持全球南方紧密关系的机会。

They gazed into the workings of a rocket launchpad. They tucked into crab dumplings, sturgeon and entrecôte. two isolated leaders on wartime footing embraced each other in their moments of need.This has historically been a very mercantile, transactional relationship,The war is now the organizing principle of Russian foreign policy
他们注视着火箭发射台的工作情况。他们对蟹饺、鲟鱼和牛肋排大快朵颐。在各自的患难时刻，这两位受到孤立的战时领导人拥抱了彼此。从历史上看，这是一种非常唯利是图、利益交换式的关系，这场战争如今已成为俄罗斯外交政策的指导原则

The Vostochny Cosmodrome, built by Mr. Putin as part of a broader effort to restore Russia’s glory, was symbolic for two countries that have significant ambitions in space but have suffered recent setbacks.The two leaders met in a group with their respective ministers, including top defense officials, and afterward convened a tête-à-tête, ultimately talking for roughly two hours.
普京建造的东方太空发射场是他恢复俄罗斯荣光的整体行动的一部分，对这两个在太空领域雄心勃勃但近来都遭遇挫折的国家都极具象征意义。两位领导人与双方的部长们举行了集体会晤，高级国防官员也参与其中。随后他们还私聊一番，最终会谈持续了大约两小时。

They have set their sights on a barren plain in Gujarat, Dholera (DOE-lay-rah), designated the future home of India’s first “semicon city.” It’s the size of Singapore. Slicing through sodden fields, ruler-straight new roads connect planning offices to power stations, freshwater canals from a diverted river and the gargantuan outline, traced in the dust, of an international airport. Dholera’s vast grid is otherwise virtually empty.
他们把目光投向了古吉拉特邦的贫瘠平原多赫拉，这里被指定为印度首个“半导体城”的所在地。它的面积相当于新加坡。笔直的新路穿过泥泞的田野，将规划办公室与发电站、从改道河流中流出的淡水运河，以及飞沙中国际机场的巨大轮廓连接起来。除此之外，广袤的多赫拉几乎空空荡荡。

Chip-making, in its difficulty, occupies the opposite end of the spectrum.India has no history of fabbing chips and virtually none of the hyperspecialized engineers and equipment needed to start. Some business leaders — and not only Mr. Modi’s naysayers — argue that India’s government, in identifying logic-chip foundries as its goal, has bit off more than it can chew.
芯片制造在其难度上则要位居光谱的另一端。印度没有制造芯片的历史，也几乎没有制造芯片所需的高度专业化的工程师和设备。一些商界领袖——不仅仅是莫迪的反对者——认为，印度政府将逻辑芯片代工厂确定为目标，已经超出了它的能力范围。

Malaysia does some of that kind of work now, and India could nibble away at its market there while doubling down on chip design.Whether these plans succeed or fail, they make apparent a giant scale of ambition. They also make it clear that India sees a muscular role for the state, with a mixture of tariffs and subsidies to help its national champions off the ground and into global competition. 
马来西亚目前正在做从事这类工作，印度可以在加大芯片设计投入的同时，蚕食马来西亚的市场。无论这些计划是成功还是失败，它们都显示出远大的抱负。它们还清楚地表明，印度认为政府应该扮演强大的角色，通过关税和补贴的组合，来帮助本国的拳头企业起步，并参与全球竞争。

In the gloom of China’s economy, one area of business is booming: cosmetics.many Chinese consumers, wary of big-ticket purchases like apartments, are now splurging on lipstick, perfume, moisturizers and other personal care products.As China’s cosmetics companies are booming, imports of cosmetics are wilting under regulations that the country imposed on foreign manufacturers during the pandemic.I’m not talking about peanuts,For many French companies,China “represents between 30 and 35 percent of their total revenues.”
在中国经济低迷之际，化妆品行业却在蓬勃发展。许多中国消费者对房子等大宗商品的购买持谨慎态度，眼下却在口红、香水、保湿霜等个人护理产品上大肆挥霍。在中国化妆品企业蓬勃发展的同时，进口化妆品因疫情期间中国对外国制造商实施的规定而萎靡不振。我说的不是什么小钱，对许多法国公司来说，中国占它们总收入的30%到35%。

When I asked the girls about school, the older one recounted how on the first day several children, anxious from being unable to communicate with teachers who only spoke Mandarin, urinated and defecated in their pants.
我询问她们学校里的情况，年纪大的那个说到开学第一天几个孩子因为没法与只讲普通话的老师沟通而紧张不已，结果把大小便拉在裤子里的事情。

The fact is that compared to the P.R.C., we’re vastly outnumbered on the ground, but it’s on us to defend the American people here at home,The fact is that compared to the P.R.C., we’re vastly outnumbered on the ground, but it’s on us to defend the American people here at home,Espionage can halt a slide into war or smooth the path of delicate negotiations, but it can also speed nations toward armed conflict or cause diplomatic rifts.
现实是比起PRC，我们在一线上是在以寡敌众，但是在本土保卫美国人民是我们的责任，我认为这是我们这一代人要面对的挑战。谍报活动可以遏止一场战争的爆发，或为审慎的谈判铺平道路，但也可以让一个国家更快地走向武装冲突或导致外交纠纷。

China even has artificial intelligence software that can recognize faces and detect the gait of an American spy, meaning traditional disguises are not enough to avoid detection, according to a former intelligence official. American operatives now must spend days rather than hours taking routes to spot any tailing Chinese agents before meeting a source or exchanging messages, former intelligence officials say.
据一名前情报官员说，中国甚至有可以识别美国间谍面孔、检测其步态的人工智能软件，这意味着传统的伪装已不足以躲避侦查。前情报官员们称，美国特工现在需要花数天而非数小时的时间走迂回路线，以便发现和甩掉尾随其后的中国特工，然后才能与线人见面或交换信息。

Mr. Musk’s sprawling family has been a source of comfort amid the frequent turmoil of his industry-spanning business interests, Mr. Isaacson writes. But his relationship with his father, Errol, is a source of trauma that remains with him.Mr. Musk’s father is described as emotionally and physically abusive and is quoted speaking disparagingly of Black people. 
艾萨克森写道，在马斯克横跨整个产业的商业利益面临扰动之际，庞大的家族给他带来了安慰。但他与父亲埃罗尔的关系一直是他心灵创伤的根源。书中描述马斯克的父亲在情感上和身体上都有虐待倾向，还引用了他对黑人的轻蔑言论。

Mr. Musk’s politics defy simple categorization. Despite his attacks on liberal critics, his rants against “woke” Democrats and his occasional promotion of far-right conspiracy theories, he is portrayed as more disillusioned with the leftward drift of the Democratic Party than he is a fan of Republicans.Mr. Musk repeatedly professes not to be an admirer of former President Donald J. Trump, telling his biographer, “I’m not Trump’s fan. He’s disruptive.” Mr. Isaacson writes that Mr. Musk harbors a “deep disdain” for the former president “whom he considered a con man” and seemed, Mr. Musk says, “kind of nuts.”
马斯克的政治主张无法简单归类。尽管他攻击自由派批评者，怒斥“觉醒”的民主党人，偶尔宣扬极右翼阴谋论，但书中描绘他是对民主党的左倾倾向感到失望，而不是共和党的粉丝。马斯克一再声称自己不是前总统特朗普的崇拜者，他告诉自己的传记作者，“我不是特朗普的粉丝。他具有破坏性。”艾萨克森写道，马斯克对这位“他认为是个骗子”的前总统怀有“深深的蔑视”，马斯克说，前总统似乎“脑子有点不正常”。

When he was vice president, I went to a lunch with him in San Francisco where he droned on for an hour and was boring as hell, like one of those dolls where you pull the string and it just says the same mindless phrases over and over.
他还是副总统的时候，我和他在旧金山共进午餐，他絮絮叨叨地讲了一个小时，简直无聊透顶，就像那种玩偶，你拉一下绳子，它就会一遍又一遍说着那几句不过脑的话。

Mr. Musk’s decision to start X.AI came partly out of concerns about underpopulation.The amount of human intelligence, he noted, was leveling off because people were not having enough children. Meanwhile, the amount of computer intelligence was going up exponentially,Mr. Musk believed that “at some point, biological brainpower would be dwarfed by digital brainpower.”You can’t be in a constant fight for survival, always in adrenaline mode, and not have it hurt you,When you are no longer in a survive-or-die mode, it’s not that easy to get motivated every day.
马斯克决定创办X.AI，部分是出于对人口不足的担忧。类智能总量正进入平台期，因为人们没有足够的孩子。与此同时，计算机智能呈指数级增长，马斯克认为，“到了某个时候，生物智力将会在数字智力面前相形见绌。”你不可能一直在为生存而战，总是处于肾上腺素分泌模式而不受伤害，当你不再处于生死攸关的模式时，每天都有动力就不那么容易了。

If we abandon the core principles” of the United Nations Charter “to appease an aggressor, can any member state in this body feel confident that they are protected? If we allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure? I respectfully suggest the answer is no.While he took an unrelenting stance against Russia’s brutal war and warned against appeasing Moscow, he drew a more measured line on China
如果我们要抛弃”联合国宪章的核心原则，“去姑息一个侵略者，那么这个组织里的所有成员国，有谁还会相信自己是会得到保护的？如果我们容许乌克兰被瓜分，还有哪个国家的独立是有保障的？我怀着敬意提醒大家，答案是否定的。虽然对俄罗斯的残酷战争保持着绝不姑息的立场，并警告不要对莫斯科让步，但他对中国的态度相对谨慎

The United Nations’ secretary general, António Guterres, convened a special summit on Wednesday in New York City designed to highlight the efforts of the most ambitious global leaders on climate policy — and to implicitly shame those who are dragging their feet.We must make up time lost to foot-dragging, arm-twisting and the naked greed of entrenched interests raking in billions from fossil fuels.
周三，联合国秘书长古特雷斯在纽约召开特别峰会，旨在强调最具雄心的全球领导人在气候政策方面所做的努力，并含蓄地羞辱那些拖后腿的国家。我们必须弥补因拖延、说服工作，以及既得利益集团赤裸裸的贪婪而失去的时间，这些集团从化石燃料中攫取数十亿美元利润。

As the very first of the universal museums, the British Museum built its collection over several hundred years of colonial boondoggles and the result is a treasure house of epic proportions.But the museum is largely prohibited by law from disposing of its holdings, and it has often justified its position by invoking its ability to safeguard the world’s treasures.
作为全球首家普世博物馆，大英博物馆在数百年的殖民掠夺中建起巨大的收藏，成就了一座宏伟的文化宝库。但法律基本上禁止该馆放弃藏品，该馆也总以捍卫世界宝藏的能力为由来证明其立场的正当性。

That position no longer makes sense. The universal museum, a relic of the Enlightenment, was never truly universal: Virtually all universal museums reside in Western cities, far beyond the reach of many of the communities from which their objects were taken. And there is nothing enlightened about hoarding the world’s culture in storage, unseen by many and often, apparently, unsafe.
但这种正当性如今已经站不住脚。作为启蒙运动的遗迹，普世博物馆从来没有真正的普世价值：几乎所有普世博物馆都在西方城市，是许多千里之外的社会——那些被掠夺的地方——根本无法触及的。把世界文化囤积在许多人看不到且明显往往并不安全的仓库里，毫无启蒙意义可言。

From the air or from one of the city’s many observation decks, Tokyo appears as a vast sea of low- and midrise buildings laced with archipelagoes of high-rises, each island marking the location of a station along one of the city’s railroad lines. 
从空中或众多城市观景台上俯瞰，东京就像一片满是中低层建筑的广阔海洋，高楼大厦像群岛一样点缀其中，每座岛屿都是铁道线路上的一个站点。

One reason Tokyo looks forward is that little remains of the city’s past. Earthquakes, fires and American bombers destroyed much of the prewar city, and after the war, the rush to provide housing and the nation’s relative poverty produced a city that wasn’t meant to last. Some of the “billboard” buildings of the postwar era — cheaply built wooden structures dressed up with sheet-metal facades — still dot the city, slowly falling apart.
东京放眼未来的原因之一是，这座城市过去的东西已所剩无几。地震、火灾，加上“二战”期间美国的狂轰滥炸摧毁了城市战前的大部分地区，东京在战后急于为居民提供住房，而国家当时相对贫困，这意味着那时候盖房子不是为了持久。战后盖的一些“广告牌”建筑在东京仍可看到，但这些外面用金属板外墙装点的便宜木质建筑正在慢慢散架。

Kicking the can down the road will make choices more difficult for future generations. If we wait, the less inclusive, less compassionate, less calm elements within our society and many societies worldwide may someday call depopulation a crisis and exploit it to suit their agendas — of inequality, nationalism, exclusion or control.
一拖再拖只会让子孙后代的选择更加困难。如果我们继续等下去，世上那些不够包容、不够同情、不够冷静的分子可能会在某一天将人口减少称为一场危机，并将其用于他们的议程——不平等、民族主义、排外或操控。

His tabloids ran on the idea of publishing for readers as they were, not according to some platonic ideal of how one wished them to be. That meant pinups and prize giveaways and blaring scandal headlines.
他的小报的经营理念是，读者是什么人，它们就提供什么内容，它们不遵循某种希望读者成为什么样的人的柏拉图式理想。这意味着美女照片、内幕爆料和触目惊心的丑闻大标题。

Like Mr. Murdoch’s tabloids, Fox had an aesthetic that was key to its appeal. Where news programs once sought to project stability and gravitas, it had flash and energy. It had the tone and political attitude of conservative talk radio and the rah-rah spirit of TV sports (as well as the blinding graphics).
和默多克的小报一样，福克斯的审美是其吸引力的关键。以前的新闻节目追求稳定和庄严，福克斯追求的是花哨和活力。它有保守派谈话节目电台的语气和政治态度，也有电视体育节目的狂热精神（以及令人眼花缭乱的画面）

China’s policymakers now face a predicament. They could stay the course, risking social stability from the economic fallout. Or they could bail out firms to prop up the economy but undermine the message that risky behavior has consequences.Zhongzhi told investors two weeks later that it was conducting “asset liquidation and capital verification” and delaying redemptions.
中国的决策者现在面临一种困境。如果他们不救助“中植系”的话，其经济后果可能带来社会不稳定的风险。如果他们为支持经济出面救助陷入困境的公司的话，就会削弱政府希望释放的信息，即风险做法存在后果。两周后，中植告诉投资者们，正在进行“资产清算和验资”，再次推迟了赎回。

she took the pen name Jiang Xue — which literally means “river snow” — from a ninth-century poem about a fisherman alone in a boat on a snowy river. The image is one of the most indelible in Chinese poetry, implying a person holding out against the odds, in a solitary pursuit that many might not understand.
她取了笔名“江雪”——字面意思是“江上的雪”——它来自一首九世纪的诗，描写了一个渔夫在落雪的江上独自驾舟。这是中国诗歌中最令人难忘的形象之一，暗示着一个人在逆境中坚持不懈，孤独地追求着许多人可能无法理解的东西。

This time it was around the Dragon Boat Festival, a particularly apt holiday because it is rooted in the story of a famous poet from antiquity who committed suicide to protest government misrule.But we can also see an endless cycle of creation, of new sparks that leap off the flint of history every time it is struck.
那次是在端午节前后，这个节日特别应景，因为它起源于古代一位著名诗人自杀抗议朝政败坏的故事。但我们仍可以看到创作的无限循环，新的星火就在历史燧石的每一次敲击中不断迸发出来。

Right on Sabina Shoal, where delicate coral once thrived, we saw boats arranged in a defensive formation. Ropes tied some of the vessels together. Chinese flags flew. Men bantered over the radio in a southern Chinese dialect. No fishing nets were in evidence.We could see empty Chinese instant noodle packets floating in the water. They have steel hulls and advanced satellites, and some have rammed smaller Southeast Asian fishing boats. 
萨比纳浅滩曾是脆弱的珊瑚繁衍生息的地方，我们在那里看到了形成防御队形的船只。绳索将一些船只绑在一起。船上悬挂着中国国旗。用无线电通话的男子们开玩笑用的是中国南方方言。没有看到渔网。我们在水面上能看到漂浮的中国方便面包装袋。它们的船体是钢制的，配备了先进的卫星设备，一些船还撞击过比它们小的东南亚渔船。

Hundreds of workers at a factory in Shenyang in northeastern China weld automated machines, 95 yards long, that are used to bore subway tunnels. Shenyang is the capital of Liaoning Province, one of three large provinces in the northeast that constitute the cradle of China’s heavy industry. Northeastern China is like the Michigan and Ohio of Chinese manufacturing, but with a population considerably grayer than Florida’s. In many ways, the region is a composite of the most deeply embedded problems facing the country’s economy.
在中国东北沈阳的一家工厂里，数以百计的工人正在焊接用于开挖地铁隧道的自动化机器，这些机器长约85米。沈阳是辽宁省的省会，辽宁在内所在的东北三省是中国重工业的摇篮。东北就像中国制造业版的密歇根州和俄亥俄州，但人口老龄化程度比佛罗里达州高得多。许多方面看，这里综合体现了中国经济面临的最深层问题。

The region holds strategic importance. It encompasses sensitive regions abutting North Korea and Russia. It is home to much of China’s armaments industry, first built with Soviet advisers in the 1950s. What’s missing from it are measures that could boost consumer confidence, 
该地区具有重要的战略意义。它包括与朝鲜和俄罗斯接壤的敏感地区。这里是中国大部分武器工业的基地，最初是在20世纪50年代与苏联顾问一起建造的。它缺少的是能够提振消费者信心的措施，

If the U.N. Charter, which outlawed the wars of aggression, is overturned, then only nuclear powers will be able to settle disputes according to their dictates. It will be ‘might is right’ again.
如果禁止侵略战争的《联合国宪章》被推翻的话，那么只有有核国家才能按照自己的意愿解决争端。‘强权即公理’将再现。

Today the backward homeland of my childhood has become the world’s second-largest economy,Yet so much of the world is still asking the same questions and still comparing China to former Communist countries with their autocratic and repressive regimes.In interviews, I like to talk about what has not been said,I like to balance out the conversation a little bit, rather than join the chorus — show that there’s also another side.
如今，我童年时落后的祖国已成为世界第二大经济体，然而，世界上很多地方仍在问同样的问题，仍在将中国与那些前共产党国家的专制和压迫政权相比较。我愿意在采访中谈论人们缄口不言之事，我喜欢平衡一下对话，而不是人云亦云，来证明另一面的存在。

A Chinese person always has to make that balance between individualism and deference to authority, to a certain degree. It’s not black and white, it’s gray.I’m not trying to make any excuses for any of these things. I just see, from an economist’s point of view, the welfare of hundreds of millions of people, and the changing circumstances. There are improvements in certain areas and regressions in certain other areas.
在某种程度上，任何中国人都得在个人主义和服从权威之间找到平衡。这不是非黑即白的，而是一种灰色地带。我不是在为这样的事找借口。我只是从经济学家的角度看到了无数人的福祉和不断变化的环境。在某些领域有所改善，而在另外一些领域则有所倒退。

I personally prefer to rise above the emotions and look at the facts, the truths, the data, and hopefully contribute where I think there are blind spots or gaps in understanding. Being too submerged in emotional attitudes, which is true of both countries, is not going to help make this world a better place.I think it’s a tussle but not a break. It’s more a war of words, and a slow structural decline in economic engagement, whether in terms of trade or mutual investment.American businesses will have to ask themselves whether they want to forsake the largest market in the world. 
我个人更愿意抛开主观感情，关注事实、真相和数据，并希望在我认为存在盲点或误解的地方做出贡献。两国都太过意气用事，这无助于让世界变得更好。我认为目前的状态是一种拉锯而非关系破裂。这更像是一场口水战，以及经济交往的整体缓慢下降，无论是在贸易还是相互投资方面。美国企业将不得不扪心自问，是否真愿意放弃这个世界上最大的市场。

If global warming continues unabated, biologists fear it will lead to the extinction of a number of species, while people will be unable to survive the heat and humidity in large swaths of the planet.On Pangea Ultima, Dr. Farnsworth and his colleagues concluded, things will probably get far worse for mammals like us. Dr. Farnsworth granted that a few mammals might eke out an existence in refuges on the fringes of Pangea Ultima. They might be replaced by coldblooded reptiles that could tolerate the heat.
生物学家担心，如果全球变暖持续下去，将导致许多物种灭绝，而人类将无法在地球大片地区的炎热和潮湿中生存。法恩斯沃斯和他的同事得出结论是，在终极盘古大陆，对于像我们这样的哺乳动物来说，情况可能会变得更糟。法恩斯沃斯认为，少数哺乳动物可能会在终极盘古大陆边缘的避难地勉强生存。取而代之的可能是耐热的冷血爬行动物。
