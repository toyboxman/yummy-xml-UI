The values of liberal democracy — which emphasize individual rights and freedoms for all people — are enshrined by the United Nations and were celebrated as truths we hold “to be self-evident,” in the words of the American Declaration of Independence. In other words, so widely accepted as to require no proof.But are they really? The question is taking on more importance now, as liberal democracy, especially in the United States, which is seen globally as a model, seems to be degrading into fierce polarization over cultural, religious and racial questions.
自由民主的价值观——强调所有人的个人权利和自由——被联合国奉为圭臬，用美国《独立宣言》的话来说，它被视为“不言而喻”的真理。换句话说，它被广泛接受，以至于无需证明。但真的是这样吗？这个问题现在变得更加重要，因为自由民主似乎在文化、宗教和种族问题上正堕入激烈的两极分化，尤其是在被全球视为典范的美国。

In reaction, Lee Kuan Yew, who served as the founding prime minister of Singapore from 1959 to 1990, argued against the idea of universal values, asserting that Asian or “Confucian” values emphasized family and community more than individual rights and were just as valid. His argument was seen by some as a way to justify what was widely viewed as Singapore’s paternalistic and heavy-handed government. But it was also a response to what many saw as Western cultural imperialism, an extension of the older missionary effort to convert the world to Christianity.
作为回应，在1959年至1990年期间担任新加坡开国总理的李光耀反对普世价值的理念，声称亚洲或“儒家”价值观同样有效，这种价值观更强调家庭和社区，而不是个人权利。在一些人看来，他的观点是在为人们普遍视为的新加坡家长式作风和高压政府辩护。但这也是对许多人眼中的西方文化帝国主义的回应，这种文化帝国主义是老一辈传教士努力使世界皈依基督教的延伸。

The Chinese and prominent Asian intellectuals like Kishore Mahbubani of Singapore have regularly accused their critics of using human rights as a kind of cudgel, pretending to be arguing for freedom and universal values while in reality pursuing their own political and economic agendas.That is an argument now more widely shared in the Global South, which is heterogeneous but wants the current, post-World War II, Western-dominated multilateral global order to be replaced by a more diverse, open system — one that recognizes that the world has changed and new powers have risen.
中国人和像新加坡的马凯硕这样的知名亚洲知识分子经常指责他们的批评者把人权问题当武器，假装在论证自由和普世价值，实际上却是在运作他们自己的政治和经济议程。这一看法目前在全球南方得到了更多支持。虽然并非铁板一块，但全球南方认为应该摒弃当下由西方主导的二战后多边全球秩序，转向一个更多元、开放的系统——这个系统要承认世界已经改变，新的势力已经崛起。

As a result, political leaders in many places feel emboldened to assert their own interests, believing the benefits of aggressive action may outweigh the costs. These leaders believe that they have more sway over their own region than the U.S. does.A fully multipolar world has emerged, and people are belatedly realizing that multipolarity involves quite a bit of chaos
因此，许多地方的政治领导人认为，采取激进行动的好处可能大于成本，因此敢于维护自身利益。这些领导人认为，他们在自己所在的地区拥有比美国更大的影响力。一个完全多极的世界已经出现，人们迟迟才意识到，多极化包含着相当多的混乱

Zheng Yongnian, a Chinese political scientist with ties to the country’s leaders, has similarly described the “old order” as disintegrating. “Countries are brimming with ambition, like tigers eyeing their prey, keen to find every opportunity among the ruins of the old order,” 
与中国领导人有联系的中国政治学家郑永年也同样认为“旧的秩序”正在瓦解。“各国野心勃勃，虎视眈眈，希冀在旧秩序的废墟上寻找一切机会，”

The most sweeping invasion of Israeli territory in decades, conducted by a Hamas force that had been widely seen as a ragtag collection of militants, has delivered a psychological shock to Israel so great that its very foundations are being questioned.The war that began with a Hamas assault that has taken as many as 700 Israeli lives is not an existential struggle for the survival of the Israeli state itself, as were the 1948 war triggered by Israel’s foundation or the 1973 Yom Kippur War. 
一支被普遍认为由各种武装分子混杂而成的哈马斯武装对以色列领土发起了几十年来最大规模的侵略，给后者带来极大的心理冲击，以至于令人对其国家根基产生质疑.这场因哈马斯的袭击而起的战争已经导致700名以色列人丧生，但与1948年因色列建国引发的战争或1973年赎罪日战争不同，它并非是一场关乎以色列国家存亡的斗争。

As with the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War, disbelief has mingled with anger at a colossal intelligence failure.In 1973, the assumption was that after Israel’s lightning victory in the 1967 Six-Day War, Syria and Egypt were spent forces. Today, the belief had grown that Hamas was uninterested in large-scale violence and that it could even be a useful vehicle for weakening the more moderate Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, thus burying talk of a Palestinian state.
和赎罪日战争爆发时一样，如此重大的情报失败令人在愤怒中还夹杂着难以置信。1973年时，人们认为在1967年以色列以迅雷之势取得六日战争胜利后，叙利亚和埃及已经是强弩之末。在今天，人们渐渐开始相信哈马斯对大规模的暴力已经失去兴趣，甚至可以利用它去削弱约旦河西岸相对温和的巴勒斯坦民族权力机构，从而打消巴勒斯坦建国的可能性。

The conflict became “the situation,” a bland term expressing a combustible status quo. Mr. Netanyahu emerged as the champion of a kick-the-can-down-the-road approach that left the two-state idea on life support. Israel normalized relations with several smaller Arab states. The Palestinian issue all but disappeared from the global agenda. There was talk of a new Middle East.All this, however, could not hide the elephant in the room: the growing Palestinian fury at humiliation and marginalization that had already led to a spike in West Bank violence this year.
冲突变成了“状况”，用这样一个平淡的词来表达一种会爆发的现状。内塔尼亚胡成了拖延方案的倡导者，两国方案已经名存实亡。以色列与多个较小的阿拉伯国家实现关系正常化。巴勒斯坦问题几乎已经从全球议题中消失。人们开始谈论一个全新的中东。然而这一切都无法掩盖房间里那只大象：被欺辱和边缘化的巴勒斯坦人的愤怒与日俱增，今年已经出现暴力事件增加的迹象。

In a recorded message, Muhammad Deif, the leader of Hamas’s military wing, described the objective of the “operation” as ensuring that “the enemy will understand that the time of their rampaging without accountability has ended.” The temptation is clearly strong for an overwhelming Israeli offensive to make sure Hamas is never again able to mount such an operation. Issues of international law are certain to arise, around proportionality and collateral damage
哈马斯军事机构领导人穆罕默德·德伊夫通过预先录制的视频表示，此次“行动”的目标是确保“敌人能明白，他们肆意横行的日子已经过去”,用一场压倒性的进攻让哈马斯再也不能发起类似的行动显然是一个很有吸引力的目标。不成比例的、附带性的损害会促使人们提起国际法问题

In many ways, the challenges with the search underscored the weakened state of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia.It had been nearly 300 years since the title of Bogd belonged to a Mongolian. After the Mongols submitted to the Chinese Qing Empire in the late 17th century, the emperor ruled that all future reincarnations of the Bogd were to be found in Tibet, to prevent a Mongol uprising.In the late 18th century, Emperor Qianlong of China tried to address this by drawing lots from a golden urn to select lamas. 
从许多方面来看，寻找转世灵童的挑战凸显了藏传佛教在蒙古的衰弱状况。上一次由蒙古人获得博克多的称号已经是近300年前的事情了。17世纪末，蒙古人臣服于大清帝国后，清朝皇帝规定必须在西藏寻找未来所有的博克多转世，以防蒙古人造反。在18世纪晚期，中国的乾隆皇帝试图通过金瓶抽签来选择喇嘛，从而解决这个问题。

Mongolia relies on China to buy its exports and invest in its infrastructure. China’s imprint is on display in Ulaanbaatar, in a snaking four-lane overpass designed to ease the city’s punishing traffic, and a sports arena embossed with a logo that reads: “China Aid For Shared Future.”
蒙古依赖中国购买其出口产品并投资基础设施。中国的印记在乌兰巴托展露无遗，包括一处旨在缓解城市交通拥堵的错综复杂的四车道立交桥，以及一座体育馆，该场馆的标识上题有“中国援助共享未来“的字样。

If China fails to order the banks to write off bad loans in the property market, interest costs will continue to chip away at the economy, while too much capital will continue to be wasted on investments with no value.China’s banking system, holding four-fifths of the country’s financial assets including most of the bonds, is far too big for the government to let fail.
如果中国不能命令银行冲销房地产市场的不良贷款，利息成本将继续侵蚀经济，而过多的资本将继续浪费在没有价值的投资上。中国的银行系统持有全国五分之四的金融资产，包括大部分债券，其规模太大，政府无法任其倒闭。

In addition, China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, has conducted an elaborate stress test on the balance sheets of China’s 20 largest commercial banks, said three of the people, to ensure their resilience in case of further real estate losses.Banks, real estate developers and local governments are all hoping that Beijing will eventually help them. But the national government has shown scant enthusiasm so far.
此外，其中三位知情人士表示，中国央行中国人民银行对中国20家最大商业银行的资产负债表进行了详尽的压力测试，以确保它们在房地产进一步损失的情况下具有抵御风险的能力。银行、房地产开发商和地方政府都希望北京最终会出手相助。但到目前为止，中央政府并没有表现出多少热情。

Legend Zhu was the conventional ideal of Chinese beauty. Tall with shoulder-length hair, she led her university’s modeling team, whose members were often called upon to strut down runways at campus fashion shows wearing body-hugging dresses and dramatic eye makeup.Over the summer, she took to Xiaohongshu, a Chinese social media platform known for its lifestyle influencers, to post a selfie with buzz-cut hair and a cosmetic-free face.
莱金德·朱是传统意义上的中国美女。身材高挑、长发齐肩的她是大学模特队的领队，这些模特经常被要求穿着紧身裙装，化着夸张的眼妆，在校园时装秀的T台上走秀。今年夏天，她在以生活方式网红而闻名的中国社交媒体平台“小红书”上发了一张超短发素颜自拍照。

When Annie Xie, a woman in the northern city of Qinhuangdao, was in middle school, she began wearing makeup and colored contact lenses and dieted to fit into size 0 dresses.At 15, she was hospitalized for anorexia nervosa. That was when she started to look inward and was inspired by a classic of feminism, “The Second Sex” by Simone de Beauvoir. Reading its famous sentence “One is not born, but becomes a woman,” she said, felt “like a lightning strike.”
北方城市秦皇岛的安妮·谢从中学时期就开始化妆戴美瞳，并为了穿上最小号的裙子节食。15岁那年，她因神经性厌食症入院接受治疗。那之后，她开始审视内心，并大受西蒙娜·德·波伏娃的女性主义经典著作《第二性》的启发。“女人不是生来就是女人，而是被后天塑造成女人的，”她说看完感觉“像被雷击中了一样”。

Then I saw the legs of a bloated corpse dressed in fatigues poking out from under a bush, and beside it a khaki vest with the insignia of a commando unit of Hamas, the group that controls the Palestinian coastal enclave, and staged Saturday’s assault on Israel.Past the village dining hall, kindergarten and culture center, the tidy rows of one-story beige houses came into view. And the scale of the horror began to unfold.
然后，我看到一具穿着迷彩服的臃肿尸体，腿从灌木丛中伸出来，旁边是一件卡其色背心，上面印着哈马斯突击队的徽章。哈马斯控制着巴勒斯坦的沿海飞地，并策划了周六对以色列的袭击。经过村里的食堂、幼儿园和文化中心，一排排整齐的米黄色平房映入眼帘。恐怖的严重程度开始显现。

They moved slowly, house to house, for fear that Hamas gunmen could still be hiding inside or have booby-trapped them. Live grenades lay in wait, to be neutralized by sappers. They carried out one slain resident in a body bag on a stretcher and placed it in the back of a truck. Then another. And another.After days of stunned national numbness and chaos, the dimensions of the atrocity that took place here were now coming into clear focus. 
由于担心哈马斯武装分子可能依然躲在屋内，或者在屋内设置了诱杀装置，他们挨家挨户缓慢移动。未爆炸的榴弹有待工兵销毁。他们用担架把一名遇害居民装在尸袋里抬出来，放在卡车的后面。然后是又一具尸体。又一具。整个国家经历了数天的震惊、麻木和混乱之后，这里暴行的严重程度现在变得清晰起来。

Kfar Azza, a kibbutz, or communal village, was founded in 1951, three years after the establishment of the State of Israel. The early settlers were long considered the pioneering, salt-of-the-earth socialist elite of the country. Like those who live in most other kibbutz communities, the residents are generally left-leaning liberals.More recently, as Israel shifted to the right, the kibbutzniks, as they are known, have been dismissed by supporters of the ultranationalist government as privileged snobs, or worse, as traitors.
卡法阿扎是一个集体农庄，成立于1951年，也就是以色列建国三年后。长期以来，早期定居者被认为是开拓者，是这个国家社会主义精英中的中坚分子。和大多数其他基布兹社区的居民一样，这里的居民一般都是左倾的自由主义者。最近，随着以色列转向右翼，这些被称为“基布兹”的人被极端民族主义政府的支持者斥为享有特权的势利小人，或者更糟的是，被斥为叛徒。

The white ceiling was pockmarked with holes from bullets and shrapnel, like a macabre negative of a starry night sky. The house had been ransacked, but a richly colored spice rack remained intact. Other houses had been burned, their interiors entirely charred.“I really don’t know where our state was,” she said, echoing the anger and bewilderment of many Israelis over how the country, with its vaunted military and intelligence capabilities, could have been caught so off-guard and unprepared.
白色的天花板上布满了弹孔和弹片，就像星夜照片的底片，令人毛骨悚然。房子被洗劫过，但一个色彩斑斓的调料架完好无损。其他房屋也被烧毁，内部完全烧焦。“我确实不知道我们的国家在哪里，”她说，这与许多以色列人的愤怒和困惑一样，他们不明白，这个拥有引以为荣的军事和情报能力的国家，怎么会如此措手不及、毫无准备。

Now that the post-Cold War has expired, the post-post-Cold War that we’ve entered is just begging to be named. So here goes: It’s the age of “That Was Not the Plan.”I know, I know, that doesn’t trip off the tongue — and I don’t expect it to stick — but boy is it accurate. I stumbled across it on a recent trip to Ukraine.
现在后冷战时代已经终结，我们正在进入后后冷战，急需给它取个名字。那我来吧：这是一个“本来没打算这样”的时代。我知道，我知道这不怎么顺口——我也不指望它能流传开来——但是这描述实在太到位了。我是在近日去乌克兰的时候突然想到的。

But if we have three more years of this extremist Netanyahu government, with its aspiration to annex the West Bank and govern Palestinians there with an apartheidlike system, the Jewish state could become a major source of instability in the region, not stability, and a much more uncertain ally — more like Turkey and less like the Israel of old.
但是，这个极端的内塔尼亚胡政府渴望吞并约旦河西岸，并以类似种族隔离的制度治理那里的巴勒斯坦人，这个政府再执政三年，以色列可能会成为该地区不稳定——而不是稳定——的主要根源，成为一个更不确定的盟友——更像土耳其，而不像过去的以色列。

Because America is still the tent pole that holds up the world. We don’t always do it with wisdom, but if we were to stop doing it at all — watch out. Given what’s already going on in these other three important countries, if we go wobbly, it will birth a world where nobody will be able to make any plans.
因为美国仍然是世界的支柱。我们在支撑世界的时候不见得总是有智慧，但如果我们完全停止这样做——那就要小心了。考虑到其它三个重要国家已经发生的情况，如果我们摇摆不定，就会产生一个没有人能够制定任何计划的世界。

I’m highly skeptical of the pipeline’s commercial logic, but energy security and geopolitics might ultimately trump economics,Some of the oil that China buys is being put in storage tanks, which it is building at an even faster rate than its oil consumption has risen. 
我对这条管道的商业逻辑持高度怀疑态度，但能源安全和地缘政治最终可能胜过经济，中国购买的一些石油正被储存在储油罐中，储油罐的建造速度甚至快于其石油消费的增长速度。

To understand today’s penny-pinching Chinese consumers, behold the vicious price war playing out among the country’s coffee store giants.Luckin Coffee, a popular Chinese chain, rose to prominence and opened 10,800 stores by successfully undercutting Starbucks’s prices. 
想知道如今的中国消费者是如何精打细算的，不妨看看该国咖啡店巨头之间愈演愈烈的价格战。瑞幸咖啡是一家人气颇高的中国连锁品牌，以价格优势打败星巴克而声名鹊起，目前它已开设了10800家门店。

The jostling over coffee prices captures an emerging trend among Chinese consumers who are spending less and saving more to counteract the impact of a slumping economy plagued by a real estate sector in crisis and falling exports.The shift to thrift is a worrying sign for China’s leaders, who need people to spend more. To stimulate growth, policymakers are banking on an increase in domestic consumption as an alternative to the boom-or-bust cycle of infrastructure spending and real estate investment that has left local governments and developers awash in debt.
咖啡价格战反映了中国消费者中的一股新趋势，为了应对由房地产行业危机和出口下降所导致的经济低迷，他们正在减少支出、增加储蓄。对需要民众增加消费的中国领导层来说，这种节俭趋势是一个令人担忧的信号。为了刺激经济增长，政策制定者寄希望于国内消费增长，以此来替代基础设施支出和房地产投资，后两者的兴衰周期已让地方政府和开发商债台高筑。

Instead of buying coffee at Starbucks, Ms. Chen said, she chooses between Luckin and Cotti based on “whichever is cheaper.” She used to use an expensive Japanese skin toner, but she switched to a Chinese brand that is 90 percent cheaper. She also stopped shopping at Victoria’s Secret for bras and underwear, choosing a no-name brand that costs $3 each.Some Chinese businesses see an opportunity in the new frugal ways of consumers.
陈曦曦说她不再购买星巴克的咖啡，而是根据“谁便宜我就喝谁”的原则在瑞幸和库迪之间做出选择。她以前总使用昂贵的日本爽肤水，但现在改用价格便宜了90%的中国品牌。她也不再去“维多利亚的秘密”购买胸罩和内衣，而是选择每件售价约20元的不知名品牌。一些中国企业在新的降级消费潮中看到了机遇。

For China, the status quo suits its interests. The stabilization of the frontline in Ukraine means that Beijing does not need to dramatically intervene on Russia’s side to prevent a military defeat that could shake Putin’s grip on power. And the drawn-out, inconclusive war leaves Russia economically and diplomatically dependent on China, and too distracted to counter Beijing in areas where their geopolitical interests overlap, such as Central Asia.
对中国来说，现状符合其自身利益。乌克兰前线的稳定状况意味着北京无需对俄方进行强烈干预，以防俄罗斯战败，进而动摇普京的权力。这场越拖越久、充满不确定性的战争也让俄罗斯在经济和外交方面均依赖中国，并让俄罗斯无暇分身，无法在中俄两国地缘政治利益重叠的地区（例如中亚）与北京抗衡。

Greece is a prime example of the mixed success of the American lobbying campaign. It has not prohibited Huawei’s products outright, and the company has battled to keep its hard-won hold in the country.Huawei views the U.S. actions as an existential threat, Huawei’s technology had a limited presence in the country’s new telecom networks.
希腊是美国游说努力成败参半的典型例子。希腊一直没有绝对禁止华为的产品，华为则一直在努力保住公司在希腊来之不易的地位。华为将美国的行动视为生存威胁,华为技术在希腊的新电信网络中的应用有限。

The story is how Huawei is navigating the European landscape to try to maintain the position they have, They are playing all the cards they can play.In 2020, Greece joined the Clean Networks initiative, a voluntary and nonbinding agreement to avoid using technology from authoritarian governments, which the Trump administration spearheaded. 
这个故事讲的是华为如何在欧洲审时度势，试图维持其现有地位，他们正在打他们所有能打的牌。2020年，希腊加入了“净网”倡议，这是个自愿且不具约束力的协议，加入者被要求避免使用来自威权政府的技术，该倡议由特朗普政府带头发起。

“Greece has on paper a very solid anti-corruption and anti-bribery framework,” he said. But transparency is almost nonexistent, he added, and enforcement of the laws is “very problematic.” Microsoft’s warning did not go unheeded. 
“希腊在纸面上有非常坚实的反腐败、反贿赂框架，”他说。但又补充道，透明度几乎不存在，法律的执行“非常有问题”。微软的警告并未石沉大海。

The operations could place “enormous stress” on the grid if the mines worked in concert to wreak havoc. Possibilities include targeted blackouts and cyberattacks. Across the United States, the identities of the Chinese mines’ owners are often hidden in a maze of shell companies that are themselves owned by shell companies. The mines can “magnify the severity of grid events,” impacting reliability
如果这些矿场协同工作，造成严重破坏，这些行动可能会给电网带来“巨大压力”。可能性包括有针对性的停电和网络攻击。在美国各地，中国矿主的身份往往隐藏在一堆空壳公司之中，而这些空壳公司本身又由空壳公司拥有。这些矿场会“放大电网事件的严重性”，影响可靠性。

The journal’s brief run — the group published only two issues — would cost several of its founders their lives but it was also real proof of something the fictional Smith never lived to see: an alliance of truth-seekers who were capable, however briefly, of making something larger than themselves.
该杂志存在的时间很短，只出版了两期，但其中几位创办人为此付出了生命的代价，它以事实证明了虚构人物史密斯从未见识过的事情：不管成果多么短暂，一个探求真相者的联盟可以创作出比他们本身更不朽的东西。

Wages also tend to be lower in China. Autoworkers in big cities like Shanghai earn about $30,000 a year in pay and benefits, while workers in less expensive cities in the interior earn considerably less. By contrast, Ford Motor has said its workers earned an average of $110,000 a year in pay and benefits. The U.A.W. is seeking a roughly 40 percent pay raise over four years, plus a paid day off each workweek.
中国的薪资往往也较低。在上海这样的大城市，汽车工人一年的薪水加津贴大约在30000美元，而内陆地区物价水平更低的城市薪水还要低很多。相比之下，福特汽车称其工人一年的薪水加津贴达到平均110000美元。汽车工人联合会目前在寻求四年内涨薪约40%，另外每周增加一天的带薪休假。

It’s sad that the date of her birthday, and even the exact hour we were planning to do something for her, is turning into the hour of the funeral. We have woken to a terrible sobriety about whose hands we put our fate in. But several American officials have noted that the reservists called back into service by Israel largely have little training in urban warfare and are likely to shoot at anything that moves. Mr. Trump initially praised Hezbollah as “very smart” after the massacre.
让人难过的是，她的生日，甚至是那些我们本来计划为她做点什么的时候，都变成了敲响的丧钟。我们在惊骇中醒觉，才知道我们都把自己的安危交在了什么人手上.但几名美国官员指出，被以色列召回服役的预备役军人大多没有接受过巷战训练，很可能会向任何移动的东西开枪。大屠杀发生后，特朗普最初曾称赞真主党“非常聪明”。

“The citizens are relying on us to defeat Hamas and remove the threat from Gaza once and for all.” That caught my ear because, over the years, I’ve learned that four of the most dangerous words in the Middle East are “once and for all.”
“国民指望我们击败哈马斯，一劳永逸地解除来自加沙的威胁。”我之所以会注意，因为多年来，我了解到，在中东地区，最危险的四个字就是“一劳永逸”。

China’s economy, the world’s second largest, has struggled since the spring, as housing sales slowed and some of the biggest developers faced insolvency. The country’s debt load, which has surged in the past 15 years, continues to weigh on growth.
作为全球第二大经济体，中国经济自今年春季以来一直举步维艰，住房销售放缓，一些最大的开发商面临破产。该国的债务负担在过去15年里激增，继续拖累经济增长。

The upshot is that China’s ability to reach the technological frontier in the development of large-scale A.I. models will be hampered by U.S. export controls
结果是，中国在开发大规模人工智能模型方面达到技术前沿的能力将受到美国出口管制的阻碍

As President Biden lands in Israel on Wednesday seeking to display undying American support for the country in the midst of an intensifying crisis after a deadly explosion at a hospital in the Gaza Strip
美国总统拜登周三抵达以色列、寻求展示美国对以色列的永恒支持之际，加沙地带的危机正在不断加剧，此前，当地一家医院发生了致命爆炸事件。

When it comes to the Middle East, there is perhaps no region where the through-the-looking glass nature of these competing views is more apparent.For Mr. Putin, the war has presented another opportunity for gloating, as he blames Washington for the conflict. 
也许没有哪个地区能比中东更明显地体现出这些对立观点的超现实本质。加沙冲突给普京提供了又一个幸灾乐祸的机会，他已将这场冲突归咎于华盛顿。

the United States fights Russia, the occupier of Ukraine, but when it comes to Israel, the U.S. is on the side of the occupier, and Russia taps into that.If normalization gets derailed, that would be another side benefit from Moscow’s point of view.
美国反对乌克兰的占领者俄罗斯，但在以色列问题上，美国却站在占领者一边。俄罗斯正在利用这一点。如果沙特与以色列关系正常化受阻，从莫斯科的角度来看，那将是另一个额外的好处。

When presidents get into their sweet spot you usually see and hear it, and in the past few weeks you have seen and heard it,He seems determined to prove that for all the critiques that the United States is a divided, declining power, it remains the only nation that can mold events in a world of unpredictable mayhem.
进入最佳状态的总统往往都锋芒毕露，过去几周大家都看到也听到了，哪怕无数批评都在说美国是一个分裂的、正在衰落的大国，但他似乎誓要证明美国仍是唯一一个能在不可预测的混乱世界中决定历史走向的国家。

In a sign of China’s deepening property crisis, Country Garden, once the country’s biggest home builder, is scrambling to stave off collapse amid a sharp downturn in sales. For the last few months, it has been unloading assets and selling shares to raise money to meet its significant debt obligations.
在楼市急剧下滑之际，碧桂园作为曾经中国最大的住宅建筑商正在竭力避免破产，反映出中国房地产危机的日益加深。过去几个月，该公司一直在抛售资产股票，筹集资金偿还巨额债务。

A default by Country Garden, once considered a model of fiscal responsibility in a Chinese property industry awash with reckless borrowing, would underscore the depth and scope of China’s real estate crisis. 
在中国充斥着肆意借贷的房地产行业，碧桂园曾被认为是履行财务责任的典范，该公司的违约凸显了中国房地产危机的深重程度。

In late July, as Country Garden’s financial problems deepened, Ms. Yang donated roughly $800 million worth of stock in the company’s services subsidiary to a family charity run by her sister. The Hong Kong-based charity works on a wide range of causes including supporting science, education and culture as well as promoting rural revitalization in mainland China. A property developer’s services arm to support existing homeowners often remains profitable even if demand for new homes dries up.
7月下旬，随着碧桂园财务问题加重，杨惠妍将服务部门子公司价值近59亿元的股票捐赠给了她妹妹经营的家族慈善机构。这家慈善机构总部在香港，业务十分广泛，包括支持科学、教育、文化以及促进中国大陆的乡村振兴事业。即便新房需求枯竭，由购房业主掏钱支撑的地产服务部门往往仍能盈利。

Beijing has long bristled at the U.S. military aircraft and ships that operate in international skies and seas near China.a Chinese fighter jet that sped toward a U.S. military plane, dipped under its nose and later came as close as 10 feet underneath it; a Chinese plane that flew within 20 feet of the nose of a U.S. plane, which took evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision; and a Chinese fighter jet that fired eight flares while only 900 feet from a U.S. plane.
长期以来，北京一直对美国军机和军舰在中国附近的国际空域和海域活动感到愤怒。一架中国战斗机快速冲向一架美国军用飞机，俯冲到其机头下方，后来接近其下方三米；一架中国飞机飞到距离一架美国飞机机头不到六米的地方，美国飞机采取了规避动作以避免相撞；一架中国战斗机在距离一架美国飞机仅270米的地方发射了八枚照明弹。

The most eye-catching evidence of China’s nuclear buildup in recent years has been three clusters of missile silos that have been dug out of the deserts of northern China. China “may be exploring development” of conventionally armed intercontinental missiles. 
近年来，中国核建设最引人注目的证据是在中国北方沙漠中挖掘的三个导弹发射井群。中国“可能正在探索发展”常规洲际导弹。

On a sweltering June morning, the new international terminal at the airport in Pokhara, Nepal’s second-biggest city, roared to life with the arrival of a Sichuan Airlines flight from China.A water cannon showered the plane
6月的一个闷热的上午，尼泊尔第二大城市博克拉的机场迎来一架中国四川航空的航班，令这座新建的航站楼热闹了起来。这架空客A319飞机接受了水门礼。

These maiden arrivals were athletes and Chinese officials who had come for a good-will dragon boat race. Their flight had been chartered and funded by Beijing.China and Nepal signed a 20-year agreement in 2016; a quarter of the money would be an interest-free loan. 
此次处女航搭载的是前来参加一场亲善龙舟赛的运动员和中国官员。包机费用由北京承担。中国和尼泊尔在2016年签署了一份20年的协议；其中四分之一的资金将是免息贷款

The initial construction budget had earmarked $2.8 million for Nepal to hire consultants to make sure CAMC was abiding by international construction standards, according to documents. CAMC completed earth-filling work for the 8,200-foot runway, but it had no documentation that it had tested the soil density. Without proper soil density, the runway could become bumpy or littered with cracks and potholes in the future.
文件显示，最初的建设预算曾预留了280万美元，用于尼泊尔聘请顾问，以确保中工国际遵守国际建筑标准。中工国际当时已完成了2500米跑道的填土工作，但公司没有测试过土壤密度的文件记录。如果土壤密度不合适的话，跑道在未来可能会变得凸凹不平或布满了裂缝和坑洼。

The local headlines that day, however, were about a tweet from the Chinese Embassy in Nepal declaring Pokhara airport “the flagship project” of China and Nepal’s Belt and Road Initiative cooperation, even though work on the airport predated China’s infrastructure program.
当地当天的头条新闻是中国驻尼泊尔大使馆发推文称，博克拉机场是“中尼共建‘一带一路’的一张亮丽名片”，尽管机场的建设早于“一带一路”倡议。

The missile has dissolved like salt in the water,It’s vaporized. Nothing is left. Who says we’re obligated to present the remnants of every rocket that kills our people? In general, you can come and research and confirm for yourself from the evidence we possess.We have made mistakes, I am not going to deny it,However, not mistakes of this size.
导弹就像盐溶解在水里一样，它彻底消失了。什么也没有留下. 谁说我们有义务拿出每一枚杀死我们人民的火箭弹的残余物？反正你们可以自行前来研究和确认我们掌握的证据。我不否认我们曾犯过错误，但可没犯过这么大的错误。

But to Israelis, the accusation that Israel hit the hospital is part of a grand deception aimed at undermining the legitimacy of Israel’s response to what officials say was the deadliest single attack on Jews since the Holocaust.
但对以色列人来说，指控以色列袭击医院是一场巨大骗局的一环，目的是动摇以色列反击这场袭击的合法性，官员称这是自“纳粹大屠杀”以来犹太人遭受的最致命的袭击。

But the Biden administration has backed Israel, with officials saying that multiple strands of early intelligence, including infrared satellite data, show a launch of a rocket or missile from Palestinian fighter positions within Gaza.
但是拜登政府已经在支持以色列的说法，有官员说初步情报给出的多个线索，包括红外卫星数据，显示在加沙境内的巴勒斯坦武装人员发射了一枚火箭或导弹

Reporters and photographers who toured the site that day found a shallow dent in the ground, but no deep crater of the kind usually caused by an Israeli precision-guided missile used in an airstrike.
查看了现场的记者和摄影师发现地上有一个浅坑，但没有以色列在空袭中使用的精确制导导弹通常会留下的那种很深的弹坑。

Americans didn’t always have an appetite for squid.As recently as 1970, U.S. fishermen caught squid mostly by mistake, and when they did, they either tossed it back or used it as bait. By 1990, however, the invertebrate — now masquerading as calamari — had become a restaurant staple, appearing in the appetizer lane of menus across America alongside Buffalo wings and loaded potato skins.
美国人并不是从一开始就喜欢吃鱿鱼的。就在距今不远的1970年，美国渔民捕获鱿鱼大多是误捕，如果捉到了，要么把它扔回去，要么把它当作鱼饵。然而，到1990年，这种无脊椎动物——现在成了炸鱿鱼圈——已经成为餐馆的菜肴，与布法罗鸡翅和填馅土豆皮一起，出现在美国各地菜单的开胃菜栏。

Collectively, they began a rebranding campaign designed to persuade Americans to eat more of the ubiquitous, eight-armed mollusk — no small task, given that most people considered the creature to be slimy and generally off-putting.
他们共同发起了一场重塑品牌的运动，旨在说服美国人多吃这种无处不在的八肢软体动物——这可不是一项小任务，因为大多数人认为这种生物黏糊糊的，往往令人讨厌。

That all changed in 1974, when a business school student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology named Paul Kalikstein came up with an idea. American consumers would probably get over squid’s texture if, as with onion rings, chefs breaded and fried it. Other experts also argued that restaurateurs should start referring to squid as calamari, from words for the animal in several Romance languages, which sounded more exotic. Restaurants tried it, and it worked: Americans started to order calamari.
1974年，麻省理工学院商学院学生保罗·卡利克斯坦提出了一个想法，从而改变了一切。如果厨师能像制作洋葱圈一样，给鱿鱼裹上面包屑油炸，美国消费者可能就会接受鱿鱼的口感了。其他专家还认为，餐馆老板应该用“calamari”（炸鱿鱼圈）来称呼鱿鱼，这个词来自几种罗曼语，听起来更有异国情调。餐馆尝试了这种做法，效果很好：美国人开始点鱿鱼了。

It makes sense for humans to eat squid. Environmentally minded chefs like it because it is one of the lowest carbon-emitting sources of animal protein on the planet. Squid are also surprisingly equipped to handle climate change: Ocean acidification doesn’t seem to bother the animal, and rising ocean temperatures can cause it to reproduce more quickly. 
人类吃鱿鱼是有道理的。有环保意识的厨师喜欢它，因为它是地球上碳排放最低的动物蛋白来源之一。鱿鱼在应对气候变化方面的能力也令人惊讶：海洋酸化似乎不会影响这种动物，海洋温度上升会使其繁殖得更快。

While Hamas’s equipment is relatively low tech, it used drones and its own intelligence to defeat Israel’s supposedly invincible border, which was replete with sophisticated cameras, sensors and automatic guns. Israel’s overconfidence, complacency and overreliance on technology, as well as the fact that Oct. 7 was a Jewish holiday, were all instrumental in its defeat that day. But we didn’t think about Hamas attacking the cameras or using hang gliders,
虽然哈马斯的装备技术含量相对较低，但它利用无人机和自己的情报打败了以色列本应坚不可摧的边境，那里布满了精密的摄像头、传感器和自动枪支。以色列的过度自信、自满和对技术的过度依赖，以及10月7日是犹太节日的事实，都是导致以色列在那天失败的重要原因。但我们没想过哈马斯会攻击摄像头或使用悬挂式滑翔机

There has always been a tension between public support for the Palestinian cause, sometimes used by Arab leaders to deflect domestic criticism, and the colder judgment of those leaders that Palestinian Islamist militants supported by Iran, like Hamas, were threats to their own governments, and that better relations with Israel mattered more.
一方面巴勒斯坦人的事业有公众支持——阿拉伯领导人自己有时也会利用这种支持来转移国内的批评，另一方面是领导人们的冰冷计算——哈马斯这样的巴勒斯坦伊斯兰武装组织有伊朗在支持，是对其政府的威胁，且与以色列改善关系更为重要，两者间始终存在一种此消彼长的紧张关系。

To put all that at risk if we turn our backs on Ukraine, if we walk away from Israel — it’s just not worth it.Only Washington, which now has unprecedented moral prestige in Israel, is capable of assembling the pieces from this war. Only the United States can provide some degree of hope that a new paradigm will be established “in which Palestinian self-determination will finally be addressed.” American statements on a two-state solution and the settlements “have been seen as platitudes, But to do something concrete now, it’s not too late.”
如果我们抛弃乌克兰，如果我们不管以色列，这一切都会面临危险——这是不值得的。如今华盛顿在以色列有着空前的道德威望，只有它可以在这场战争之后将一切缝合起来.只有美国可以带来这样的希望，能让一种新的范式建立起来，从而“让巴勒斯坦自决的问题终于得到解决”。美国在两国方案和定居点扩张问题上的声明“被认为是老调重弹,但是现在开始做一些切实的事情还不算晚。”

For 20 months, the Biden administration has attempted to stake out the moral high ground against Russia, condemning its brutal war on Ukraine for indiscriminately killing civilians.Now, as Israel bombards the Gaza Strip, killing more than 4,300 people since Oct. 7, the Biden administration’s unwavering support risks creating new headwinds in its efforts to win over global public opinion.
20个月来，拜登政府一直试图占据反对俄罗斯的道德制高点，谴责俄罗斯在乌克兰的残酷战争中不加选择地杀死平民。现在，随着以色列自10月7日以来一直在轰炸加沙地带，已造成4300多人死亡，拜登政府坚定不移地支持以色列的做法有给其赢得全球舆论的努力制造新阻力的风险。

But Israel’s counterattack on Gaza, its threats to mount a ground invasion and America’s tight embrace of its most important Mideast ally, regardless, have prompted cries of hypocrisy.The war in the Middle East will drive a growing wedge between the West and countries like Brazil or Indonesia, key swing states of the Global South,
但以色列对加沙发起反击，威胁发动地面入侵，以及美国对其最重要的中东盟友的坚定支持已引发人们直指其虚伪。中东战争将加剧西方国家与巴西或印度尼西亚等全球南方的关键摇摆国家之间的隔阂

Anywhere else, attacking civilian infrastructure and deliberately starving an entire population of food, water, basic necessities would be condemned, accountability would be enforced,International law loses all value if it is implemented selectively
在其他任何地方，袭击民用基础设施、蓄意让全体人民挨饿、没水喝、缺少基本的生活必需品，都会受到谴责，也会被追究责任，如果对这种做法进行选择性的谴责，国际法就失去了所有价值。

In some ways the Gaza conflict has been a boon to the Kremlin, knocking the spotlight off the Ukraine war and burnishing Russia’s image in the Middle East and Global South.Russian support for Hamas has been seen as an extension of those efforts, with Mr. Putin comparing the siege of Gaza to the World War II siege of Leningrad, a sacred Russian symbol.
从某些方面来看，加沙冲突对克里姆林宫来说是件好事，它让人们不再关注俄乌战争，并提升了俄罗斯在中东和全球南方的形象。俄罗斯支持哈马斯被视为是这些努力的延伸，普京将围困加沙与第二次世界大战期间围困列宁格勒做比较，列宁格勒保卫战在俄罗斯具有神圣意义。

The Gaza conflict may make winning support for Ukraine “marginally more difficult,” he said, but by no means impossible.The United States will take a hit in global public opinion for its support of Israel in the short term, but that will probably fade over time, he predicted, and should not dissuade Washington from continuing to make its case on Ukraine.that means that all small, comparatively weak states would be at the mercy of their larger neighbors,
加沙冲突可能会使赢得更多国家支持乌克兰“稍微困难一些”，他说，但绝非不可能。他预测，美国将因支持以色列而受到全球舆论的短期打击，但随着时间的推移，这种影响可能将消失，而且这不应该阻止华盛顿继续在乌克兰问题上表明立场。这意味着所有弱小国家只能任由更大邻国的摆布

I’m not a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, but a passage in the book “Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions” seems applicable here. “Nothing pays off like restraint of tongue and pen,” writes A.A.’s co-founder Bill Wilson. “We must avoid quick-tempered criticism and furious, power-driven arguments,” which he calls “emotional booby traps baited with pride and vengefulness.” I’ll admit I have posted on social media from a place of pride and vengeance, and as a writer, I’m perhaps less conditioned to practice restraint of pen and avoidance of arguments. But thoughtful criticism is my goal, and while I’ve regretted posting half-formed thoughts too quickly, I’ve never regretted waiting until I was less angry or not posting at all.
我不是匿名戒酒会的成员，但《十二步骤和十二传统》(Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions)一书中的一段话似乎适用于这里。“没有什么比克制自己的言语和笔墨更有效了，”匿名戒酒会的联合创始人比尔·威尔逊写道。“我们必须避免草率的批评和愤怒的、以权力为导向的争论。”他称之为“由骄傲和报复心诱使的情感陷阱”。我承认，我在社交媒体上发过带有傲慢和报复情绪的帖子，作为一名作家，我可能不太习惯克制自己的笔触和避免争论。但深思熟虑的批评是我的目标，我曾为太快发表半成型的想法而后悔，但我从未因为等到自己不那么生气的时候再发表或者根本没有发表想法而后悔。

It had already estimated that restrictions on sales to China would hold down revenue this year by $2 billion; executives added that the expanded rules issued this week wouldn’t materially change that estimate.An Applied Materials spokesman said the company was still reviewing the new rules to gauge their potential impact.
公司此前曾估计，对华销售限制将导致公司今年的收入减少20亿美元；高管们补充说，上周发布的新规定不会让这个估计发生实质性的改变。应用材料公司的发言人表示，公司仍在仔细研究新规定，以评估可能的影响。

As the United States tries to slow China’s progress toward technological advances that could help its military, the complex lithography machines that print intricate circuitry on computer chips have become a key choke point.
随着美国试图减缓中国在可能有助于提高其军事能力的技术方面取得进步，将错综复杂的电路印到计算机芯片上的复杂光刻机已成了一个关键的钳制点。

These absences are not particularly surprising. It’s normal for American presidents to say chest-pounding things like “There is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity” rather than to talk about possible limits on our strength. And since we don’t actually want to be at war with China, it makes a certain sense to avoid lumping Beijing in with Moscow and Tehran.Likewise, a president’s rhetoric lacunas inform political priorities, at least within his own coalition. 
这些缺失并不特别令人惊讶。美国总统常常会说些“没有任何东西，任何，超出我们的能力范围”之类振振有词的话，而不是谈论我们的力量可能受到的限制。既然我们实际上不想与中国开战，那么避免将北京与莫斯科和德黑兰混为一谈也是有一定道理的。同样，总统的言论缺漏也会影响政治优先事项，至少在他自己的联盟内部是这样。

Moreover, China offers a somewhat coherent ideological alternative to the liberal-democratic order. The Putin regime is a parody of Western democracy, and Iran’s mixture of theocracy and pseudodemocracy holds little broad appeal. 
此外，中国提供了某种连贯的意识形态方案，可以取代自由民主秩序。普京政权是对西方民主的拙劣模仿，而伊朗的神权政治与伪民主的混合没有什么广泛的吸引力。

Distrustful of their government, South Koreans have a penchant for taking all manner of grievances to the streets, so much so that it has turned demonstrating into a kind of national pastime. As the coronavirus pandemic has receded, protest rallies have returned​ to Seoul with a vengeance. Barely a weekend passes without the city center ​turning into a raucous bazaar ringing with ​livestreamed protest songs, slogans and speeches that reveal a country increasingly polarized over its president.
韩国人不信任政府，喜欢用走上街头的方式表达各种不满，以至于示威活动变成了一种全国性的消遣。随着新冠病毒大流行的消退，抗议集会更频繁地重返首尔。几乎每个周末，市中心都会变成喧闹的集会场所，扬声器里直播着抗议歌曲、口号和演讲，向外界展示这个国家对总统的看法日益两极分化。

A typical demonstration features colorful banners and dance troupes romping on a temporary platform as concert speakers dangling from crane trucks blare protest songs. Organizers lead the crowd in chanting slogans, pumping their fists in unison or waving national flags. Peddlers weave through the throng hawking rain cover in summer and plastic cushions in winter. The hourslong rally usually ends with a march. Police officers walk alongside the demonstrations to keep order.
典型的示威活动包括色彩缤纷的横幅，在临时搭起的台子上跳舞的表演团，挂在吊车上的音乐会扬声器里传出抗议歌曲。组织者们带领着人群高喊口号，一起举起拳头或挥舞国旗。小贩们穿插在人群中，夏季兜售防雨罩，冬季兜售塑料垫。长达数小时的集会通常以游行结束。警察们走在示威者两旁维持秩序。

Progressives’ rallies often employ pageantry, reflecting a celebration of the democracy they won from a past military dictatorship. Singers satirize government policies. Young activists ​stage song-and-dance performance​s depicting Mr. Yoon as a clueless drunkard. Families ​often attend ​the rallies with children​. Some dance while marching.
进步派的集会常常有华丽的场面，庆祝他们从过去的军事独裁统治下赢得了民主。歌手讽刺政府的政策。年轻的活动人士编排歌舞表演，将尹锡悦描绘成一个无知的酒鬼。参加集会的家庭​经常把孩子带来​。有些人游行时边走边跳舞。

Earlier this month, Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, also met in Beijing with Mr. Xi, who struck an amicable tone, saying that there were “a thousand reasons” the two countries should make their relationship work.
本月早些时候，美国多数党领袖、参议员查克·舒默也在北京会见了习近平。习近平当时以友好的口吻表示，两国有“一千条理由”搞好关系。

When Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana wanted to make the case against abortion rights last year during a Capitol Hill committee hearing, he grilled a witness in graphic fashion. The exchange reflected the lawmaker’s deeply conservative views, particularly on social issues, and his tendency to express them in inflammatory ways.
去年，当路易斯安那州众议员迈克·约翰逊在国会山一个委员会的听证会上提出反堕胎权利的理由时，他用非常直白的方式对一名证人进行了盘问。这场交锋反映了约翰逊极其保守的价值观——尤其是对社会问题——以及他爱用煽动性的方式表达这些观点的倾向。

Heavy fire from rooftops and booby-trapped apartments. Armor-piercing projectiles blowing up troop carriers. Fighters blending in with civilians, launching drone ambushes, or surging from tunnels full of enough ammunition, food and water to sustain a long war.
来自屋顶的猛烈火力和布设了诡雷的公寓。穿甲弹炸毁运兵车。战斗人员混进平民之中，发动无人机伏击，或者从地道中冲出来，那些地道里储备了足以支撑一场长期战争的弹药、食物和水。

Many urban invasions — from the Middle Ages to modernity — have started off with a rapid advance, only to later bog down in districts that favor defenders. Cities can also be malleable.Cities can mitigate your technological advantages
从中世纪到现代，许多城市入侵都以快速推进开始，但后来却在有利于防御者的地区陷入僵局。城市也可以是可塑的。城市可以削弱你的技术优势

Mr. Li, who had a doctorate in economics, exemplified a generation of highly educated Chinese leaders who rose up as Mao Zedong’s generation faded from politics. As premier, Mr. Li spoke of giving markets a greater role in the economy, and he promised a fairer playing field for private companies, saying they would get the same access as state-owned firms to bank loans, land and other resources.
拥有经济学博士学位的李克强是受过高等教育的一代中国领导人中的佼佼者，他们在毛泽东一代淡出政坛之际崛起。作为总理，李克强提出要让市场在经济中发挥更大作用，并承诺为民营企业提供更公平的竞争环境，称它们将在获得银行贷款、土地和其他资源等方面享受与国企同等的待遇。

“We must turn grief into strength, and learn from his revolutionary spirit, noble character and outstanding work style,” said the obituary, urging the country to rally around Mr. Xi. Mr. Li will also likely be remembered for an anecdote that gave birth to a closely watched, unofficial economic gauge.
讣告写道，“我们要化悲痛为力量，学习他的革命精神、崇高品德和优良作风”，号召全国团结在习近平周围。李克强还可能因为一则轶事而被铭记，这则轶事催生了一个受到密切关注的非官方经济指标。

To Dr. Yousef Al-Akkad, the director of the European Gaza Hospital, a medical center in southern Gaza, the strikes constitute “an attempt to satisfy the instinct of revenge and vengeance within Israeli society by bringing the number of martyrs to unprecedented levels.”
加沙南部医疗中心欧洲加沙医院的院长尤塞夫·阿卡德博士认为，袭击是“企图让殉难者的人数达到前所未有的水平，来满足以色列社会内部的复仇和报复本能”。

Tens of thousands of Hamas gunmen are thought to be lying in wait, most of them in the group’s sprawling tunnel networks. Analysts expect that Hamas will try to slow Israel’s advance by exploding some tunnels once soldiers are in their vicinity; setting roadside bombs; booby-trapping buildings and emerging suddenly from hidden tunnel entrances and ambushing Israelis from behind.
据信有数以万计的哈马斯武装分子正在伺机而动，其中大多数藏身于该组织庞大的地道网络中。有专家预测，一旦以军进入周边地区，哈马斯可能会炸毁部分地道，以延缓以色列的推进；或是设置路边炸弹；在建筑物中埋下诡雷，从隐蔽的地道口突然伏击以军后方。

“Let’s say you’re a foot soldier and you want to get to a strategic point,” Mr. Shafir said. “You don’t want to be flanked by units shooting at you at close range, either with small-arms fire or short range missiles. And so you need a kind of corridor so that you can see where you’re going.”
“假如你是一名想要抵达某战略要点的步兵，”沙菲尔说。“你肯定不希望被近距离射击部队所包围，不管对方是用的是轻武器还是短程导弹。所以我们需要开辟一条通道，这样才能看清楚方向。”
