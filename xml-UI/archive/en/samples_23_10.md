The values of liberal democracy — which emphasize individual rights and freedoms for all people — are enshrined by the United Nations and were celebrated as truths we hold “to be self-evident,” in the words of the American Declaration of Independence. In other words, so widely accepted as to require no proof.But are they really? The question is taking on more importance now, as liberal democracy, especially in the United States, which is seen globally as a model, seems to be degrading into fierce polarization over cultural, religious and racial questions.
自由民主的价值观——强调所有人的个人权利和自由——被联合国奉为圭臬，用美国《独立宣言》的话来说，它被视为“不言而喻”的真理。换句话说，它被广泛接受，以至于无需证明。但真的是这样吗？这个问题现在变得更加重要，因为自由民主似乎在文化、宗教和种族问题上正堕入激烈的两极分化，尤其是在被全球视为典范的美国。

In reaction, Lee Kuan Yew, who served as the founding prime minister of Singapore from 1959 to 1990, argued against the idea of universal values, asserting that Asian or “Confucian” values emphasized family and community more than individual rights and were just as valid. His argument was seen by some as a way to justify what was widely viewed as Singapore’s paternalistic and heavy-handed government. But it was also a response to what many saw as Western cultural imperialism, an extension of the older missionary effort to convert the world to Christianity.
作为回应，在1959年至1990年期间担任新加坡开国总理的李光耀反对普世价值的理念，声称亚洲或“儒家”价值观同样有效，这种价值观更强调家庭和社区，而不是个人权利。在一些人看来，他的观点是在为人们普遍视为的新加坡家长式作风和高压政府辩护。但这也是对许多人眼中的西方文化帝国主义的回应，这种文化帝国主义是老一辈传教士努力使世界皈依基督教的延伸。

The Chinese and prominent Asian intellectuals like Kishore Mahbubani of Singapore have regularly accused their critics of using human rights as a kind of cudgel, pretending to be arguing for freedom and universal values while in reality pursuing their own political and economic agendas.That is an argument now more widely shared in the Global South, which is heterogeneous but wants the current, post-World War II, Western-dominated multilateral global order to be replaced by a more diverse, open system — one that recognizes that the world has changed and new powers have risen.
中国人和像新加坡的马凯硕这样的知名亚洲知识分子经常指责他们的批评者把人权问题当武器，假装在论证自由和普世价值，实际上却是在运作他们自己的政治和经济议程。这一看法目前在全球南方得到了更多支持。虽然并非铁板一块，但全球南方认为应该摒弃当下由西方主导的二战后多边全球秩序，转向一个更多元、开放的系统——这个系统要承认世界已经改变，新的势力已经崛起。
