Among many Chinese, Mr. Li’s death produced a swell of nostalgia for what he represented.They shared photos of him, standing in ankle-deep mud, visiting victims of a flood. They recited Mr. Li’s most famous quotes: “Power must not be arbitrary” and “It’s harder to touch interests than souls.”
在许多中国人当中，李克强的去世激起了对他所代表的那个时代的怀念,他们分享他站在没过脚踝的泥泞中探望洪水灾民的照片。 人们还列出了李克强最著名的发言：“有权不可任性”和“触动利益比触及灵魂还难”。

its hair-trigger internet censors are keenly attuned to the wishes of its leaders, quick to remove any content that sways public sentiment in an unwanted direction, especially on matters of such geopolitical importance. casually calling people Nazis only reveals your own stupidity. It added that people combining the Israeli flag with Nazi symbols in their profile pictures are “either ignorant idiots or shameless bastards!”
行动迅速的互联网审查员们对领导人的愿望极为熟悉，会很快删除任何对公众情绪产生不利影响的内容，尤其涉及如此重要的地缘政治的内容。“随意地称呼别人为纳粹只会暴露自己的愚蠢”。还写道，在个人头像里将以色列国旗与纳粹符号相结合的人，“不是无知的蠢货，就是无耻的混蛋！”

Historically, Chinese people tended to perpetuate positive stereotypes about Jews, according to Mary Ainslie, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham’s campus in Ningbo, a city in eastern China, who has done research on antisemitism in the country. She said they were often depicted as hard-working, influential and financially savvy. For example, the Talmud is translated into Chinese and marketed for its lessons in making money.
历史上，中国人往往对犹太人保持着正面的刻板印象，在诺丁汉大学位于宁波的校区教书的副教授玛丽·艾因斯利说道，她研究过中国的反犹太主义。她说，在中国人看来，犹太人努力工作、有支配力、会赚钱。例如，《塔木德》（犹太法典——译注）被翻译成中文，并作为赚钱教材来营销。

There is a moment in Britney Spears’s new memoir when she is summoned to an MTV studio and made to review footage of strangers complaining that she was “too sexy.” Spears, then 18, had just performed at the 2000 Video Music Awards, where she had torn off a sparkly black tuxedo to reveal spangled nude pants and a spangled nude bra, and various pedestrians roving Times Square had decided that she had crossed a line.
布兰妮·斯皮尔斯在新出版的回忆录中描述了这样一个场面：她被叫到一个MTV演播室，并被要求观看陌生人如何抱怨她“过于性感”的视频。当时，18岁的斯皮尔斯刚在2000年MTV颁奖礼的演出中脱掉黑色亮片燕尾服，露出闪亮的裸色裤子和抹胸，时报广场上往来的许多路人看到了这一幕，都认为她已经越界。

I dropped by his home in Tel Aviv, and we sat in his office, surrounded by his collection of framed cartoons mocking him — he has a thick skin — as he argued in favor of a ground invasion as the only way to crush Hamas.There is no way but to send many tens of thousands of boots on the ground,On balance, he thinks that it is possible for Israel to destroy most of Hamas’s capabilities, establish a no-go zone along the border and extricate itself.
我顺便拜访了他在特拉维夫的家，我们坐在他的办公室里听他阐述他支持地面入侵是制服哈马斯唯一途径的理由，办公室的墙上挂满了相框，都是他收藏的嘲笑他的漫画，他不计较脸面。 除了派几万军人去实地作战，没有别的办法,总的来说，他认为，以色列能做到摧毁哈马斯的大部分能力，沿边境建一个禁区，使自己抽身出来。

My reporting in Gaza over the years convinces me that Gazans themselves would be much better off if Hamas could be removed: Some American liberals don’t appreciate how repressive, misogynistic, homophobic and economically incompetent Hamas is in Gaza, to say nothing of its long history of terror attacks on Israel. All this explains why many Gazans are fed up with Hamas. Because of the siege, Gaza is also running out of insulin and anesthetic
我对加沙进行了多年的报道，我相信，如果哈马斯能被消灭的话，加沙人自己会过得更好。一些美国自由派人士不了解哈马斯在加沙的镇压、厌女、仇视同性恋的做法，以及经济上的无能，更不用说哈马斯对以色列进行恐怖袭击的长期历史了。所有这些解释了为什么许多加沙人受够了哈马斯。由于围困，加沙的胰岛素和麻醉剂很快将用光。

He was glued to the screen as videos showed areas the size of multiple football fields near his home turned into rubble; satellite imagery shows other large areas pulverized as well. No one knows how many people are caught in the wreckage, but some Gazans told me they had heard cries from inside collapsed buildings. They lack proper equipment to rescue people, so eventually, the cries stop, and a stench rises.
他目不转睛地看着视频，看着他家附近的几个足球场大的地片变成瓦砾；卫星图像显示，大片其他地区也被夷为平地。没人知道还有多少人仍在废墟里，但一些加沙人告诉我，他们曾听到倒塌的建筑物里传出哭叫声。他们没有正规的救人设备，所以最终，哭叫声停止了，恶臭开始飘散。

But in the short run, U.S. officials have grown more strident in reminding the Israelis that even if Hamas terrorists are deliberately intermingling with civilians, operations must be tailored to avoid nonmilitary casualties. On Sunday, Sullivan signaled that the United States would continue to press Israel, publicly and privately, for restraint.“Sitting here in public,” Sullivan added, “I will just say that the United States is going to make its principles and propositions absolutely clear, including the sanctity of innocent human life. 
但在短期内，美国官员越来越强硬地提醒以色列，即使哈马斯恐怖分子故意与平民混在一起，行动也必须有所调整，以避免非军事人员伤亡。周日，沙利文暗示，美国将在公开和私下场合继续敦促以色列保持克制。“面对公众，”苏利文还表示，“我只想说，美国将清清楚楚地亮明原则和主张，包括无辜人命神圣不可侵犯。

He said that if Israel did not follow that advice, “they’ll be held accountable in ways that may be unfair,” but he added: “If you have an opportunity to alleviate the pain, you should do it, period. And if you don’t, you’re going to lose credibility worldwide.” For Biden, the tightrope walk continues.
他说如果以色列不听从这一建议，“他们恐怕将以不尽公平的方式承担责任，”但他补充道，“能减轻痛苦就去减轻痛苦，就这么简单。如果不这么做，就会在全球声名扫地。”而拜登还得继续走钢索。

When Israeli ground forces advanced en masse into the Gaza Strip on Friday evening, just after the Jewish Sabbath began, The goal of such strategic ambiguity is threefold, analysts say. The fog may also buy Israel some time. Modern war is conducted not only with tanks and airplanes,It’s a cyberwar, a psychological war, and an informational war.
上周五晚，在犹太人的安息日刚开始不久，以色列地面部队大规模进入了加沙地带，分析人士表示，这种战略模糊性有三重目的。这种模糊也可能为以色列赢得一些时间。现代战争不只是用坦克和飞机，现代战争是网络战、心理战、信息战。

The shroud of secrecy began late Friday afternoon, when Israel jammed Gaza’s internet and telecoms networks, according to senior U.S. officials, stopping Gazans from sharing what they were seeing.Once the operation began, army spokesmen stopped answering their phones. The information blackout was complete.
诡秘气氛是上周五下午晚些时候开始的，据美国高级官员说，以色列屏蔽了加沙的互联网和电信网络，让加沙人无法分享他们正在看到的情况。行动开始后，以军发言人不再接听电话。信息被全部封锁。

At first glance, their words seemed like a sepia-tinted throwback: invoking, as a remedy for the worst eruption of bloodshed between Israelis and Palestinians in many years, the faded relic of a peace process that many on both sides viewed as dead and buried some time late in the Obama administration.
他们的言论乍看上去像是一种倒退，搬出了奥巴马政府执政后期被巴以双方许多人视为毫无希望且被埋葬已久的和平进程遗物，当作对这场多年来最严重的巴以流血冲突的补救措施。

Mr. Bankman-Fried once partied with stars and big shots, doled out fortunes in looted funds to politicians and himself, was acclaimed as the next Warren Buffett, employed his friends and made them rich for a while, was courted by the news media that printed his most banal comments. 
班克曼-弗里德曾与明星和大人物过从甚密，把掠夺来的财富分配给政治人士和自己，被誉为下一个沃伦·巴菲特，他雇用自己的朋友，让他们暴富一时，新闻媒体也曾向他大献殷勤，刊登他最平庸的言论。

The central myth of Silicon Valley is that techies are here to save the world. If they get insanely rich in the process, well, that only proves how great their idea was in the first place.FTX allowed people to bet on cryptocurrencies. It was, in essence, a casino. It is difficult for even the most sympathetic journalist to portray a casino as a savior of humanity, so the focus of the stories was always on Mr. Bankman-Fried himself.
硅谷的核心神话是，技术人员是来拯救世界的。如果他们在这个过程中赚了大钱，那只能证明他们的想法最初是多么伟大。FTX允许人们押注加密货币。从本质上讲，这是一个赌场。即使是最富有同情心的记者，也很难把赌场描绘成人类的救世主，所以这些报道始终是聚焦在班克曼-弗里德本人身上。

Geography and weather patterns pose challenges for China in reducing coal use. Most of the country’s large, energy-thirsty cities are in areas where wind is minimal. That makes solar generation and efficient transmission from other regions crucial.By contrast, the coastline is windy.
地理和气候给中国减少燃煤带来了挑战。该国大部分能源需求旺盛的大城市都地处风力极少的地区，这使得太阳能发电和从其他地区的高效输电变得至关重要。相较之下，沿海地区风力较大。

In Weifang, which hosts international kite-flying contests, hundreds of wind turbines stand in tidal pools along the city’s 70-mile seashore. Building turbines miles out to sea, as Europe has done, has been hard for China because much of the seafloor is soft and muddy.
潍坊是国际风筝比赛的举办地，沿着该市约110公里长的海岸线，数以百计的风力涡轮机就伫立潮汐池中。因为大部分海底都松软泥泞，中国很难像欧洲那样在很远的海上建造涡轮机。

Sharp improvements in air quality in China have also helped build public support for renewable energy — although scientists say more stringent pollution limits on factories, boilers and vehicles have played a central role in scrubbing the country’s air. From 2013 to 2021, China reduced fine particle pollutants by 42 percent, according to a University of Chicago analysis of satellite photos.
中国空气质量的大幅改善也帮助争取到了公众对可再生能源的支持，尽管科学家表示，对工厂、锅炉和车辆实施更严格的污染限制在改善空气质量方面发挥了核心作用。根据芝加哥大学的卫星图片分析，从2013年到2021年，中国的细颗粒污染物减少了42%。

Zhu Peng, a fertilizer saleswoman who went fishing on a recent morning on a Weifang beach, said she welcomed the wind turbines looming nearby.“For us, this is the scenery,” she said. “I don’t think it’s disturbing at all. Otherwise, we can see nothing but water and rocks.
化肥销售员朱彭最近一天早上到潍坊的海滩边钓鱼，她很乐于看到附近巍然耸立的风力涡轮机。“对于我们来说，这里就是风景，”她说。“不感觉它碍事，不然光秃秃能看到啥，除了水就是石头。”

In a youth hostel in downtown Shanghai, amid the dull roar of a hair dryer, the shriek of a blender and the lingering aroma of spicy instant noodles, Ethan Yi, 23, was pondering the state of the world. He showed the sparse contents of a silver hard-shell suitcase — a few tangled shirts and shorts, taking up barely a quarter of the space — as if manifesting that short timeline into existence.
上海市中心的一家青年旅舍里，吹风机单调的呜呜声和食物搅拌器刺耳的旋转声不绝于耳，空气中散发着辛辣方便面的味道，23岁的伊森·易在琢磨着生活之难。他一直住在旅舍，因为希望在上海住的时间不长。他的银色硬壳行李箱里没有多少东西，只有几件胡乱折叠的衬衫和短裤，占了不到四分之一的空间，仿佛要将短暂停留的愿望显现为现实似的。

There comes a moment in the development of a new technology when the hype is so common it passes for common sense. Lawyers, accountants and regulators are nowhere to be found. Investors insist entrepreneurs take their money. The world trembles on the brink of change.
在一项新技术的发展过程中，总会出现这样的时刻：大肆宣传实在太普遍，以至于被当作常识。看不到律师、会计师和监管机构的身影。投资者执意要创业者拿走他们的钱。世界在变革的边缘颤抖。

Iran, Russia and, to a lesser degree, China have used state media and the world’s major social networking platforms to support Hamas and undercut Israel, while denigrating Israel’s principal ally, the United States. The deluge of online propaganda and disinformation is larger than anything seen before,The content — visceral, emotionally charged, politically slanted and often false — has stoked anger and even violence far beyond Gaza, raising fears that it could inflame a wider conflict. 
伊朗、俄罗斯和相对没那么积极的中国利用官方媒体和全球主流社交网络平台支持哈马斯，批评以色列，并诋毁以色列的主要盟友美国。网络上的宣传和虚假信息比以往任何时候都更加泛滥.这些账号传播的内容——这些非理性的、情绪化的、带有政治倾向且往往是虚假的信息，在加沙之外的地方激起愤怒乃至暴力，引发了关于其可能点燃更广泛冲突的担忧。

Israel, which has its own sophisticated information operations, has found itself unexpectedly on the defensive.Like its military, Israel’s social media was caught flat-footed and responded days late,The response, even when it got off the ground, was chaotic.
以色列拥有先进的信息行动，却意外地发现自己处于守势。和以色列的军队一样，以色列的社交媒体被打了个措手不及，反应晚了几天，即使着手反制，策略上也杂乱无章。

Since 2017, Australia has played David to China’s Goliath.Australia’s rhetoric has softened. Yet anxiety and security concerns persist.Even among those set to benefit from the stabilization in relations, the impact of the past few years seems destined to limit exuberance.
自2017年以来，澳大利亚一直与中国进行着力量悬殊的较量，澳大利亚的对华言论已经软化。但焦虑和安全担忧依然存在。即使对那些将从稳定关系中受益的人来说，过去几年的影响似乎也注定会降低他们的热情。

If Australia was and will be a bellwether for relations with China, as many Western powers believe, regular trade and dialogue — rather than the enthusiasm for future opportunities that defined the early years of China’s economic rise — may be as good as it gets. 
如果澳大利亚曾是并将是某种风向标的话（如许多西方大国所认为的那样），那么，对华关系除了惯常的贸易和对话外不会有更多的好转，而不会有在中国经济崛起之初时的那种对未来机遇的热忱。

The government believed that China’s economy would snap back in 2023 after the country’s leaders lifted most “zero Covid” restrictions that quashed the economy last year. China’s policymakers triggered the sector’s recent decline by starting to rein in lending several years ago, and now are reluctant to rescue the sector by kicking off another binge of housing loans.
中国政府曾以为，国家领导人取消了最严格的“新冠清零”措施后，中国经济会在2023年出现反弹，中国的政策制定者们已在几年前开始限制向房地产业贷款，引发了该行业最近的衰退，但政策制定者现在不愿意通过再次大规模发放住房贷款来拯救房地产业。

And by the end of 2024,  China will have built in just five years as many petrochemical factories as all of those now running in Europe plus Japan and South Korea.But they predicted that big investments in new manufacturing technologies would pay off.
到2024年底，中国将在短短五年时间里建成的石化厂将与欧洲、日本和韩国目前运营的数量相当。但他们预测，对新的制造技术的大笔投资将带来回报。

Aware of these risks, China is wooing developing countries. These countries still have sizable but often aging manufacturing sectors that provide an opening for exports from newly built, highly efficient factories in China.Officials have tried repeatedly for years to tame its debt addiction. 
意识到这些风险，中国正在发展中国家寻求市场。这些国家虽然也有规模庞大的制造业，但设备比较陈旧，这为中国更新、更高效的工厂出口产品提供了机会。多年来，官员们曾多次试图戒掉靠债务增长经济的习惯。

In some instances, the U.S. military enabled many civilians to leave the cities well before the fighting.And Hamas has been burrowing into Gaza’s infrastructure for more than 15 years.There is no agreed-upon formula for making such morbid calculations.The pace of bombing in Gaza is off the charts 
在某些情况下，美军在战斗发生前相当早的时间就通知许多平民离开城市。哈马斯在加沙地下修建设施已超过15年。没有一个公认的公式来进行这种不正常的计算。轰炸加沙的节奏超乎想象

China recently rattled the world’s electric vehicle supply chains by announcing new export controls on graphite, a key component of lithium-ion batteries. Unlike in the 20th century, when China was largely a bystander in petroleum politics.China controlled 58 percent of the global production of lithium compounds in 2022, 69 percent of nickel sulfate, 69 percent of synthetic graphite, 75 percent of cobalt, 95 percent of manganese and 100 percent of spherical graphite. 
不久前，中国宣布对生产锂离子电池的关键原料——石墨实施新的出口管制，令全球电动汽车供应链深感不安。与20世纪不同，当时中国在石油政治中基本上属于一个旁观者。.2022年中国控制了全球58%的锂化合物产量、69%的硫酸镍、69%的合成石墨、75%的钴、95%的锰，以及100%的球形石墨。

Climate action can no longer be about phasing out fossil fuels alone. It must also be about phasing in a new set of extractive industries needed to enable a clean-energy transition. China figured this out a decade ago. The place to begin is by reckoning with what it is going to take to build a clean-energy future, from the ground up.
气候行动不能再仅仅是分阶段淘汰化石燃料。它还必须逐步引入一系列新的采掘业，以实现清洁能源转型。中国在十年前就明白了这一点。我们首先要考虑的是，如何从头开始建设一个清洁能源的未来。

The success of the government’s efforts to regulate A.I. will turn on its ability to stay focused on concrete problems like deep fakes, as opposed to getting swept up in hypothetical risks like the arrival of our robot overlords.Mr. Biden’s executive order outdoes even the Europeans by considering just about every potential risk one could imagine, from everyday fraud to the development of weapons of mass destruction. 
这些已成为日常的事件都指向一个重要的事实，那就是监管人工智能的努力是否成功，将决定政府能否专注于解决诸如深度伪造的切实问题，而不是被机器主宰人类等臆想危险所淹没。拜登的行政命令甚至超出了欧洲政府的监管范畴，从无处不在的诈骗到大规模杀伤性武器的研发，涵盖了人们能想到的几乎所有潜在风险。

But if social networking was a wolf in sheep’s clothing, artificial intelligence is more like a wolf clothed as a horseman of the apocalypse. The temptation to overreact is understandable. No one wants to be the clueless government official in the disaster movie who blithely waves off the early signs of pending cataclysm. 
但如果说社交网络是披着羊皮的狼，那人工智能这头“狼”更像是披上了末日骑士的外衣。忍不住想拿出过度反应是可以理解的。谁也不想成为灾难电影里那些无知的官员，对即将到来的灾变的早期征兆不屑一顾。

But the truth is that no one knows if any of these world-shattering developments will come to pass. Tech history is full of confident projections and “inevitabilities” that never happened, from the 30-hour and 15-hour workweeks to the demise of television. Testifying in grave tones about terrifying possibilities makes for good television.
但事实是，没人知道这些惊天动地的发展是否能够实现。从每周30小时和15小时的工作时间到电视的消亡，科技的历史中充斥着始终没有发生的自信预期和“必然”。以沉重口吻论述令人恐惧的可能性确实能吸引眼球。

To regulate speculative risks, rather than actual harms, would be unwise, for two reasons. First, overeager regulators can fixate shortsightedly on the wrong target of regulation. today’s policymakers are preoccupied with large language models like ChatGPT, which could be the future of everything — or, given their gross unreliability stemming from chronic falsification and fabrication, may end up remembered as the Hula Hoop of the A.I. age.
监管充满变数的风险而非实际危害的做法并不明智，原因有二。首先，过于急切的监管者可能会目光短浅地锁定错误的监管对象。今天的政策制定者都在关注ChatGPT这样的大语言模型，它们是可能塑造未来——但考虑到其根植于持续伪造和扭曲的整体不可靠性，它们最终可能只会成为人工智能时代的呼啦圈。

Established players, with millions of dollars to spend on lawyers and experts, can find ways of abiding by a complex set of new regulations, but smaller start-ups typically don’t have the same resources. This fosters monopolization and discourages innovation. These examples aren’t quite as hair-raising as the warning issued this year by the Center for A.I. Safety. To its credit, Mr. Biden’s executive order is not overly caught up in the hypothetical
有实力的企业可以在律师和专家上花费数百万美元，想方设法适应一套复杂的新监管规则，然而规模较小的初创公司通常没有这样的资源。这就会滋养垄断，抑制创新。这些例子听上去不像人工智能安全中心今年发布的警告那么惊悚,值得肯定的是，拜登的行政令并没有完全受制于这样的假说

Regulation, contrary to what you hear in stylized political debates, is not intrinsically aligned with one or another political party. Done correctly, with an eye toward the present, it might protect the vulnerable and promote broader and more salutary innovation.
监管并不像你在程式化的政治辩论中所听到的那样，与这个或那个政党的利益保持着一致。如果能以正确的方式着眼于当下，它也许能保护弱势者，促进更广泛、更有益的创新。

The existence of actual social harm has long been a touchstone of legitimate state action. But that point cuts both ways: The state should proceed cautiously in the absence of harm, but it also has a duty, given evidence of harm, to take action. By that measure, with A.I. we are at risk of doing too much and too little at the same time.
具体社会危害的存在一直都是政府行为是否合理的试金石。但这是把双刃剑：政府在没有危害时应该保持警惕，并在发现危害时有责任采取行动。从这个角度讲，在人工智能的问题上，我们可能在做得过分的同时也做得不够。

The black-and-white fur balls that might as well be waddling stuffies had always struck me as natural diplomats,my 3½-year-old daughter developed an enduring obsession with them.Zoo officials and scientists say the actual reason comes down to biology, or “panda time.” It takes more than bamboo groves to host a panda.
大熊猫有着黑白相间的毛皮，体型圆得像球，看起来像摇摇晃晃行走的毛绒玩具，我一直觉得它们是天生的外交官。我女儿那时三岁半，之后她迷上了熊猫。动物园官员和科学家说，真正的原因可归结为生物学，或“熊猫生命阶段”。想租借大熊猫的动物园需要的不只是竹林。

Until recently, pandas were considered endangered, and so scientists at the National Zoo researched reproductive cycles to help with panda breeding. Ms. Songer said a female panda is fertile for only one or two days each year, and scientists monitor hormone levels using urine samples to determine when to do artificial insemination. That is how Little Miracle was born.
直到不久前，大熊猫曾一直被认为是濒临灭绝的动物，所以美国国家动物园的科学家们为帮助大熊猫繁殖后代，研究过它们的繁殖周期。宋格说，雌性大熊猫每年只有一两天能生育，科学家们用尿液样本来监测雌性大熊猫的激素水平，以确定什么时候进行人工授精。小奇迹就是这样诞生的。

Early Sunday morning, my daughter, Aria, now 11, and I watched as mother, father and son lumbered around their separate indoor and outdoor enclosures, chewing on bamboo, tumbling with plastic balls and clambering over boulders.They looked about as cuddly as the stuffed pandas that Aria slept with every night. Aria regaled me with endless panda trivia: “Did you know that they eat 14 hours a day?”The crowds ballooned, creating a sense of panda-monium.
周日一早，我和我现在11岁的女儿阿丽亚去看了熊猫妈妈、熊猫爸爸和熊猫儿子，它们在各自的室内或室外围场里憨态可掬地走来走去，咀嚼竹子，与塑料球一起翻滚，爬石头。它们看上去与阿丽亚每晚睡觉时抱着的毛绒熊猫一样可爱。阿丽亚没完没了地给我讲有关熊猫的细枝末节：“你知道它们每天花14个小时吃东西吗？”来看熊猫的人群暴增，制造了一种熊情沸腾的感觉。（panda-monium是用“群情沸腾”[pandemonium]造的词——译注。）

It called for China to allow battered developers with no chance of turning themselves around to exit the industry. China has allowed developers that are effectively insolvent to stay in business, a practice that can impede the sector’s recovery.Economists ascribe some of the slack in China’s exports to lackluster interest in manufactured goods by households around the world that stocked up on consumer electronics, furniture and other goods during the pandemic.
该组织呼吁中国允许遭受重创、没有可能改善经营情况的开发商退出这个行业。中国让已经资不抵债的开发商继续经营的做法可能会阻碍房地产行业的复苏。经济学家将中国出口的疲软部分归因于全球家庭对制成品的需求减弱，后者在疫情期间已经囤积了大量消费电子产品、家具和其他商品。

He was belligerent and brash, unrepentant and verbose — regardless of the courtroom setting, he was the quintessential Donald J. Trump.The former president lashed out at his accusers and denied their claims, even while conceding involvement in some of the conduct at the case’s heart.Ranting and rambling as the courtroom pulsed with tension, Mr. Trump attacked New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, as a “political hack.”Mr. Trump exclaimed from the stand, pointing at the judge, who flashed a grin.
他爱逞威风而态度倨傲，油盐不进又喋喋不休。无论身处怎样的法庭环境，他都是那个唐纳德·J·特朗普。虽然承认自己参与了该案核心直指的部分行为，但这位前总统仍然大肆抨击了检方，并否认了其指控。在紧张的法庭气氛中，他大吵大闹、东拉西扯，攻击纽约州总检察长詹乐霞(Letitia James)是“政治打手”。特朗普在证人席上指着恩戈伦喊道，后者咧嘴笑了一下。

He noted that they contained numerous disclaimers, making them essentially ?worthless.? Banks paid little attention to them, he said, before promising, unprompted, that some of his bankers would soon testify in his defense.
他说这些文件包含了大量免责声明，实际上“毫无价值”。他说银行很少关注这些东西，然后还出乎意料地放话称，为他服务的一些银行家很快就能帮他作证。

Mr. Trump, the leading Republican contender for the presidency, brought combative campaign-trail energy to the courtroom, punctuating his testimony with grandiose claims and long-winded asides that infuriated the judge and obscured some of his more effective testimony.The testimony pushed Mr. Trump far outside his campaign-trail comfort zone to the controlled environs of a courtroom, where lying is a crime and outbursts can land you in contempt of court. 
作为支持率最高的共和党总统候选人，特朗普把竞选路上的战斗精神带到了法庭，在证词中夹带了夸大其词和偏离案件的冗长自白，令法官十分恼火，也淹没了他的一些相对有用的证词。这些证词将特朗普远远推出了竞选舒适区，在严格受控的法庭环境中，说谎是一种犯罪，泄愤可能被判藐视法庭。

In a criminal case, a jury or judge cannot hold a defendant's refusal to answer questions against him. But this case is civil, and the rules are different: A judge can make what is called a “negative inference” — a damning assumption about why a defendant won’t answer.
在刑事案件中，陪审团或法官不能因被告拒绝回答问题而做出对他不利的判断。但这是民事案件，规则有所不同：法官可以做出所谓的“负面推断”——对被告拒绝回答问题的原因做出具有破坏性的假设。

Justice Engoron also repeatedly appealed to Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Mr. Kise, to rein in the former president. As Mr. Trump puckered his lips and shrugged his shoulders, Mr. Kise replied that Mr. Trump’s stature — as the “former and again soon-to-be chief executive of the United States” — afforded him leeway.
恩戈伦还多次呼吁特朗普的律师基斯约束这位前总统。特朗普听了噘起嘴唇，耸了耸肩，基斯回答说，以特朗普的地位——作为“美国前任和即将上任的最高行政长官”——理应得到一些特殊照顾。

The International Monetary Fund extends more money in rescue loans each year than China, although the gap has been closing. Beijing increasingly finds itself at odds with the I.M.F. and other creditors over who accepts losses when relieving debt pressure on developing countries.I see it very much as complementary, rather than a trade-off of going to the I.M.F.
国际货币基金组织每年发放的援助贷款比中国多，尽管这一差距一直在缩小。在缓解发展中国家债务压力时由谁承担损失的问题上，中国政府发现自己与国际货币基金组织和其他债权人的分歧越来越大。我认为这在很大程度上是一种互补，而不是在中国和国际货币基金组织之间取舍

It sounds like just another internet health hack: Cook some pasta or white rice and let it cool overnight in the refrigerator. By the next day, some of the natural starches in the food will have transformed into healthier versions, called resistant starches, which have been linked to a range of health benefits including lower blood sugar, better gut health and a reduced risk of certain types of cancer.Resistant starch is a type of fiber that is naturally present in many types of plant foods, such as whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, green bananas and plantains.
这听上去不过是又一个网上的养生小花招：做些意大利面或白米饭，放冰箱冷藏一晚。到了第二天，食物中的天然淀粉会转化成某种更健康的抗性淀粉，可以带来各种健康益处，包括降低血糖、改善肠胃健康、降低某些类型的癌症的风险。抗性淀粉是一种天然存在于某些植物性食物里的纤维，例如全谷、豆类、坚果、种籽、绿香蕉和大蕉。

In its heyday a few years ago, WeWork said it would reinvent offices. But the company never created a sustainable business or changed how most people worked.WeWork filed for bankruptcy protection this week in an effort to quickly slim down its portfolio of office spaces.Many employers are paring back their office space because workers aren’t going in five days a week after growing accustomed to working remotely or on a hybrid schedule.
在几年前的鼎盛时期，WeWork曾表示将会重塑办公室。但是这家公司始终没能成为一门可持续的生意，也没有改变大多数人的工作方式。WeWork本周申请破产保护，以迅速精简其名下的办公空间。许多雇主正在缩减办公空间，因为员工在习惯了远程办公或混合日程安排后，不再每周上班五天。

co-working was a nice amenity for some tenants but wouldn’t take over the commercial real estate business by a long shot.When co-working becomes a disproportionate amount of the building, they become directly competitive with the landlord,I just need to have a place where people can touch down, collaborate, meet up, drop in and feel like there’s a hospitality element.
对一些租户来说，联合办公是一种很好的便利设施，但从长远来看不会取代商业房地产业务。当联合办公空间在大楼中比例过大时，就会直接与业主竞争，我只是需要有一个地方，人们可以在这里落脚、合作、见面、串门，提供一种招待客人的条件。

Prices are falling again in China after a two-month reprieve, with households and businesses wary of spending even as state-controlled banks pump money into the construction of more factories.The decline in prices could put China on the cusp of a pernicious economic condition called deflation
在经历两个月的平稳之后，中国的物价再次下跌，虽然国有银行为建设更多工厂注入了资金，但家庭和企业仍对消费支出持谨慎态度。物价下跌可能是中国通货紧缩的前兆

A blocks-long street of shops selling construction materials like paint, plaster and flooring was completely empty of customers shortly before lunchtime.The prices of apartments in the towers overlooking the street have fallen by 30 to 40 percent in the last several years
一条延伸数个街区的长街上满是出售油漆、石膏和地板等建筑材料的商店，正午时分这里没有任何顾客。过去几年这条街上的高层公寓价格跌了三四成

I don’t think, at a broad level, they’re expecting or see the prospect of resetting or recalibrating the relationship.Many businesses still see China as an essential market, but an increasing number are starting to look to other countries for their new investments. 
在更广泛的层面，我认为他们并不期待或认为两国关系有重塑或调整的可能。许多企业仍将中国视为不可或缺的市场，但越来越多的企业开始寻求在其他国家进行投资。

When House Republicans and a solid bloc of Democrats banded together this week to censure Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, for her statements about the Israel-Gaza war, they homed in on her embrace and defense of one pro-Palestinian slogan they called unacceptable: “from the river to the sea.” the phrase was “widely recognized as a genocidal call to violence to destroy the state of Israel.”
本周，众议院共和党人和一个坚定的民主党阵营联合起来，谴责密歇根州民主党众议员拉什达·特莱布关于以色列—加沙战争的言论，并把矛头指向了她对亲巴勒斯坦口号“从河流到大海”的拥护和捍卫，他们认为这个口号是不可接受的。这句话“被广泛视为呼吁以暴力摧毁以色列国的种族灭绝行为”。

The phrase, which Ms. Tlaib has defended as “an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction or hate” has not only become a flashpoint for dispute in Washington. The slogan reflects the geography of that original claim: Israel spans the narrow stretch of land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. They’re saying, ‘I identify with my ancestral home in Palestine, even if it’s not on a map today.’
特莱布为这句话辩护说，“这是对自由、人权与和平共处的热切呼吁，而不是呼唤死亡、破坏或仇恨”，这句话不仅成为华盛顿争论的导火索；这一口号反映了最初的主张涵盖的地理范围：以色列横跨约旦河和地中海之间的狭长地带。他们的意思是，‘我认同我祖先在巴勒斯坦的家园，即使它如今不在地图上。’

But the phrase has also been adopted over the years by Hamas, which calls for the annihilation of Israel, taking on a darker meaning that has long shaped the way in which it is received. Mr. Khalidi pointed out that Israel’s Likud party, which is led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, embraced a similar slogan in its original 1977 platform, which stated that, “between the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty.” That phrase also could be seen “as having a malign intent,” he said.
但这句话多年来也被呼吁消灭以色列的哈马斯所采用，为其赋予了一种更黑暗的含义，长期以来，这种含义一直影响着人们对它的接受。哈利迪指出，内塔尼亚胡总理领导的以色列利库德集团曾在1977年的初创纲领中提出类似的口号，称“在大海与约旦河之间只能存在以色列的主权”。他说，这句话也可能被视为“饱含恶意”。

The anecdote was significant, for it linked the executive order to an actual A.I. harm that everyone can understand — human impersonation. Another example is the recent boom in fake nude images that have been ruining the lives of high-school girls. 
他的调侃意味深长，将这项行政命令与一种人人都能理解的人工智能危害联系了起来，那就是冒充他人。另一个案例是近来泛滥的虚拟裸照，已经毁掉了许多高中女孩的生活。

With government sitting on the sidelines, social media technology evolved from a seemingly innocent tool for sharing personal updates among friends to a large-scale psychological manipulation, complete with a privacy-invasive business model and a disturbing record of harming teenagers, fostering misinformation and facilitating the spread of propaganda.
因为政府的袖手旁观，社交媒体技术从看似人畜无害的私人朋友圈更新工具演变为大规模心理操纵的手段，加之侵犯隐私的商业模式和伤害青少年、助长错误信息并推动洗脑灌输传播的黑历史，堪称五毒俱全。

America’s long-promised pivot to Asia was finally gathering momentum, But the Middle East, like a vortex, has pulled Washington back in. And two top cabinet officials will be crisscrossing Asia this week with messages of reassurance
美国承诺已久的转向亚洲战略终于增强势头，但中东的冲突已像漩涡那样将华盛顿拉了回去。两名内阁高级官员本周将前往亚洲各地传递安抚信息

Along the way, they most likely will hear a mix of views about Gaza, with India more supportive of Israel, Japan seeking a more balanced approach, and Indonesia, home of the world’s largest Muslim population, increasingly outraged by the thousands of civilians killed in the Israeli invasion that has followed Hamas’ assault on Israel.
访问期间，他们很可能会听到有关加沙的各种看法，印度更支持以色列，日本寻求更平衡的做法，而世界上穆斯林人口最多的国家印度尼西亚已对以色列在遭到哈马斯袭击后入侵加沙，造成数千名加沙平民丧生的情况越来越愤怒。

Guided munitions and more complex American systems are also being funneled to both conflicts, even as American partners in the Indo-Pacific wait for weapons deliveries of their own.If the Gaza war drags on, its impacts could change. But for skeptics of America’s commitment, wild swings in Washington’s attention are woven into the historical fabric. 
在美国的印太地区伙伴们等待他们订购的武器交付的时候，有制导能力的弹药和更复杂的美国系统正在涌向这两场冲突。如果加沙战争持续太久，其影响可能会发生变化。但对怀疑美国承诺的人来说，华盛顿注意力的剧烈摆动已是历史结构的一部分。

There is significant cynicism toward U.S. calls for Israeli restraint,In many ways, the Biden administration has a difficult job and has to bear the baggage of past U.S. policy, which makes it all the more important for the administration to get things right and show that it is trying hard to be even-handed.
对于美国呼吁以色列保持克制，人们持极大的怀疑态度，拜登政府在很多方面有艰巨的工作要做，不得不背着美国过去政策的包袱，这让拜登政府把事情做好，表明它在努力试着不偏不倚，变得更重要。

I can tell you that we are determined and we are, as we would say, running and chewing gum at the same time. The Indo-Pacific is the critical region for our future
我可以告诉你，我们已下定决心，正如我们所说，我们能同时处理不同的事情。印太地区是我们未来的关键地区。

It highlighted Mr. Biden’s appearing impressed after inspecting Mr. Xi’s Chinese-made Hongqi luxury car, and then waiting patiently in the driveway as the Chinese leader was chauffeured away.Mr. Biden’s off-the-cuff comment, in a response to a reporter’s question later,The summit caps a tumultuous year in U.S.-China relations
还专门给了拜登看到习近平乘坐的中国制造的红旗牌豪华轿车后似乎很钦佩的镜头，以及两人会面后，拜登站在车道旁边耐心地为这名中国领导人的专车送行的画面。拜登后来在回答记者提问时即兴发挥,两国元首的见面给美中关系动荡的一年划上了句号。

China is home to a thriving chemical industry that pumps out compounds that are made into pharmaceuticals, fragrances, textile dyes and fertilizers. Some of those same compounds can also be combined to create fentanyl, an opioid that can be 100 times as potent as morphine.The Chinese government denies that its country plays such a pivotal role and instead blames the United States for harboring a culture of drug use.
中国拥有强盛的化学工业，其生产的化合物可用于制造药品、香料、纺织染料和化肥。同样是这些化合物也可以用于合成芬太尼——一种阿片类药物，其效力是吗啡的100倍。中国政府否认本国扮演了如此关键的角色，并转而指责是美国在包庇毒品文化。

“In my 30 years as a customs official, the trafficking of synthetic illicit drugs like fentanyl is one of the toughest, most daunting challenges I have ever seen,” said Troy Miller, the acting commissioner for the customs agency.
“在我担任海关官员的30年里，芬太尼等合成非法药物的贩运是我见过的最棘手、最艰巨的挑战之一，”海关代理专员特洛伊·米勒说。

“I acknowledge there’s a disconnect between the numbers and how people feel about their place in the world right now,” Mr. Biden said. “We can deal with the second part as well.”
“我承认，这些数字和人们对自身处境的感觉之间存在脱节，”拜登说。“我们同样可以把后者给解决好。”

Mr. Xi spoke of pandas. He spoke of Ping-Pong. He spoke of Americans and Chinese working together during World War II to battle the Japanese. He addressed the tensions that have rocked U.S.-Chinese relations in the past year only briefly and obliquely, comparing the relationship to a giant ship that was trying to navigate through storms.
习近平提到了熊猫，也提到了乒乓球。他谈到了中美人民在“二战”期间共同抗击日本的努力。对于过去一年间动摇中美关系的紧张局势，他只是简略而模糊地带过，并将两国关系比作在狂风巨浪中航行的巨轮。

I think it’s important Americans and Chinese are meeting again face to face,This is not a magic bullet, but it is something that can provide possibilities that wouldn’t exist otherwise.Mr. Xi’s positive tone, and the enthusiasm of some of the event’s attendees, struck a sharp contrast with much of the recent conversation in the United States about China, which has focused on potential economic and security threats.
我认为中美双方能再次面对面交流的意义十分重大，这不是灵丹妙药，但确实能带来不这样做就不存在的可能性。习近平的积极口吻和部分与会者的热情与近来美国围绕中国议题的讨论形成了鲜明对比，这些讨论的重点是中国可能带来的经济和安全威胁。

In the ballroom, 34 tables were laid with roses and orchids. They were numbered 1 to 39, skipping any number with a four, which in Chinese sounds similar to death, as well as unlucky No. 13. Guests chose between a coffee-crusted Black Angus steak and vegetable curry with jasmine rice and toasted pistachios.
宴会厅里，34张桌子上摆着玫瑰和兰花。桌子的编号为一到39，任何带有四的数字都被跳过，因为“四”在汉语中与“死”谐音，不吉利的13号也被跳过。客人们可以选择裹了咖啡的黑安格斯牛排，或咖喱蔬菜配茉莉香米饭和烤开心果。

When they stand in front of an American, they tend to be more constructive and pro-American. It’s just part of what happens,
They’re not going to come to an event like this and put their thumb in the eye of us as the sponsors and the audience.While Biden spoke, Mr. Xi spent several minutes gazing into the distance.
当他们站在美国人面前时，他们往往更有建设性，更亲美。这只是事情的一部分，他们不会在参加这样的活动时，公然挑衅作为赞助商和观众的我们。拜登讲话时，习近平有那么几分钟一直凝视着远处。

The White House insisted that the dinner happen after Mr. Biden’s meeting with Mr. Xi on Wednesday, so as not to upstage that event.Mr. Biden, whose love of muscle cars is so well known that it has been skewered by the satirical news site The Onion, peeked inside Mr. Xi’s car, then gestured to his own ride, a squat armored Cadillac built like a rolling bunker.
白宫坚持要在拜登周三与习近平会面之后再举行晚宴，避免抢那次会面的风头。因为出了名地热爱“肌肉车”以至于招致讽刺新闻网站洋葱网嘲笑的拜登低头往习的车里看了一眼，然后朝自己的座驾比划了一下，也就是那辆彷如移动碉堡的凯迪拉克防弹车。

Filoli is a giant estate amid some of the most expensive real estate in the country, built in the early 20th century by a family that made its fortune in the California gold boom and wanted a retreat not far from San Francisco. William Bowers Bourn II, the original owner of the home, decided on the name “Filoli” by mixing together the first few letters of his personal motto: “Fight for a just cause. Love your Fellow Man. Live a Good Life.”
占地广阔的斐洛里庄园是美国最昂贵的地产之一，由一个在加州淘金热发了大财的家族在20世纪初兴建，为的是在距离旧金山不远的地方打造一处世外桃源。原主人威廉·鲍尔斯·伯恩二世将该庄园定名为“斐洛里”(Filoli)，取自他个人座右铭的首写字母：“为正义奋斗。爱你的同胞。造就美好生活。”(Fight for a just cause. Love your Fellow Man. Live a Good Life.)

Filoli, a grand house and garden on 654 acres of rolling green grounds along the California coast, has been a supporting character in the 1980s television drama “Dynasty” and the 2001 romantic comedy “The Wedding Planner.” It has been the venue for top-dollar nuptials of Facebook executives, and the public can tour the gardens.The site was appealing for a few reasons. It is set among the hills, one of the more isolated spots in a densely populated corner of California. 
斐洛里庄园坐落于加州海岸边绵延约265公顷的绿地之上，庄园里有富丽堂皇的房屋和花园。这里是上世纪80年代的电视剧《豪门恩怨》(Dynasty)和2001年上映的浪漫喜剧电影《婚礼专家》(The Wedding Planner)的取景地。Facebook高管曾于此举办奢华婚礼，公众也可以进入庭院参观。这里很适合两人会晤的原因有几点。它位于山区，是这个人口稠密的加州城市里较为僻静的地方之一。

During their lengthy meeting, the two leaders dined on herbed ricotta ravioli, artichoke crisps, tarragon-roasted chicken, rice pilaf, charred broccolini and almond meringue cake.After their meeting, Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi took a walk among the pomegranate trees and heather under gray California clouds. 
在这场耗时颇久的会面中，两位领导人享用了带有香草的意大利乳清奶酪饺子、洋蓟脆片、龙蒿烤鸡、抓饭、烤西兰苔和杏仁蛋白饼。在两人的会面之后，在加州阴云之下，拜登与习近平在石榴树和欧石楠丛中散步。

It is as if conflict between the two countries were something preordained, like an asteroid moving across a fixed path in the sky. But neither the United States nor China is a static entity; both are rapidly changing.
仿佛两国的冲突是命中注定，就像小行星沿着固定的轨迹掠过天空。然而无论美国还是中国都不是一个静态的实体，两者都在发生着迅速的变化。

America and its hawkish politicians must stop viewing China’s Communist-led system as some immutable, monolithic foe to be vanquished; intergenerational transformation in China is well underway. When I first moved to China in 2008 at age 21, most Americans still harbored clichéd images of China, of a faraway land where the masses clogged streets on their bicycles or toiled away manufacturing the world’s goods. Some of those old tropes are rooted in reality. China’s older generations were, in fact, builder generations like the Americans of the 1950s, laying down rules, roads and lines on the map en route to turning China into the world’s factory. By China’s own admission, it is still modernizing.
美国及其鹰派政治人物需要改变对中国的看法，不应一口咬定这个共产党领导的体系是某种不可变的、铁板一块的仇敌，必须迎头痛击。2008年21岁的我移居中国时，大多数美国人还怀着对中国的刻板印象，在遥远的地方有这么一片土地，人们要么在拥挤的街道上骑着自行车，要么闷着头为世界生产商品。其中有些老旧的说法是源于现实的。中国的老一代的确跟上世纪50年代的美国人一样，是建造者的一代，他们制定了将中国变成世界工厂的规则、道路和轮廓。中国自己都承认，它的现代化尚未完成。

But Nepal has rejected the designation of the airport as a Belt and Road project, because that label has complicated its diplomatic ties with India — its neighbor and rival to China for influence in the region. India, a major destination for Nepali travelers, has dragged its feet on approving flights to and from the airport.
但尼泊尔拒绝将这座机场囊括进“一带一路”规划，因为该倡议已令该国与印度的外交关系复杂化。印度是尼泊尔的邻国，也是与中国在该地区争夺影响力的对手。作为尼泊尔旅客的主要目的地，印度在批准航班在该机场起降的问题上一直拖延。

Philippine officials fear that when the ship falls apart, China will swoop in to claim the shoal, a submerged reef that is rich with fish and serves as a gateway to an area believed to contain vast reserves of oil and natural gas. 
菲律宾官员担忧中国会在这艘船解体之时迅速占领仁爱礁，这块暗礁下鱼类资源丰富，还是通往据信蕴藏着大量石油和天然气的地区的门户。

The speeches offer a new, unvarnished view into the leader at the center of a superpower rivalry that is shaping the 21st century. They show how at times he has voiced an almost fatalistic conviction — even before Beijing’s ties with Washington took a steep dive later in the Trump administration — that China’s rise would prompt a backlash from Western rivals seeking to maintain their dominance.The faster we develop, the bigger the external shock will be, and the greater the strategic blowback
这些讲话提供了一个未经修饰的新视角来了解这名处于超级大国竞争中心的领导人，而这场竞争正在影响着21世纪的进程。这些讲话表明，甚至在中美关系在后来的特朗普政府时期急剧下降之前，习近平有时就已在表达一种近乎宿命论的坚定信念，那就是，中国的崛起必将引起寻求维持主导地位的西方竞争对手的强烈反对。我们发展得越快，对外部的影响冲击就越大，受到的战略反弹力就越强

We have a thousand reasons to grow the relationship between China and the United States, and none at all to ruin it,But with mutual distrust running deep, any easing of antagonism between the two sides could be tenuous.‘governing by doing nothing,’letting everyone play to their strengths with less meddling.Flagrant corruption and official scandals had incensed many people. The internet opened up new channels for amplifying grievances.
我们有一千条理由把中美关系搞好，没有一条理由把中美关系搞坏，但由于双方的相互怀疑根深蒂固，两国对立情绪的任何缓和可能都很脆弱。‘无为而治’，发挥大家的长处，少干涉。骇人听闻的腐败和官员丑闻已激怒了许多人。互联网为放大这些不满提供了新渠道。

Some Western countries are fanning the flames there and secretly scheming to achieve their geopolitical goals there,We must take heed of this lesson.Speeches to people within the system are attempts to mobilize,You don’t do that by just saying that the world is getting a little bit complicated; you need a narrative that is going to allow you to smash vested interests to achieve change.
一些西方国家为了实现其地缘战略目标在那里煽风点火、密谋策划，”他说。“我们要引为镜鉴。体制内的讲话是为了把人们动员起来，要动员的话，就不能只是说世界正在变得有点复杂；需要一个能打破既得利益的叙事，才能实现改革。

In international contestation, political operations are very important, but ultimately it comes down to whether you have strength and whether you can use that strength,Relying on a silver tongue won’t work.
在国际较量中，政治运筹很重要，但说到底还是要看有没有实力，会不会用实力，光靠三寸不烂之舌是不行的。

The name is a nod to how numbing numbers can be. The higher the death toll, the less we are inclined to care, since the scale of human suffering can feel overwhelming. Statistics don’t trigger empathy and action. Personal stories do.Indeed some critics have called We Are Not Numbers an anti-Israeli organization. But the number of outlets that have been accused of bias in recent weeks has also diluted the impact of such criticism.
这个名字意指数字会令人变得麻木。死亡人数越多，我们就越不愿意关心，因为人类的苦难规模可能让人感到难以承受。统计数字不会引发共情和行动。然而个人故事却可以。事实上，一些批评人士称“我们不是数字”是一个反以色列组织。但最近几周，被指有偏见的媒体数量也削弱了此类批评的影响。

The Adidas team was huddled with Kanye West, pitching ideas for the first shoe they would create together. It was 2013, and the rapper and the sportswear brand had just agreed to become partners. The Adidas employees, thrilled to get started, had arrayed sneakers and fabric swatches on a long table near a mood board pinned with images.
阿迪达斯的团队围坐在坎耶·韦斯特面前，为他们将要共同打造的第一款鞋出谋划策。那是在2013年，这位说唱歌手和这家运动服饰品牌刚达成合作协议不久。阿迪达斯员工满怀激动地准备大展拳脚，他们在长桌上摆好了球鞋和面料样品，旁边是一块钉着图片的情绪板。

His complaints were often delivered amid mood swings, creating whiplash for the Adidas team working with him. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder, he at times rejected the assessment and resisted treatment.As Adidas grew more reliant on Yeezy sales, so did West. In addition to royalties and upfront cash, the company eventually agreed to another enticement
他的各种抱怨往往出现在情绪不稳定之时，给与他合作的阿迪达斯团队带来了很大的心理压力。他被诊断出双相情感障碍，但有时不肯承认并抗拒接受治疗。阿迪达斯愈发依赖Yeezy的销售额，韦斯特自己也是如此。除了抽成和预付现金，阿迪达斯最终还同意了他的另一项要求

Each fall, the flu emerges as a formidable force, spreading through the droplets produced when people cough, sneeze or talk, and sometimes hitching a ride to our noses by way of the infected surfaces that we touch. Influenza viruses cause tens of millions of illnesses and thousands of deaths in the United States each year.
每年秋天，流感都会强势出现，通过人们咳嗽、打喷嚏或说话时产生的飞沫传播，有时还会通过人们接触的受感染表面进入我们的鼻子。流感病毒每年在美国造成数千万人患病，数以千计人死亡。

Chinese officials have told their American counterparts they will not discuss arms control until they have parity with the other two nuclear superpowers. Mr. Biden is also expected to broach the war in Gaza with Mr. Xi,
中国官员告诉美国对等官员，与另外两个核超级大国平起平坐之前，他们不会讨论军备控制问题。预计拜登还将与习近平讨论加沙战争问题。

That is significant because the current Chinese climate goal addresses only carbon dioxide, leaving out methane, nitrous oxide and other gases that are acting as a blanket around the planet.Methane spews from oil and gas operations as well as coal mining and can be 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide in the short term.
这一点意义重大，因为中国目前的减排目标只涉及二氧化碳，不涉及甲烷、一氧化二氮和其他非二氧化碳温室气体。石油和天然气作业以及煤炭开采都会泄漏甲烷，它作为温室气体的效力在短期内可达二氧化碳的80%。

The government released a long-awaited blueprint last week for addressing methane, but analysts dismissed it as toothless because it lacked targets for emissions reductions.
虽然政府上周发布了外界期待已久的解决甲烷问题的蓝图，但分析人士认为该蓝图不起作用，因为缺乏减排目标。

Even the most flowery Chinese articles have drawn distinctions between warm ties between American and Chinese people, and their governments; some state media outlets have continued to warn that the outcome of the California meeting will hinge on the United States, in line with Beijing’s stance that the strained relationship is entirely Washington’s fault.
中方发表的文章即便说得再天花乱坠，也还是对美中人民的友好和两国政府的关系做出了区分。一些官媒继续警告，加州的会晤结果如何将取决于美国，这符合北京一贯的立场，即中美关系紧张的责任全在美方。

A lunch meeting about China this summer at the Upper East Side headquarters of the Council on Foreign Relations felt more like an Irish wake.Another told stories about living for years in Beijing as a translator, brand strategist and freelance music critic on a “dodgy visa” that the Chinese government would never give out today. They were all keenly aware that they had lived through an extraordinary period of warm relations that is now gone, perhaps forever.
今年夏天，在美国外交关系委员会位于上东区的总部举行的一场关于中国的午餐会，感觉更像是一场爱尔兰守灵仪式。有一个人讲述了他在北京生活多年的故事，他持着“不太正经的签证”做翻译、品牌策略师和自由乐评人，如今的中国政府肯定不会发那种签证了。他们都敏锐地意识到，他们经历了一段非同寻常的热络时期，现在那段时期已经过去，也许一去不复返了。

The nostalgia was poignant but the gathering was also notable for what it represented. That lunch meeting underlined the fact that China was turning into something they hadn’t expected — and slipping out of their reach. There was nothing to be done. It was out of their hands. A melancholy camaraderie filled the room. It felt like the end of an era.
怀旧之情令人心酸，但这次聚会也因其所代表的意义而引人注目。那次午餐会议凸显了这样一个事实——中国正在变成他们意想不到的东西，并且逐渐脱离他们所能触及的范畴。没有什么可做的。他们无能为力。房间里充满了忧郁的同志情谊。感觉像是一个时代的终结。

But the hard reality remains: The United States and China, the two most powerful nations in the world, are bound to butt heads in this new era and nobody knows how acrimonious it is going to get.China has gone from a poor country that was deeply insecure about its place in the world to one that is wealthy and confident
美国和中国，世界上最强大的两个国家，在这个新时代必然会发生冲突，没有人知道会变得多么激烈。中国已经从对自己的国际地位充满焦虑的穷国变成一个富有、自信的国家

If China has changed, so too has the United States. In the golden years of the relationship, the U.S. system of nearly unfettered capitalism and representative self-governance was a model for much of the world. Today it is a showcase of political sclerosis, reactionary populism and a nearly unbridgeable gap between rich and poor.
如果说中国已经变了，那么美国也是如此。在中美关系的黄金年代，美国几乎不加束缚的资本主义和代议制自治体制被全世界相当一部分地方视为榜样。如今它展现的是政治僵化、倒退的民粹主义和几乎无法弥合的贫富差距。

For more than a quarter century, the fortunes of the United States and China were fused in a uniquely monumental joint venture.Americans treated China like the mother of all outlet stores, purchasing staggering quantities of low-priced factory goods. Decades of American rhetoric that celebrated commerce as a wellspring of democratization in China have given way to resignation that the country’s current leadership
在超过四分之一个世纪的时间里，美国和中国的国运融合在了一家独特而宏伟的“巨型企业”中。美国人视中国为一切折扣店的源头，购买数量惊人的低价工厂产品。如今，美国已经放弃了过去几十年间宣扬商业乃中国民主化源泉的那套说辞，转而默认习近平主席领导下的中国领导层

In a perfect political world, these are two countries that are made in heaven, exactly because they are complementary,Essentially, these two countries kind of got married without knowing one another’s religions.But divorce is not a practical option. The United States and China — the world’s two largest economies — are intertwined. It was never going to last.Still, the prospect that their political schism will endure is altering global supply chains. 
在完美的政治世界里，这两个国家堪称天作之合，因为它们完全互补，从本质上讲，这两国就好比在不了解对方宗教信仰的情况下结了婚一样。但离婚却是个不现实的选项。作为世界上最大的两个经济体，美国和中国紧密相连。这种关系从来就不可能天长地久 尽管如此，两国的政治分裂将持续下去的前景正在改变全球供应链

Some trade and national security experts celebrate these shifts as an overdue adjustment to decades of growth propelled by a perilous codependency between the United States and China.It was certainly a form of interdependence,But the notion that China saves and the U.S. spends, China lends and the U.S. borrows, and all is good because we are two sides of the same coin, we’re complementary, that was never sustainable.
一些贸易和国家安全专家将这些变化称赞为对几十年经济增长模式早该发生的调整，那种增长是靠美中之间危险的相互依赖推动的。这当然是一种形式的相互依赖，但这里面的观念是不可持续的，那就是中国存钱、美国花钱，中国放贷、美国借款，这些都是好事，因为我们是同一事物的两个方面，我们是互补的。

Yet beneath such high-minded rhetoric, American brands pushed for greater access to China for the simple reason that its factories could turn out goods more cheaply than anywhere else.Walmart, a company ruled by a zeal for low prices, opened a procurement center in the boomtown of Shenzhen. The company would gather hundreds of representatives from surrounding factories. They would sit in wooden chairs, sipping tea out of flimsy plastic cups, as they waited for hours to meet Walmart’s buyers. The company could demand rock-bottom prices, aided by the implicit threat that if one factory balked, another could be summoned from inside the same waiting room.
但在如此高尚的言辞背后，美国的品牌想要更多地进入中国，原因很简单，因为中国的工厂能生产比其他地方更便宜的商品。沃尔玛是一家热衷于低价的公司，在新兴城市深圳建了一个采购中心。沃尔玛将周边工厂的数百名代表召集到这个中心。他们坐在木椅上，用一次性塑料杯喝着茶，一等就是几个小时。沃尔玛能要到最低的价格，因为隐含的威胁是，如果一家工厂犹豫的话，沃尔玛能从同一间等候室里召唤来另一家工厂的代表。

As the most powerful leader in generations, he rarely bothers to glad-hand or to try charming a crowd. His public appearances are carefully crafted, with fawning cadres and adoring fans positioned around him.The dinner itself was a polarizing affair
作为几代人以来最具权势的领导人，很少会费心去讨好或者取悦民众。他的公开露面都是经过精心安排的，周围全是阿谀奉承的领导干部和崇拜的粉丝。这场晚宴本身就是个争议话题

In his speech, Mr. Xi stuck mostly to friendly topics, comparing the U.S.-Chinese relationship to a tree that had “grown tall and strong,” and dangling the prospect of dispatching more giant pandas to California as “envoys of friendship.”
习近平的致辞基本只谈到了友好话题，将中美关系比作一棵“已经长大”的树，并提出愿意为加州送来更多“友谊使者”大熊猫。

In Shenzhen, a metropolis born of China’s economic prosperity, Paibang Village is a reminder of the city’s modest past and the challenges ahead for reviving the country’s property sector.Paibang is what China calls an urban village, a labyrinth of low-slung apartment buildings and mom-and-pop storefronts connected by a maze of alleyways and narrow roads. 
在深圳这个中国经济繁荣造就出的大都市，排榜村令人们想起这座城市朴实的过去，以及振兴中国房地产行业所面临的挑战。排榜村是中国所谓的城中村，由低矮的公寓楼和小小的夫妻店组成，被小巷和狭窄的道路连接起来，如同迷宫一般。

Now with China mired in an unyielding property crisis, policymakers want to revamp aging urban neighborhoods like Paibang to kick-start construction and spur local economies.But as the halting rehabilitation of Paibang shows, it will not be a quick or easy fix.All the while, construction in Paibang has been at a standstill. Rows of concrete apartment blocks stand so close to each other that they are colloquially known as “handshake buildings” to describe the proximity of the neighbors. The apartments are run-down: no elevators, bars on windows and squat toilets.
如今，随着中国陷入难以平息的房地产危机，政策制定者希望改造像排榜村这样老化的城市社区，以此启动建设，刺激当地经济。但是，排榜村改造陷入了停滞，这表明这并非一个快速或简单的解决方案。与此同时，排榜村的建设一直处于停滞状态。一排排的混凝土公寓楼靠得很近，俗称“握手楼”。这些公寓都很破：没有电梯，窗户上有栏杆，使用蹲式厕所。

The real estate slump is weighing on the economy. Local governments, reliant on land lease revenue, are feeling the squeeze.The government has tried cutting interest rates and loosening home-buying requirements but has not moved the needle. More drastic measures may weigh on local budgets when debt is already a problem.
房地产市场的低迷正在拖累经济。依赖土地租赁收入的地方政府感受到了压力。政府尝试降低利率和放宽购房条件，但于事无补。在债务已经成为问题的情况下，更严厉的措施可能会对地方预算造成压力。

As Chinese cities modernized into expanses of high-rises and gridded streets, the urban villages grew into chaotic, densely populated neighborhoods little touched by the gentrification surrounding them.Starting around 2009, as urban expansion started to run out of land, many local governments recognized the untapped potential of urban villages, and redeveloped neighborhoods. 
随着中国城市走向现代化，高楼林立，街道网格化，城中村逐渐发展为人口密集的混乱社区，周围的士绅化几乎与它们无关。从2009年左右开始，随着城市扩张开始耗尽土地，许多地方政府认识到，城中村具有尚未开发的潜力，并对这些社区进行重新开发。

Jimmy Carter, 99, the longest-living president in American history, has also been in hospice care at their home, but so far he has defied expectations. Over their nearly eight decades together, the Carters forged the closest of bonds, developing a personal and professional symbiosis remarkable for its sheer longevity.
现年99岁的吉米·卡特是美国历史上最长寿的总统，也一直在家中接受临终关怀，但到目前为止，他的表现出乎人们的意料。在近八十年的共同生活中，卡特夫妇建立了最亲密的关系，形成了一种个人和职业上的共生关系，其持久性令人瞩目。

Reared in the same tiny patch of Georgia farmland, 150 miles south of Atlanta, they were similar in temperament and outlook. They shared a fierce work ethic, a drive for self-improvement and an earnest, even pious, demeanor. Their Christian faith was central to their lives. Both were frugal. Both could be stubborn.
他们都是在亚特兰大以南240公里的一片佐治亚州农庄里长大，性情和观念都很相似。他们都有强烈的事业心、自我提升的动力，以及认真甚至虔诚的举止。基督教信仰是他们生活的中心。两人都很节俭。两人都可以很固执。

In the continuum of first ladies after Roosevelt, Carter broke the mold. Like most of the others, she championed a cause — hers was the treatment of mental illness. But she also immersed herself in the business of the nation and kept a sharp eye on politics, a realm her husband famously claimed to ignore.
在罗斯福之后的第一夫人中，罗莎琳·卡特打破了常规。像其他大多数第一夫人一样，她支持一项事业——她支持的是治疗精神疾病。但她也全身心地投入到国家事务中，并对政治保持着敏锐的关注，而她的丈夫曾以宣称忽视政治著称。

A full 16 years before Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton would offer themselves to the nation as a package deal with the slogan “Buy one, get one free,” the Carters functioned as near co-presidents.
卡特夫妇几乎是以联合总统的身份行事，这比以“买一送一”的口号打包向全国人民推销自己的比尔·克林顿和希拉里·罗德姆·克林顿早了整整16年。

A Crush From Afar, Rosalynn and Ruth conspired for years to get him to notice her, but after his fateful glimpse of her as a newborn, they had few encounters.The Smiths were not as well off as the Carters. Rosalynn was 13 when her father died of leukemia, Despite her hardships and obligations, she was valedictorian of her class at Plains High School. She later commuted to Georgia Southwestern College, then a junior college.
来自远方的迷恋,罗莎琳和露丝密谋了多年，想让他注意到她，但在他对初生的她做了命中注定的匆匆一瞥之后，两人就少有碰面的机会。史密斯家不如卡特家富裕。罗莎琳13岁时，父亲因白血病去世，尽管饱受艰辛，身负重任，她还是代表普莱恩斯高中的毕业生做了告别讲演。后来，她就读于佐治亚州西南学院，当时是一所大专学校。

Mr. Sutskever, Ms. Toner and Ms. McCauley are representative of the kinds of people who were heavily involved in thinking about A.I. a decade ago — an eclectic mix of academics, Silicon Valley futurists and computer scientists. They viewed the technology with a mix of fear and awe, and worried about theoretical future events like the “singularity,” a point at which A.I. would outstrip our ability to contain it. Many were affiliated with philosophical groups like the Effective Altruists, a movement that uses data and rationality to make moral decisions, and were persuaded to work in A.I. out of a desire to minimize the technology’s destructive effects.
苏茨克韦尔、托纳和麦考利可以代表十年前积极参与思考人工智能的那批人，他们是学者，硅谷未来学家和计算机科学家的混合体。他们对这项技术既恐惧又敬畏，并担心理论上的未来事件，比如“奇点”(singularity)，即人工智能超出我们的控制能力。许多人都属于有效利他主义者等哲学团体，这是一个利用数据和理性做出道德决定的运动，他们之所以决定从事人工智能工作，是出于将技术的破坏性影响降到最低的愿望。

Steve Jobs, driven by his genius and his gut, invented the iPhone and built Apple into the world’s most valuable company. He was uncompromising, larger than life and irreplaceable. His life was creating the future, which would be filled with devices controlled by their users.
在天才和直觉的驱动下，史蒂夫·乔布斯创造了iPhone，把苹果变成了世界上市值最高的公司。他从不妥协，行为惹眼，是个不可替代的人物。他一生都在创造未来，那是一个充满由用户控制的设备的未来。

For all the relentless exaltation of Mr. Altman over the weekend, the extravagant claims made by him and his former OpenAI colleagues will eventually have their own moment of reckoning. He learned there that turmoil always lurked underneath a promising new company. “Start-ups on the inside are always badly broken,” he said.Mr. Altman had the reputation of a swashbuckler.
尽管称赞奥尔特曼的声音周末没有减弱，但他和他在 OpenAI的前同事做过的那些不切实际的宣告终将面对算总账的时刻。他在那里学到的东西是，一家充满希望的新公司背后总潜藏着混乱。“初创企业的内部总有严重的坏毛病，”他说。奥尔特曼享有好斗的名声。

The best birthday gift the oldest president in American history could hope for would be a strategy for assuaging voters’ concerns, but that has been hard to come by.For President Biden, who turns 81 on Monday, another birthday may bring more liability than revelry, offering one more reminder of his age to an already skeptical electorate.
作为美国历史上年纪最大的总统，他所能期待的最好礼物就是一套缓解选民担忧的策略，但这并非易事。对于在周一迎来81岁生日的拜登总统来说，又一年生日所带来的与其说是欢乐，不如说是累赘，让本已心存疑虑的选民再次想起他的年龄。

While presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping were drawing the world’s attention for their talks in San Francisco this week, a different kind of summitry is happening in China. There, representatives from their two countries are speaking through violins, cellos, oboes and clarinets.
在旧金山举行的“习拜会”吸引了世界目光之际，一场迥然不同的盛会在中国上演。在这场盛会上，小提琴、大提琴、双簧管和单簧管成了两国代表的交流手段。

Many Swiss rely on perpetual refinancing to afford their homes. Switzerland is the land of luxury watches, fine chocolates — and lifelong mortgages. It’s not uncommon for borrowers to extend their loans until their deaths, which is advantageous from a tax perspective because mortgage interest is tax deductible. It also gives a lot of business to Switzerland’s vaunted banking industry.
许多瑞士人依靠永续性重新贷款来买房。瑞士以奢侈腕表、精致巧克力和终身抵押贷款闻名。还贷还到死情况并不罕见，这从纳税的角度讲是有利的，因为抵押贷款利息可以抵税。这种贷款还让瑞士引以为傲的银行业获得了大量业务。

The Chinese data indicated “no detection of any unusual or novel pathogens,” according to a W.H.O. statement on Thursday. The data, which included laboratory results from infected children, indicated that the rise in cases was a result of known viruses and bacteria, such as influenza and mycoplasma pneumoniae, a bacterium that causes usually mild illness.
世卫组织在周四发布的声明中写道，中国提供的数据“未检测到任何异常或新型病原体”。这些数据包括来自受感染儿童的实验室结果，表明病例的增加是由已知病毒和细菌造成的，例如流感和肺炎支原体（一种通常会引发轻微病症的细菌）。

Both times, officials covered up early cases, and stonewalled requests from health officials overseas, including the W.H.O., for more information and access to patient data.In domestic media, they have urged calm about the surge in respiratory illnesses, saying the increase is due in part to the lifting of China’s three years of strict coronavirus restrictions.Chinese doctors have said patients in this round appear to have mixed infections, or drug-resistant ones, which may be making symptoms worse.
官员们在那两次疫情期间都掩盖了早期病例，并阻碍了海外卫生官员，包括世卫组织的官员对分享更多信息和患者数据的要求。官员们在国内媒体的报道中呼吁人们对呼吸道疾病的激增保持冷静，称激增的部分原因是中国取消了曾严格执行三年的“新冠清零”政策。中国的医生们表示，这波患者中混合感染或耐药的较多，这可能会导致病情恶化。

I confess I have a history of going into these tech workplaces with a degree of defensive humanistic snobbery: These people may know code, I tell myself, but they probably don’t know the literary and philosophical things that really matter.
我承认，过去我走进这些科技公司的时候，会摆出一种防御性的人本主义架子：我告诉自己，这些人可能懂代码，但他们可能不懂真正重要的文学和哲学。

It would have been another shocking twist in a saga that was already full of them. Billions of dollars — and, possibly, the trajectory of the entire A.I. industry — hung on the fate of the board’s decision, and many expected it to cave under pressure and reverse itself.
这原本会给一个本已充满峰回路转的复杂故事再添惊人转折。数十亿美元——可能还有整个人工智能行业的发展轨迹——都取决于董事会的决定，许多人预计董事会将在压力下屈服，撤销之前的决定。

It was in the middle of a tender offer that would have allowed employees to cash out their stock at an eye-watering valuation, and its cutting-edge A.I. language model, GPT-4, was best in class.Now, the company is in chaos. Its top leaders are gone. Morale is shattered. The tender offer may fall apart. OpenAI’s board may be satisfied with this outcome — after all, the board chose it, even after being given a chance to backtrack.
当时，该公司正在进行一项收购要约，该要约将允许员工以令人咋舌的估值兑现其股票，而它的尖端人工智能语言模型GPT-4在同类产品中是最好的。现在，公司陷入混乱。它的最高领导人已经离开了。士气低落。要约收购可能会以失败告终。OpenAI董事会可能会对这个结果感到满意——毕竟，董事会选择了这个结果，即使他们有机会反悔。

Mr. Nadella would have clearly preferred to see Mr. Altman reinstated.But when it was clear that wasn’t happening, he did the next best thing: swooping in to offer jobs to Mr. Altman, Mr. Brockman and their loyalists.Strategically, it was a masterstroke. Winners: A.I. Doomers and Effective Altruists. Mr. Altman’s firing startled the tech industry and OpenAI’s investors, OpenAI has been the gravitational center of that discussion along with its former chief executive
纳德拉显然更希望看到奥尔特曼复职。但当这一切显然不可能发生时，他做了退而求其次的选择：向奥尔特曼、布罗克曼及其忠实拥护者提供工作机会。从战略上讲，这是一个神来之笔。赢家：人工智能末日论者和有效利他主义者,奥尔特曼遭革职震惊了科技行业,过去一年里，奥尔特曼在让人工智能成为主流话题方面做了比任何人都多的努力

People with these fears — sometimes mocked as “doomers” or “decels” by their critics — were once considered fringe. And on Friday, they took down the chief executive of the world’s leading A.I. company.Many of these investors are techno-optimists who believe that A.I. will be an unalloyed good for society
有这些恐惧的人——有时被批评者嘲笑为“末日论者”或“衰退者”——一度被认为是边缘人群。上周五，他们扳倒了世界顶级人工智能公司的首席执行官。这些投资者中的许多人都是技术乐观主义者，他们相信人工智能将为社会带来纯粹的好处

On one hand, companies like Google, Anthropic and Meta could benefit from a weakened OpenAI if it allows them to catch up to the company’s A.I. progress, or siphon off key employees. The board of directors of OpenAI, the high-flying artificial intelligence start-up, said in a note to employees on Sunday night that its former chief, Sam Altman, would not be returning to his job.Hours later, in another head-spinning move, Microsoft said it was hiring Mr. Altman and Greg Brockman
一方面，谷歌、Anthropic和Meta等公司可能会从OpenAI的削弱中受益，如果这能让它们在人工智能方面追上OpenAI的进展，或者挖走OpenAI的关键员工。周日晚，大获成功的人工智能初创公司OpenAI的董事会在发给员工们的一份备忘录中表示，公司前任首席执行官萨姆·奥尔特曼不会重返工作岗位,几小时后，微软也做出了一个使人眩晕的举动，宣布将奥尔特曼和曾任OpenAI总裁的公司联合创始人格雷格·布罗克曼招至麾下

Some OpenAI employees pledged to quit OpenAI or join Mr. Altman’s new potential venture if the board did not relent. Microsoft led the charge, three people said, and smaller investors channeled their concerns through Microsoft.In 2018, after Mr. Musk parted ways with OpenAI, Mr. Altman transformed the lab into a for-profit company that is controlled by the nonprofit and its board.
一些OpenAI员工已正式承诺，如果董事会不作出让步，他们将退出OpenAI，或加入奥尔特曼可能成立的新公司。三名知情人士说，微软在其中起了带头作用，较小的投资者们则通过微软表达了他们的担忧。2018年，马斯克与OpenAI分手后，奥尔特曼将实验室转变为一家由非营利组织及其董事会控股的营利性公司。

Mr. Shear, a longtime video gamer, was viewed as a competent leader at Twitch but had his critics. He was perceived to be too focused on cost-cutting and turning the money-losing site into a more profitable business.
长期爱玩电子游戏的希尔在Twitch工作时曾被视为一名称职的领导者，但也不乏批评者。人们认为他过于关注削减成本以及把亏损的网站转变为更盈利的生意。

Javier Milei was first introduced to the Argentine public as a combative television personality with an unruly hairdo and a tendency to insult his critics. So when he entered Argentina’s presidential race last year, he was viewed by many as a sideshow.Many Argentines awoke on Monday anxious, others hopeful, but just about everyone was uncertain about what lay ahead.“Argentina’s situation is critical,” he said. “The changes that our country needs are drastic. There is no place for gradualism.”
哈维尔·米莱最初是以一个好斗电视明星的形象出现在阿根廷公众面前的，他发型不羁，喜欢侮辱批评他的人。因此，当他去年参加阿根廷总统竞选时，很多人认为他只是个配角。周一，许多阿根廷人醒来时感到焦虑，也有人满怀希望，但几乎所有人都不确定未来会发生什么。“阿根廷的情况非常危急，”他说。“我们国家需要的改变是剧烈的。循序渐进是行不通的。”

He identifies as an “anarcho-capitalist,” which, he has said, is a radically free-market strain of libertarianism that believes “society functions much better without a state than with a state.”It’s true that he has the handicap of inexperience,but I’m hopeful that he can put together a reasonable governing team to make the changes the country needs.
他认为自己是“无政府资本主义者”，他说，这是自由意志主义的一种激进的自由市场流派，认为“没有国家的社会比有国家的社会运转得更好”。他存在没有经验这个缺陷，这是事实，但我觉得他有希望组织起一个通情达理的治理团队，给这个国家带来它需要的改变。

While many key people in Mr. Milei’s campaign also lack much governing experience, they have pitched that as an asset, not a liability, and many voters agreed.Ms. Milei has been an enigma in Argentina, always present at Mr. Milei’s side but almost never speaking publicly. In a 2021 television interview, he even compared her to Moses, the biblical figure bearing the message of God. “Kari is Moses,” he said with tears in his eyes. “I’m the one spreading the word.”
米莱竞选团队中的许多关键人物也缺乏治理经验，然而这被他们当做优势而不是缺陷来宣传，许多选民认同这一点。卡丽娜·米莱在阿根廷是个神秘人物，总是在米莱左右，但几乎从未公开发言过。在2021年的一次电视采访中，他甚至将她比作摩西，也就是那位带来了上帝福音的圣经人物。“卡丽是摩西，”他双眼含泪地说。“我只是负责传播的人。”
