This week, though, the two parties — which both argue that they are better able to ensure peace with China — chose in spectacular fashion to go to war against each other. An incipient deal for a joint presidential ticket between the long-established Nationalist Party and the upstart Taiwan People’s Party unraveled with the speed, melodrama and lingering vitriol of a celebrity wedding gone wrong.Mr. Gou, who had also thrown his hat in the ring, withdrew from the race.
然而，这两个在野党上周却以令人惊叹的方式选择了相互开战，它们都信誓旦旦，自称更有能力确保与中国的和平。历史更为悠久的国民党与新兴的台湾民众党联合起来参加总统大选的初步协议，以名人婚礼出了状况的那种速度、戏剧性和迟迟不去的尖刻无情崩溃了。曾宣布参选的郭台铭也退出了大选。

For now, many Taiwanese people seem absorbed — sometimes gleeful, sometimes anguished — by the spectacle of recent days. “Wave Makers,” a recent Netflix drama series, showed Taiwanese electoral politics as a noble, if sometimes cutthroat, affair. This week was more like the political satire “Veep.”
就目前而言，许多台湾人似乎被最近几天的情况所吸引，时而高兴，时而痛苦。虽然网飞不久前有一部台剧《造浪者》将台湾的选举政治表现得崇高，尽管有时也很残酷，但上周的情况更像是政治讽刺美剧《副总统》

“Émigré,” a new oratorio about Jewish refugees who fled Nazi Germany for Shanghai in the late 1930s, begins with a song by two brothers, Josef and Otto, as their steamship approaches a Chinese harbor.“Shanghai, beacon of light on a silent shore,” they sing. “Shanghai, answer these desperate cries.”
新的清唱剧《上海！上海！》（英文名Émigré）讲述的是20世纪30年代末逃离纳粹德国的犹太难民前来上海避难的故事。故事以约瑟夫和奥托两兄弟的一首歌开始，他们乘坐的轮船正在靠近中国港口。“上海，无声海岸上的灯塔，”他们唱道。“上海，这些绝望叫声的回答。”

They have bought gold bars small enough to be scattered unobtrusively through carry-on luggage, as well as large stacks of foreign currency.Money sluicing out of China has weakened the currency, the renminbi, against the dollar and other currencies. And that weakness of the renminbi has helped sustain China’s exports, which support tens of millions of Chinese jobs.
他们购买了小到可以不起眼地分散在随身行李中的金条，以及大量外币。流出中国的资金削弱了人民币对美元和其他货币的汇率。人民币的疲软有助于维持中国的出口，而出口支撑着中国数千万的就业岗位。

The American efforts to scrutinize and restrict the activities of G42 are emblematic of the murky world in which U.S. spy agencies operate in their broader espionage shadow war with China. As the superpower rivalry intensifies, U.S. policymakers are relying on intelligence collection and analysis to help head off China’s efforts to make technological advances that would erode America’s military edge.
美国审查和限制G42活动的努力象征着美国间谍机构与中国展开更广泛间谍暗战的阴暗世界。随着超级大国之间的竞争加剧，美国政策制定者正依靠情报收集和分析来帮助阻止中国取得削弱美国军事优势的技术进步。

And the U.S. efforts to put G42 under a microscope show how difficult it is for intelligence agencies to discern whether a foreign company with commercial ties to China has links to that country’s military or its security and intelligence agencies.
美国将G42置于显微镜下的努力表明，情报机构很难辨别一家与中国有商业关系的外国公司是否与中国军方或安全和情报机构有联系。

The trickle became a steady stream: For nearly the past two decades, Chinese students have made up the largest share of international students in the United States.Students have been an anchor in the two countries’ relations, even when political or economic ties have soured.We’re going to play catch-up, to our detriment, unless we act really quickly
涓涓细流变成了源源不断的人流：在过去的近20年里，中国留学生一直在美国的国际学生中占比最大。即使中美之间的政治或经济关系已经恶化，留学生一直在两国关系中起一种稳定作用。除非我们真正迅速行动起来，我们将不得不努力追赶，这对我们不利

In filing confidentially for an initial public offering, Shein, the ultrafast-fashion retailer, is showing ambition on two fronts.The company and its underwriters are betting that investors will be more receptive to I.P.O.s, even though high-profile market debuts this fall largely fizzled out. Shein is also testing whether it can endure what’s likely to be an increase in political heat on the China-founded e-commerce giant.
超快时尚零售商希音以保密方式提交首次公开募股(IPO)申请，显示出了两方面的雄心。该公司及其承销商认为，投资者将对IPO持更为接受的态度，尽管今年秋天高调上市的公司基本上都以失败告终。此外，作为一家在中国成立的电子商务巨头，希音还在测试自己能否承受可能面临的政治压力。

Bankers had hoped that the long-moribund market for new listings would reopen this fall with offerings from the chip designer Arm, the grocery delivery service Instacart and the sandal maker Birkenstock. Instead, those debuts quickly busted.
银行家们曾希望，随着芯片设计公司Arm、杂货配送服务公司Instacart和凉鞋制造商Birkenstock的上市，沉寂已久的新股上市市场会在今年秋天重启。然而，这些IPO很快就失败了。

First the trucks arrived, carrying armed men toward the mist-shrouded mountaintop. Then the flames appeared, sweeping across a forest of towering pines and oaks.After the fire laid waste to the forest last year, the trucks returned. This time, they carried the avocado plants taking root in the orchards scattered across the once tree-covered summit where townspeople used to forage for mushrooms.
最先来的是卡车，载着武装人员向薄雾笼罩的山顶进发。山火接踵而至，吞噬了大片高耸的松树和橡树林。在去年的大火将森林烧毁之后，卡车又回来了。这一次，它们运来的牛油果树在果园里生根，这样的果园散布在曾经满是苍翠的山顶各处，镇上的人过去常常到这里采蘑菇。

In western Mexico, forests are being razed at a breakneck pace and while deforestation in places such as the Amazon rainforest or Borneo is driven by cattle ranching, gold mining and palm oil farms, in this hot spot, it is fueled by the voracious appetite in the United States for avocados.
在墨西哥西部，森林正在被飞速夷为平地。虽然亚马孙雨林或婆罗洲等地的森林采伐是由牛场、金矿和棕榈油农场驱动的，但此地大肆毁林的问题却是由美国对牛油果的海量需求造成的。

Charles Munger, who quit a well-established law career to be Warren Buffett’s partner and maxim-spouting alter-ego as they transformed a foundering New England textile company into the spectacularly successful investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, died Tuesday in Santa Barbara, California. He was 99.
查理·芒格于周二在加州圣巴巴拉去世，享年99岁。他放弃了已功成名就的律师事业，成为沃伦·巴菲特的合伙人和金句频出的挚友，两人联手将一家江河日下的新英格兰纺织公司转型为无比成功的投资公司伯克希尔·哈撒韦。

What you have to learn is to fold early when the odds are against you,or if you have a big edge, back it heavily, because you don’t get a big edge often, so seize it when it does come.
你必须学会的是在形势不利的情况下及早认输，而如果有大牌在手，就要下重注，因为你不常拿到大牌。机会出现，但不是经常的事，所以一旦它降临就要紧紧抓住。

Few diplomats have been both celebrated and reviled with such passion as Mr. Kissinger. Considered the most powerful secretary of state in the post-World War II era, he was by turns hailed as an ultrarealist who reshaped diplomacy to reflect American interests and denounced as having abandoned American values, particularly in the arena of human rights, if he thought it served the nation’s purposes.
很少有外交官能像基辛格那样毁誉都如此强烈。他被认为是“二战”后权力最大的美国国务卿，时而被赞颂为一个为美国利益重塑外交政策的终极务实者，时而又被谴责在自认为有利于国家时会抛弃美国价值观，特别是在人权问题方面。

The Biden administration has been trying to jump-start the domestic supply chain for electric vehicles so cleaner cars can be made in the United States. If we were to start the project up today, we would be hemorrhaging cash.The administration faces a tricky calculation with the new rules.
拜登政府一直在努力启动美国国内的电动汽车供应链，在美国生产更清洁的汽车。如果我们今天投产，将会损失大量资金,拜登政府在进一步明确新规则时，面临棘手的考量。

If it allows more companies to qualify for the benefits, Americans will have a wider choice of low-cost electric vehicles to choose from. That would put more clean cars on the road and help to mitigate climate change. It could also help to shore up the finances of U.S. automakers that are losing heavily on electric vehicle production.
如果政府允许更多公司生产的电动汽车享受税收抵免资格，美国人将有更多便宜的电动汽车可供选择。这将让更多人用上清洁汽车，有助于缓解气候变化。它还可能有助于提振在电动汽车生产方面亏损严重的美国汽车制造商的财务状况。

China dominates production of materials, like graphite and processed lithium, that are essential to the flow of electricity within a battery, and to the cathodes and anodes, the basic building blocks of a battery. 
中国主导着石墨和加工锂等材料的生产，这些材料对电池中的电流流动、以及电池的主要部件阴极和阳极至关重要。

Knowing him as they did, the Chinese played to his sense of self regard during his visit in July. They feted and flattered him. They put him up in the same guest quarters he had occupied during his historic visits in the 1970s. They hosted meetings in the same building where he had met their predecessors.Mr. Kissinger returned home and dutifully filled in Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken by phone; met with William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director; and passed along his impressions to Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser.
出于对他的了解，中国在他7月的访问期间迎合了他的自尊。他们款待他、奉承他，把他安排在上世纪70年代进行历史性访问时住过的客房里。他们在他会见前任中国领导人的同一幢楼里进行会面。基辛格回国后，尽职尽责地给国务卿布林肯打了电话，会见了中情局局长伯恩斯，并把他的印象转达给了国家安全顾问沙利文。

Kissinger’s life mission was to help create and maintain order in an international system that was always threatening to spin out of control.He traveled the globe at an age when most of his contemporaries had either died or retreated to a retirement home. There were few if any doors in capitals around the world that did not open to him.It’s nothing short of remarkable.Mr. Kissinger’s enduring presence in the halls of power, even with a visitor’s pass, stood out.
基辛格一生的使命是在一个随时可能失控的国际体系中帮助建立和维持秩序，他的同龄人不是已经去世就是退居养老院，而他还在周游世界。在世界各国的首都，几乎没有一扇大门不向他敞开.这简直是太了不起了,基辛格在权力的殿堂里经久不衰，即使他是持访客通行证进入，也很引人注目。

“Few people were better students of history — even fewer people did more to shape history — than Henry Kissinger,” Mr. Blinken said while in Israel emulating Kissingerian shuttle diplomacy.While he was readily given visitor’s passes to the halls of power, he was still reviled by many liberals as a war criminal and by many conservatives as an appeaser.But even if critics were laying into him, at least they were listening. Mr. Kissinger always wanted to be paid attention to.
布林肯在以色列模仿基辛格的穿梭外交时说：“很少有人在以史为鉴方面比得上基辛格，而在塑造历史方面，更是没有几个人能超越他。”虽然他很容易获得进入权力大厅的通行证，但他仍被许多自由派人士斥为战犯，被许多保守派人士斥为绥靖者。但是，尽管被批评者大骂，这至少意味着他们是在听的。基辛格一直希望得到关注。

And he could be characteristically Machiavellian even into his 90s. When Donald J. Trump came to power, Mr. Kissinger advised nervous German officials seeking reassurance about the new president to meet with Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser. But unknown to the Germans, Mr. Kissinger had told Mr. Kushner that the allies were nervous about Mr. Trump and that he should use that to his own advantage. Don’t reassure them, he advised — keep them on edge.Still, he was indefatigable. 
即便年逾九十，基辛格可能仍是典型的马基雅维利主义者。特朗普上台后，紧张的德国官员对于这位新总统颇为担忧，基辛格建议他们与特朗普的女婿兼高级顾问库什纳会面。但德国人不知道的是，基辛格已经告诉库什纳，盟国都对特朗普感到不安，但特朗普应该好好利用这一点。他的建议是，别安抚他们，就让他们如坐针毡。无论怎样，他不知疲倦。

The most harrowing part of their journey was trekking through the brutal jungle in Panama known as the Darién Gap. On the first day, said Mr. Gao, 39, he had sunstroke. The second day, his feet swelled. Dehydrated and weakened, he threw away his tent, a moisture-resistant sleeping pad and his change of clothes.
行程中最恐怖的部分是徒步穿越巴拿马名为“达连峡谷”的险恶丛林。39岁的高先生说，上路的第一天他就中暑了。第二天，他的脚肿了。由于脱水和没有力气，他只得扔掉帐篷、防潮睡垫和换洗衣服。

In 2018, the local government wanted the land back for development. Mr. Gao refused. The authorities cut water and electricity and pumped toilet sewage into the yard, forcing the tenants to leave. He won a lawsuit he brought against the government but received no compensation. For the next few years, Mr. Gao did odd jobs, spending most of his time on his petition and studying law. 
2018年，当地政府要将土地收回用于开发。高先生拒绝了。当局对楼断水断电，并将厕所污水抽进院子，迫使住户离开。他赢得了针对政府的行政诉讼，但没拿到任何赔偿。接下来的几年里，高先生靠打零工谋生，把大部分时间花在上访和学习法律上。

It’s worth unpacking what that means. A country that sustained a birthrate at that level would have, for every 200 people in one generation, 70 people in the next one, a depopulation exceeding what the Black Death delivered to Europe in the 14th century. Run the experiment through a second generational turnover, and your original 200-person population falls below 25. Run it again, and you’re nearing the kind of population crash caused by the fictional superflu in Stephen King’s “The Stand.”
我们应对这一现状进行深入剖析。如果一个国家的出生率维持在这样的水平，那就意味着这一代中的200人到下一代只会剩下70人，这比14世纪黑死病在欧洲造成的人口锐减还要厉害。当把这70人的一代再来一轮更替，原来的200人只剩下不到25人。再来一轮，差不多就是斯蒂芬·金在小说《末日逼近》(The Stand)里虚构的超级流感来袭时人口崩溃的场面了。

This is not to say that it will, since there are a number of patterns that set South Korea apart. For instance, one oft-cited driver of the Korean birth dearth is a uniquely brutal culture of academic competition, piling “cram schools” on top of normal education, driving parental anxiety and student misery, and making family life potentially hellish in ways that discourage people from even making the attempt.
这不一定是必然，因为韩国社会确实有许多独特之处。比如经常被提及的导致韩国生育率低的一个原因是其独特的残酷学业竞争文化，在常规教育之外还有无数“补习班”，导致家长的焦虑和学生的痛苦，可能将家庭生活变得像地狱一样，以至于许多人宁愿不要孩子。

Shari Mendes, a member of an Israeli military reserve unit tasked with preparing the bodies of fallen female soldiers for burial, said her team saw several who were killed on Oct. 7 “who were shot in the crotch, intimate parts, vagina, or were shot in the breast.” Others had mutilated faces, or multiple gunshots to their heads.
以色列预备役军人夏莉·门德斯负责给阵亡女兵的遗体做下葬前的准备，她说她的团队看到在10月7日被杀害的人有许多“在胯部、私处、阴道中弹，或胸部中弹”。还有的面部残缺，或头部多处中枪。

China’s housing boom was the biggest the world has seen, and Evergrande’s rise was powered by rapacious expansion, the system that stoked it and foreign investors who threw money at it. When China’s housing bubble burst, no other company imploded in as spectacular a fashion.The scale of Evergrande’s rise was staggering. For three decades, it wielded power in Beijing and in cities and towns thousands of miles away. 
中国曾经拥有繁荣的房地产市场，其规模之大在世界上史无前例，恒大成为中国最大的房地产开发商靠的是贪婪的扩张、刺激它发展的体制，以及为其投入巨资的外国投资者。当中国房地产市场泡沫破灭时，没有公司像恒大那样以令人惊叹的方式突然崩溃。恒大扩张的规模之大令人难以置信。30年来，它在北京以及千里之外的城镇叱咤风云。

Today Evergrande remains in default, unable to pay its debts but not officially defunct. Its stock trades for pennies a share. On Monday, a legal attempt to force its liquidation was prolonged: A judge adjourned a hearing in a lawsuit seeking to formally dismantle the sprawling company to pay back some of the investors who lost money.
今天，恒大仍处于违约状态，无力偿还债务，但还没有被正式清算。股票的交易价只剩下几美分。周一，强制恒大清盘的法律努力被推迟：一名法官延期了损失惨重的投资者对这家规模庞大的公司提出的诉讼案的听证，他们希望通过对恒大进行正式清算拿回部分损失

By the time Evergrande started selling stock to the public in Hong Kong in 2009, it had already faced questions about its voracious expansion. Foreign investors, many of them American private equity funds, hedge funds and Wall Street banks, had shoveled money into real estate companies a few years earlier, and the debt was piling up. 
恒大集团2009年在香港上市时，公司已经面临着关于其疯狂扩张的质疑。外国投资者（其中许多是美国私募股权基金、对冲基金和华尔街银行）几年前就对中国的房地产企业投了大量资金，使这些公司的债务高涨。

But in China, after a short and steep downturn, the government pumped $500 billion into building roads and railways, juicing growth and allowing China to emerge from the crisis before other countries. Soon economists were warning that China’s housing market was overpriced, supply was overbuilt and its developers were overleveraged.
在经历了短暂且急剧的经济衰退后，中国政府拿出了4万亿投资计划，通过公路和铁路建设刺激经济增长，让中国先于其他国家摆脱了危机。不久就有经济学家警告，中国房地产市场的价格过高、供应过剩，开发商借贷过多。

But things did go wrong. Over the last decade, the authorities have tried to rein in lending, but real estate companies found ways around each restriction, sometimes cutting corners on apartments, other times moving debts off their balance sheets. Eventually, a policy in 2020 that made it harder to borrow started to tip developers over the precipice.Evergrande’s collapse was just one domino in a falling line.
但的确出了问题。过去十年来，虽然当局一直在试图控制借贷规模，但房地产公司找到了绕过所有限制的办法，有时在公寓建设上偷工减料，有时将债务从资产负债表上转移出去。最终，2020年的一项政策加大了借贷难度，开始将开发商推到了悬崖边上。恒大的崩溃引发多米诺骨牌效应。

Qiushi is the main journal providing pronouncements on China’s current ideology, which is known as Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The statement on Friday said that Mr. Xi’s speech to the financial conference, “is a valuable ideological crystallization formed by our party’s unremitting exploration of the path of financial development with Chinese characteristics.”
《求是》是阐述中国当前意识形态——即“习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想”——的主要刊物。上周五发表的这篇文章宣称，习近平在中央金融工作会议上的讲话是“我们党不懈探索中国特色金融发展之路形成的宝贵思想结晶”。

Elon Musk celebrated his 44th birthday in July 2015 at a three-day party thrown by his wife at a California wine country resort dotted with cabins. It was family and friends only, with children racing around the upscale property in Napa Valley.And artificial intelligence had pierced the public consciousness only a few years before, when it was used to identify cats on YouTube — with 16% accuracy.
2015年7月，埃隆·马斯克庆祝了自己44岁生日，他的妻子在加州一个酒庄度假村里为其举办了一场持续三天的派对。受邀的都是家人和朋友，这个位于纳帕谷的高档酒店由许多木屋客房组成，孩子们在里面奔跑嬉戏。而就在几年前，人工智能才刚刚进入公众视野，曾被用于在YouTube上识别猫，准确率为16%。

But the tone that clear night soon turned contentious as the two debated whether AI would ultimately elevate humanity or destroy it.As the discussion stretched into the chilly hours, it grew intense, and some of the more than 30 partyers gathered closer to listen. Page, hampered for more than a decade by an unusual ailment in his vocal cords, described his vision of a digital utopia in a whisper. Humans would eventually merge with artificially intelligent machines, he said. One day there would be many kinds of intelligence competing for resources, and the best would win.If that happens, Musk said, we’re doomed. The machines will destroy humanity.
但在那个晴朗的夜晚，谈话的气氛很快变得激烈起来，人工智能最终是促进人类进步还是毁灭人类，两人在这个问题上产生了分歧。随着深夜寒意渐起，讨论的气氛变得越来越热络，30多名参加派对的人聚拢在一旁听他们谈话。十多年来，佩奇的声带一直受到一种不寻常的疾病困扰，他低声描述了自己对数字乌托邦的愿景。他说，人类最终将与人工智能机器融合。总有一天，将会出现多种智能争夺资源的情景，强者生存。如果出现了这种情况，马斯克说，我们就完蛋了。机器将毁灭人类。

Musk and Page stopped speaking soon after the party that summer. A few weeks later, Musk dined with Altman, who was then running a tech incubator, and several researchers in a private room at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park, California.“There is disagreement, mistrust, egos,” Altman said. “The closer people are to being pointed in the same direction, the more contentious the disagreements are. You see this in sects and religious orders. There are bitter fights between the closest people.”The drama inside OpenAI gave the world its first glimpse of the bitter feuds among those who will determine the future of AI.
那个夏天的派对结束后不久，马斯克和佩奇就不再来往了。几周后，在加州门洛帕克瑰丽酒店的一个包间里，马斯克与当时正在经营一家科技孵化器的奥尔特曼以及几位研究人员共进晚餐。“有分歧、不信任和自负的原因，”奥尔特曼说。“人们越是朝着相同的方向前进，分歧就越大。在宗教团体和教派中也是如此。最亲近的人之间往往吵得越凶。”OpenAI内部的闹剧让世人第一次看到了那些将决定人工智能未来的人之间的激烈争斗。

But that goal has collided with the rising aspirations of Chinese parents who have shown less interest in sending their children to vocational high schools to learn the skills of an electrician, a machinist or another technician.Factory jobs are often associated with the ‘three D’s’ — dirty, dangerous and demeaning.Companies in China have been slower than those in some countries, like Germany, to set up long-term apprentice programs to train future factory floor leaders.
但这一目标与中国父母对子女的未来期待越来越高是相悖的，他们没那么愿意把孩子送到职高学习电工、机械师或其他工种的技术。工厂岗位往往与‘三个D’联系在一起——肮脏(dirty)、危险(dangerous)和低端(demeaning)与德国等一些国家相比，中国企业在设立长期学徒项目方面一直比较落后，这些项目旨在为工厂车间培养未来负责人。

The demand rose so quickly that the education system was caught flat-footed, and it takes a few years to adequately prepare and train top-notch technicians,
A steepening decline in birthrates adds to the urgency of the challenge.China, and particularly the electric car industry, is trying to use automation to address its shortage of willing hands.
用工需求增长如此之快，以至于教育系统来不及反应，要充分做好一流技术人员的储备和培训工作需要花上数年时间，出生率的急剧下降则让这一挑战变得更加紧迫。整个中国都在试图利用自动化来应对劳动力短缺的问题，电动汽车行业尤甚

Even in exile and in faltering health, she continued to speak out about the hundreds of villages — especially in her home province, Henan, in central China — where residents flocked to sell blood at collection stations whose slipshod methods caused tens of thousands of deaths, if not more, from AIDS.
即使流亡在外，健康状况不佳，她仍继续为数百个村庄发声，尤其是在她的家乡——中国中部的河南省，那里的居民成群结队地前往采血站卖血，而采血站粗劣的采血方法，导致数万乃至可能更多的人死于艾滋病。

Dr. Gao, a diminutive woman with a crackling laugh, walked with a limp, and not just because of advancing age. She was born to a relatively well-off landowner and his wife, and as a child her feet were bound with cloth for six years, in the painful traditional Chinese practice intended to create artificially dainty feet.
身材矮小、笑声爽朗的高耀洁走路一瘸一拐，但这并不仅是因为年事已高。她出生在一个相对富裕的地主家庭，小时候双脚用布条裹了六年，这是一种令人痛苦的中国传统习俗，目的是人为制造出小巧的双脚。

It was never just about the neon, that Cubist, consumerist razzle-dazzle cantilevered over Hong Kong’s streets announcing pawnbrokers and mooncake bakers, saunas and shark’s fin soup shops.It was never just about the signs, shining on teahouses offering the finest Iron Goddess of Mercy brew and on hotels paid for by the hour, or on Chinese medicine emporiums bursting with wooden drawers of seahorses and on mahjong parlors clickety-clacking with manicured nails hitting hard tiles.Those whims lack any whimsy.
高悬在香港街头令人眼花缭乱的霓虹灯招牌从来都不只是关于霓虹灯的，这些有点像立体派艺术、充满消费主义气息的广告牌告诉路人，他们正在从当铺、糕点店、桑拿房和鱼翅大排档前走过。霓虹灯招牌也从来不只是关于招牌的，它让路人注意到号称有最好铁观音的茶馆、按小时收费的酒店，或木质药柜里装满了海马等名贵药材的中药店，以及不断传出咔哒声的麻将馆，那是修剪漂亮的指甲翻牌时发出的声音。这些风波并非突发奇想。

Separately, some businesses voluntarily replaced neon with cheaper LED displays.Ms. Chan talks to those served takedown notices, documenting the visual history of their trade. Pawnshops advertised with outlines of bats clutching coins because the word for the winged mammal sounds like “fortune.” Symbols — teeth, glasses, tea leaves — were once important for customers who could not read.
另外，一些商家已自愿将霓虹灯招牌换成了更经济的LED显示屏。陈倩雯与那些收到拆除通知的人联系，将他们店面的视觉历史记录下来。当铺做广告的霓虹灯用“蝠鼠吊金钱”的形状，因为这种会飞的哺乳类动物的名称与“福”谐音。对不识字的顾客来说，用牙齿、眼镜、茶叶等形状的符号做广告曾非常重要。

Some of Hong Kong’s defenders, who praise the city’s current incarnation, or at least its talent for reinvention, say that the neon cityscape never truly defined the territory. It was a kitschy tourist pitch, they say, from a movie set of kung fu kicks or cheongsam-clad women walking rainy streets with only the dirge of a cello to accompany them. Most Hong Kong residents lived far from the lurid glow reflected in puddles, crammed into Tetris blocks of tiled buildings that sprawled toward the border with China.
一些捍卫香港的人赞扬城市现在的样子，或至少赞扬它在重塑自身形象方面的天赋，他们说，霓虹灯景观从来都不是对香港城市轮廓的真正界定。他们还说，霓虹灯招牌是一种俗气的旅游宣传，来自功夫片的布景或电影中穿旗袍的女子在大提琴的凄惨乐声伴奏下走在下雨的街头。大多数香港居民住的地方距离路面积水中的俗艳倒影很远，他们居住在拥挤得像鸽子笼、外墙贴着瓷砖、朝着中国边界方向蔓延的建筑物里。

The art of neon — bending glass tubes that are filled with neon and other inert gases — came to Hong Kong, in part, from Shanghai. y the 1970s, the streets of Wan Chai and Tsim Sha Tsui, Central and Yau Ma Tei, thrummed with neon-tinged commerce, the electric signboards hung in profusion like L.S.D.-fueled Picassos.
霓虹灯的制作包括将玻璃管弯曲成设计的形状，然后在里面充上氖气和其他惰性气体，其制作手艺部分是从上海传到香港的。到20世纪70年代，湾仔、尖沙咀、中环和油麻地的街头到处都能感受到霓虹灯下的商业气息，到处都能看到色彩斑斓的招牌，像是迷幻药刺激下创作的毕加索作品。

It seemed fitting that in the 1980s the world’s biggest neon sign, for Marlboro cigarettes, was in Hong Kong. Some of the neon was in English, some in Arabic, some in Japanese. Most were in the traditional Chinese characters used in Hong Kong but not in mainland China. To fashion glass tubes into such complicated calligraphy — it takes 16 strokes to write the word “dragon” — took a painterly skill.
在20世纪80年代，香港曾有世界上最大的万宝路香烟霓虹灯广告，似乎与这种气息相一致。这里的霓虹灯招牌有英文的、阿拉伯文的，也有日文的。但大多数用的是香港仍在使用、中国内地已不再使用的繁体字。“龙”的繁体字有16个笔画，用玻璃管制出如此复杂的字需要有很高的绘画技巧。

Mr. Yudkowsky, who has since become one of the A.I. world’s best-known doomers, told me that he didn’t originate the term p(doom), although he helped to popularize it. (He also said that his p(doom), if current A.I. trends continue, is “yes.”) The term was later adopted by members of the Effective Altruism movement, who use logical reasoning to arrive at ideas about moral goodness.For some, talking about your p(doom) is just idle chitchat. 
后来成了AI世界最著名末日论者的尤科夫斯基告诉我，p(末日)这个词不是他提出的，不过他做了推广普及。（他还说，如果继续以现在的趋势发展，他的p(末日)是“有多高就多高”。）这个词后来被有效利他主义者们拿去用了，这个群体旨在通过逻辑推论得出有关公序良俗的理念.对一些人来说，谈论你的p(末日)无非就是在闲扯。

Mr. Levie, the chief executive of Box, belongs to the more optimistic camp. He says his p(doom) is very low — not zero, but “about as low as it could be” — and he’s betting that we’ll mitigate the big risks from A.I. and avoid the worst possible outcomes. His worry is not that A.I. will kill us all, but that regulators and lawmakers will seize on scary predictions of doom as a rationale for cracking down on a promising young sector.
Box首席执行官勒维属于较乐观的一方。他说他的p(末日)值很低——不是零，但“能多低就多低”——他认为我们能化解AI的巨大风险，避免最糟糕的结果。他担心的不是AI会杀死我们，而是监管者和立法者会利用这些可怕的末日预言，用来理直气壮地打压一个前景远大的年轻行业。

Why not plow ahead? That’s the question that loomed over A.I.’s adolescence — the year or so after the technology made the leap from lab to living room. There was hand-wringing over chatbots writing seductive phishing emails and spewing disinformation, or high schoolers using them to cheat their way to an A. Doomsayers insisted that unfettered A.I. could lead to the end of humankind.
为什么不勇往直前呢？这是在人工智能的青春期——这种技术完成从实验室到客厅的飞跃，也就是大概一年之前的事——一直笼罩着的问题。人们对聊天机器人编写出诱人的网络钓鱼电邮和散布虚假信息，或者高中生利用它们作弊得到高分而感到不安。末日预言者坚称，不受约束的人工智能可能导致人类的终结。

Over 12 months, Silicon Valley was transformed. Turning artificial intelligence into actual products that individuals and companies could use became the priority. Worries about safety and whether machines would turn on their creators were not ignored, but they were shunted aside — at least for the moment.
在12个月的时间里，硅谷发生了翻天覆地的变化。将人工智能转化为个人和企业可以使用的实际产品成为当务之急。对安全以及机器是否会攻击其创造者的担忧并未被忽视，但它们被搁置了——至少目前如此。

Few nations now feature more centrally in the great-power competition between the United States and China, placing Vietnam, which has a long history of fierce independence, in a high-risk, high-reward position. Keeping both giants happy could mean a transformative economic boost; angering one or the other could bring heavy costs.This is a very delicate dance for Vietnam’s government,They have to dance on a very thin tightrope, and the tightrope has become even thinner.
在中美的大国竞争中，很少有国家能像越南一样扮演如此关键的角色，使这个曾为独立而进行顽强漫长抗争的国家面临着高风险、高回报的处境。让中美两个大国都满意可能会为其经济带来变革性增长，激怒其中一方则可能导致沉重的代价。对越南政府来说，这是一场非常微妙的周旋，他们要走一根非常纤细的钢索，而这条钢索还在变得越来越细。

He introduced that phrase about a decade ago as part of a plan to line up regional support and tamp down distrust among Southeast Asian nations that were once China’s tributary states. Several countries, including Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, have signed on, but Vietnam has resisted, fearing that it could be interpreted as acceptance of Chinese hegemony.Vietnam has not escaped China’s orbit just yet,Beijing has not ‘lost’ a country in its periphery to the ‘Western camp.’
在大约十年前提出这一概念，旨在争取区域性支持，并消弭历史上曾向中国朝贡的东南亚国家之间的不信任。柬埔寨、老挝和缅甸等国家都已加入，但越南始终不愿意，担心此举可能被视为对中国霸权的接纳。越南尚未脱离中国的轨道，北京没有‘失去’这个邻国，让其落入‘西方阵营’之手”

The Chinese Coast Guard defended its actions against the Philippine ships as “professional, standardized, legitimate, and legal.” In statements released over the weekend and on Monday, China warned the Philippines to “strictly control frontline provocations and not shoot itself in the foot.” The Coast Guard said the Philippine boat on Sunday had “swerved suddenly in an unprofessional and dangerous manner, and deliberately collided” with the Chinese Coast Guard ship.
中国海警为针对菲律宾船只的行动辩护，称其行动“合理合法、专业规范”。中国在周末和周一发声明警告菲律宾，“严格管束一线挑衅举动，不要搬起石头砸自己的脚。”中国海岸警卫队说，菲律宾船只周日“与我海警执法艇发生刮蹭是菲方蓄意‘碰瓷’造成的。”

Around the world, authoritarianism is ascendant and democracy is in decline.The United States wasn’t impervious to this trend. The report found that America was “moderately backsliding” on its democracy.But I fear that we’re now on the precipice of fully turning away from democracy and toward a full embrace of authoritarianism. The country seems thirsty for it; many Americans appear to be inviting it.
在世界范围内，专制在抬头，民主在衰落。美国也不能逃脱这股潮流。报告发现美国的民主存在“一定程度的倒退”。然而我担心，我们正站在完全背离民主、堕入专制的悬崖边上。这个国家似乎在渴望着专制，许多美国人在做的事将招致这样的结果。

You could also argue that President Biden, whose approval numbers are languishing, is being punished by some because he isn’t an authoritarian and therefore isn’t able to govern by fiat: Many of his initiatives — voter protections, police reform, student loan forgiveness — were blocked by conservatives. Trump surely appeals to those who want a president who’ll simply bulldoze through that bureaucracy, or at least expresses contempt for it and is willing to threaten it.
拜登总统惨不忍睹的民调满意度可以看作是一些认为他不专制的人在惩罚他，不专制导致他不能进行严明的治理：他发起的许多行动——选民保护、警察改革、学生债务免除——被保守派封阻了。有的人希望一个总统能把这些繁文缛节一举推翻，或至少表达他的蔑视，有形成威胁的意愿，特朗普无疑就是在迎合这类人。

The House voted on Wednesday to formally open an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, pushing forward with a yearlong G.O.P. investigation that has failed to produce evidence of anything approaching high crimes or misdemeanors.Democrats have denounced the inquiry as a fishing expedition and a political stunt.Republicans have labored, so far without success, to prove that President Biden was enriched by his son’s business dealings.
众议院周三投票决定正式启动对拜登总统的弹劾调查，从而推进了共和党长达一年的调查，但该调查未能拿出任何接近重罪或轻罪的证据。民主党人谴责这项调查是捕风捉影和政治噱头。共和党人花了大力气想要证明拜登总统靠亨特的商业交易中饱私囊，但到目前为止还没有成功。

They ridiculed my struggle with addiction; they belittled my recovery; and they have tried to dehumanize me — all to embarrass and damage my father, who has devoted his entire public life to service
他们嘲笑我与毒瘾的斗争；他们贬低我的康复；他们还试图将我非人化——一切都是为了给我父亲造成难堪和伤害，而我父亲是个把全部政治生涯都奉献给了公共事业的人

The report is a tangible sign of how much the bipartisan consensus toward China has shifted in recent years.The most prevalent argument a decade ago was that economic interdependence between the United States and China would be a force for peace and stability. The report said that the United States had never before faced a geopolitical adversary with which it was so economically interconnected, and that the full extent of the risk of relying on a strategic competitor remained unknown. The country lacks a contingency plan in the case of further conflict, it said.
这份报告切实表明，近年来两党对中国的共识发生了很大变化。十年前最流行的观点是，美中之间的经济相互依存将是和平与稳定的力量。报告称，美国从未遇到过与之在经济上如此紧密相连的地缘政治对手，依赖一个战略竞争对手的风险究竟有多大，目前仍然不得而知。报告称，美国缺乏应对进一步冲突的应急计划。

Volkswagen used to import shock absorbers from Central Europe for cars it makes at Chinese factories. Now it buys them from a company in China for 40 percent less.Volkswagen is looking to shrink its costly, heavily unionized work force in Europe, as well as trim its reliance on high-cost European auto parts manufacturers.The cuts in Europe and imports from China could produce a double whammy for Germany, where the car industry has been a mainstay of the economy and accounts for nearly 800,000 jobs. 
大众以前在中国工厂生产汽车采用的是从中欧进口的减震器。现在的减震器采购自一家中国公司，成本比以前低了40%。大众汽车正计划收缩其成本高昂且高度工会化的欧洲员工规模，同时减少对高成本的欧洲汽车零部件制造商的依赖。在欧洲的裁员加上从中国进口汽车可能会给德国带来双重打击，汽车工业一直是德国经济的支柱，创造了近80万个就业岗位。

On the ship’s bridge, tasks that previously occupied seven or eight crew members have been consolidated into using three or four. The ship’s nurse doubles as dishwasher and cook. Extra sprinklers were installed to compensate for the smaller staff onboard to fight fires at sea.Even as Japan struggles to recruit conventional troops, it must also attract new battalions of technologically savvy soldiers to operate sophisticated equipment or protect against cyberattacks. 
在舰桥上，以前需要七八名船员完成的任务，现在合并到三四名船员身上。船上的护士兼做洗碗工和厨师。船上安装了额外的喷水灭火装置，以弥补海上灭火人员的不足。在努力招募常规部队的同时，日本还必须吸引新一批精通技术的士兵来操作复杂的设备，或抵御网络攻击。

A recent drill on a base in Naha revealed the labor demands of even mundane tasks: 90 troops assembled on a 50-yard-long concrete slab to practice repairing a runway after a hypothetical enemy attack. Over nearly three hours, they bulldozed piles of rubble and tamped down dirt with teeth-rattling soil compaction rammers.The troops completed their duties with artisanal care, smoothing newly laid concrete with hand trowels and sweeping away cement dust with small brushes.
最近在那霸市一个基地进行的一次演习显示，即使稀松平常的任务也需要辛苦的劳作：90名士兵聚集在一个约45米长的混凝土板上，练习在假想的敌人袭击后修复跑道。在近三个小时的时间里，他们用推土机推平了成堆的瓦砾，用发出巨响的夯土机把泥土夯实。士兵们以工匠般的细心完成了任务，用手铲平整新铺设的混凝土，用小刷子清扫水泥灰尘。

Queried about problems, Mr. Putin largely brushed them off, even when it came to the skyrocketing price of eggs. He responded to a question about it with a deadpan, off-color joke before apologizing for his government’s inability to come to grips with the problem. Putin isn’t interested in currying favor or buttering people up. He believes that the people are with him, and therefore he allows himself to behave very reservedly.
关于困难的提问，普京基本都轻描淡写，甚至连鸡蛋价格飙升问题都不例外——他对此一本正经地开了个下流玩笑，然后才为政府未能解决这个问题表示道歉。普京对讨好奉承民众那一套不感兴趣。他相信人民站在自己的这一边，因此他的言行举止非常冷淡。

If he wins as expected in March and serves the term to completion, he would become the longest-serving Russian leader since Empress Catherine the Great in the 18th century.In the ticker of questions was this one: “Why is your reality so divergent from our existence?”Another questioner, using Mr. Putin’s patronymic as a sign of respect, wrote: “Vladimir Vladimirovich, please tell us, when are we going to live better?”
如果他在明年3月如期赢下大选并完成任期，他将成为自18世纪叶卡捷琳娜大帝以来在位时间最长的俄罗斯领导人。其中有这样一条提问：“为什么你的现实与我们体验到的如此不同？”另一位提问者用普京父名的尊称写道：“弗拉基米尔·弗拉基米罗维奇，请告诉我们，我们的生活什么时候才能变好？”

In a faintly stilted tone and with slightly awkward grammar, the American-accented voice on YouTube last month ridiculed Washington’s handling of the war between Israel and Hamas, claiming that the United States was unable to “play its role as a mediator like China” and “now finds itself in a position of significant isolation.”Some of the videos used artificially generated avatars or voice-overs, making the campaign the first influence operation known to the institute to pair A.I. voices with video essays.Some of the clips fawned over Chinese companies like Huawei and denigrated American companies like Apple.
上个月在YouTube上的一段视频里，一个略显生硬、语法稍微有些奇怪、带美国口音的声音用英语嘲笑美国政府处理以色列与哈马斯战争的方式，声称美国未能“像中国那样起调解人的作用”，“现已发现自己处于明显的孤立状态”。这些视频中有些使用了人工生成的用户头像或解说，使其成为该研究所已知的首个用人工智能生成的声音为视频文章配音的影响力运动。有些视频充满了恭维华为等中国公司、诋毁苹果等美国公司的宣传。

he supported a more rigorous vetting of foreign researchers. But Mr. Woodard said that he did not want a blanket ban on students and scholars from China.the Florida law was another example of the “fear-mongering and scapegoating of Chinese American immigrants and students in the country.”Mr. Li’s research in the United States has since contributed to the development of targeted cancer treatments that could produce fewer side effects than those of earlier approaches.
他支持对外国研究人员进行更严格的审查。但伍达德表示，他不希望全面禁止来自中国的学生和学者。佛罗里达州的这项法律是“在美国的华裔移民和学生当中散布恐惧和寻找替罪羊”的又一个例子。自那以后，李成龙在美国的研究为靶向癌症治疗的发展做出了贡献，这种治疗方法产生的副作用比以前的方法要少。

During downtime between classes on how to waterproof a rucksack or set up an ambush, last month’s jungle students worked on ropes and pulleys for a test they have to pass to graduate. Map and compass navigation has also become mandatory.The analog instruction remains necessary even with the Pentagon’s relentless push for new technology. Army commanders note that artificial intelligence and drones cannot hold territory or manage resupply in soggy gulches where electricity and clean water are scarce.
丛林学校上个月的学员们上了如何对背包进行防水处理的课后，还要上如何设埋伏的课，他们在这两堂课之间的休息时间努力练习一个使用绳索和滑轮的测试，那是他们毕业必须通过的测试。用地图和指南针来确定位置和方向也已成为必修课。在五角大楼不停地推动新技术的时候，仍有必要让学员学会不依赖电子设备的方法。陆军指挥官们指出，在潮湿的急流峡谷里，由于缺少电力和清洁水，人工智能和无人机无法坚守阵地或管理补给。

In interviews with state media outlets, residents recounted being jolted awake and fleeing into the cold with barely enough time to grab extra layers of clothing. Photos showed people in a plaza wrapped in thick comforters.On social media, people who said they were at the quake site reported that they had started bonfires in their yards or set fire to cardboard boxes to keep warm. The local government did not have enough clothes, quilts or shoes and would need to rely on the provincial government
在接受官媒采访时，居民讲述了他们如何被地震震醒，随后逃到寒冷的户外，几乎没有时间多拿几件衣服。图片显示一处广场上许多人裹着厚被子。自称是地震亲历者的人在社交媒体上透露，他们在院里生起篝火，或是通过烧纸箱来取暖。当地政府没有足够的棉服、棉被和棉鞋，需要依靠省政府调拨。

LG, a $10 billion corporate empire, is governed by the principle of male primogeniture. Succession was effectively settled 14 years earlier when Koo and his wife adopted their eldest nephew, Koo Kwang-mo. and their efforts for another male heir resulted in a second daughter.
LG是一个价值100亿美元的企业帝国，遵循长子继承的原则。14年前，具本茂夫妇收养了他们的长侄具光谟，继承问题就得到了有效解决。后来他们也想再生一个男性继承人，结果有了第二个女儿。

In a legal filing, the former chairperson’s widow, Kim Young-shik, and her daughters, Koo Yeon-kyung and Koo Yeon-sue, accused LG executives of colluding with Koo Kwang-mo and his biological father to swindle them.Without a will, South Korean law states, the widow would be entitled to inherit one-third of the estate with the remainder divided equally between the two daughters and Kwang-mo.We cannot stand having our rights, protected under the constitution and the law, be disregarded just because we are women
在一份法律文件中，前会长具本茂的遗孀金英植和女儿具延京（音）及具延苏（音）指控LG高管与具光谟及其生父勾结，诈骗她们。韩国法律规定，如果没有遗嘱，寡妇有权继承三分之一的遗产，其余的遗产由两个女儿和具光谟平均分配。我们不能忍受仅仅因为我们是女性，就无视我们受宪法和法律保护的权利

For decades, South Korea’s economy has been dominated by a handful of family-run conglomerates that hold outsize wealth and influence and factor into nearly every aspect of life in the country.Because of their political heft, the chaebol, as these families are known, have long been a matter of immense public interest. The marriages, deaths, estrangements and legal troubles of these families are chronicled in the South Korean press. Fictional chaebol families have been depicted in Korean dramas. 
几十年来，韩国经济一直由少数几家家族经营的企业集团主导，它们拥有巨大的财富和影响力，几乎影响着这个国家生活的方方面面。因其政治影响力，这些家族被称为“财阀”，长期以来一直是公众关注的焦点。韩国媒体记录了这些家庭的婚姻、死亡、隔阂与法律纠纷。韩剧中经常出现虚构的财阀家族。

Russians buy almost exclusively internal combustion cars. China has a surplus of them because its consumers have shifted swiftly to electric cars.But lower-middle-class and poor Russian families, whose members make up the bulk of the soldiers fighting the war, have stepped up purchases of affordable Chinese cars.Never before have we seen automakers from a single country gobble up so much market share so quickly — the Chinese came into a windfall
俄罗斯人几乎只买内燃汽车。中国这类汽车存在过剩的情况，因为它的消费者迅速转向电动车。俄罗斯中下层阶级和贫困家庭（其成员构成参战士兵的主体）已经更多开始购买价格合理的中国汽车。我们从未见过一个国家的汽车制造商如此迅速地抢占了如此多的市场份额——中国车企发了横财。

We do not reach these conclusions lightly. We are mindful of the magnitude and weight of the questions now before us. We are likewise mindful of our solemn duty to apply the law, without fear or favor, and without being swayed by public reaction to the decisions that the law mandates we reach.
这并不是一个草率做出的决定。我们深知眼前这些问题的重要性和影响力。但我们也深知自身的神圣职责正是无所畏惧、不偏不倚地执行法律，在依法做出裁决时不受公众反应的左右。

They added that “a reading that renders the document a ‘secret code’ loaded with hidden meanings discernible only by a select priesthood of illuminati is generally an unlikely one.”
他们还说，“将条文解读成一项‘秘密法规’，充斥着只有光明会特命祭司才看得出的隐义，往往就是一种不成立的解读。”

The eruption began late Monday, with fountains of lava pouring from a fissure within a volcanic system on the Reykjanes Peninsula, the most populated region in Iceland and home to its capital, Reykjavik. Helicopter video shared by Iceland’s Civil Defense showed steam rising from a glowing, snaking river of lava.
火山爆发于周一晚间开始，熔岩从雷恰角半岛火山群的裂缝中喷涌而出。该半岛是冰岛人口最多的地区，也是冰岛首都雷克雅未克的所在地。冰岛民防部门分享的直升机视频显示，蒸汽从一条闪烁蜿蜒的熔岩河中升起。

The fact that the activity is decreasing already is not an indication of how long the eruption will last, but rather that the eruption is reaching a state of equilibrium.Iceland straddles two tectonic plates, which are themselves divided by an undersea mountain chain that oozes molten hot rock.Iceland has one of the world’s most effective volcanic preparedness measures
事实上，火山活动已经在减少，这并不能说明火山爆发将持续多久，而是表明火山爆发正在达到一种平衡状态。冰岛横跨两个构造板块，这两个板块本身被渗出熔融热岩的海底山脉隔开。冰岛是世界上拥有最有效的火山防范措施的国家之一。

“If all you chase is efficiency — if you think the person is better off on the unemployment line with a third 40-inch television than he is working with only two — then you’re not going to agree with me,” Mr. Lighthizer said. “There’s a group of people who think that consumption is the end. And my view is production is the end, and safe and happy communities are the end. You should be willing to pay a price for that.”
“如果你追求的只是效率——如果你认为，一个人没有工作但家里有三台40英寸电视好过有工作但家里只有两台电视——那你就不会同意我的观点，”莱特希泽说。“有些人认为消费是目的。我的观点是，生产才是目的，安全和幸福的社区才是目的。人们应该愿意为这个目的付出代价。”

Politically, Mr. Trump was ahead of the pack in focusing on the downsides of free trade. For more than 30 years, he has railed against trade deficits, which he views like company balance sheets as a simple matter of profits and losses. He complains that foreign countries that export more to the United States than they import from it are ripping America off.
从政治上来看，特朗普是率先关注自由贸易弊端的人。他30多年来一直在抨击贸易逆差，认为贸易逆差就像公司资产负债表那样，是个损益的简单问题。他抱怨说，那些向美国出口商品多于从美国进口商品的国家是在敲美国竹杠。

Jerry Yu has the trappings of what the Chinese call second-generation rich. He boasts a Connecticut prep-school education. He lives in a Manhattan condominium bought for $8 million from Jeffrey R. Immelt, the former General Electric chief executive.None of this would be known had Mr. Yu’s company — BitRush Inc., also known as BytesRush — not run into troubles in the tiny Texas Panhandle town of Channing, population 281, where contractors say they weren’t fully paid for their work on his mine there.He said the claims made by Crypton, including that it was not paid for services at the mine, were “baseless and without merit.”
杰里·俞（音）这种人在中国被称为“富二代”。他拥有一间康涅狄格州预科学校的学历，住在以800万美元从前通用电气首席执行官杰弗里·伊梅尔特手中买下的曼哈顿共管公寓里。要不是杰里·俞的公司BitRush Inc.（又名BytesRush）在得克萨斯州潘汉德尔只有281人的小镇钱宁遇到麻烦，这一切都不会为人所知。该公司的承包商称其拖欠工程款。他说，Crypton公司的说法，包括该公司在矿场的服务没有得到报酬，都是“毫无根据、毫无道理的”。

In Channing, the arrival of BitRush last year garnered a lot of attention, and some residents landed jobs constructing the mine, which was built next to an electrical substation.One of them, Brent Loudder, is a judge, the town’s volunteer fire chief and the husband of the county’s deputy sheriff. Mr. Loudder, who oversaw the electrical and plumbing work for Crypton, said the contractors did not get paid until they protested by holding work stoppages.
BitRush在去年来到钱宁，吸引了很多关注，一些居民找到了建造矿场的工作，这个矿场建在一个变电站旁边。其中一位名叫布伦特·劳德，他是一名法官，也是该镇的志愿消防队长，县副警长的丈夫。劳德负责监督Crypton的电气和管道工程，他说，承包商们通过停工抗议才拿到工资。

Paying with Tether is widespread in the Bitcoin-mining industry. One of the benefits of those transactions can be avoiding sales and capital gains taxes.
用Tether支付在比特币挖矿行业很普遍。这些交易的好处之一是可以避免营业税和资本利得税。

Analysts from Nomura, a Japanese bank, said in a report on Tuesday that the rules could “significantly impair” Chinese video game companies’ ability to make money.The “fire-quenching measures” the government has rolled out since Friday, Nomura added, will ease investor concerns but won’t remove the shadow it has thrown over China’s video game sector.For their part, Tencent and Netease have downplayed the impact of the proposed regulations.
日本野村银行的分析师在周二的一份报告中说，这些管理办法可能“在相当程度上削弱”中国视频游戏公司的赚钱能力。野村证券还表示，政府自周五以来推出的“灭火措施”将缓解投资者的担忧，但不会消除其给中国电子游戏行业带来的阴影。就公司而言，腾讯和网易已淡化了拟议中的管理办法的影响。

We should have a spirit of tolerance, which is to say to what extent can we compromise with reality? Don’t feel bad about compromising. Time will slowly change everything. Earlier in his career, Mr. Yuan often mixed with American scholars, some of whom saw him as a coolheaded observer of Washington.
应该具有容忍的精神，所谓容忍，就是在多大范围内，能够和现实妥协。不要因为妥协而难过，时间会逐渐改变一切。在其职业生涯早期，袁亦鲲经常与美国学者打交道，这些学者中有部分人认为，他对美国的观察是十分理性的。

The trust, the investment arm of the state-owned financial conglomerate Citic, called housing “China’s economic ballast” and “an indispensable value investment.” The money it raised would be put toward four projects from Sunac China Holdings, a major developer.Three years later, investors who put their money in the Citic fund have recouped only a small fraction of their investment. Three of the fund’s construction projects are on hold or significantly delayed because of financing problems or poor sales. Sunac has defaulted and is trying to restructure its debt.
中信信托是国有金融集团中信的投资部门，将房地产称为“中国经济压舱石”和“资产配置中不可缺少的价值投资”。该信托将筹集的资金投入到了大型开发商融创中国控股有限公司的四个项目中。三年后，把钱投进中信基金的投资人仅收回了一小部分资金。该基金投资的三处项目都因资金问题或销售不佳被迫停工或严重延期。已经出现违约的融创正在试图重组债务。
