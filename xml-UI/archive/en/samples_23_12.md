This week, though, the two parties — which both argue that they are better able to ensure peace with China — chose in spectacular fashion to go to war against each other. An incipient deal for a joint presidential ticket between the long-established Nationalist Party and the upstart Taiwan People’s Party unraveled with the speed, melodrama and lingering vitriol of a celebrity wedding gone wrong.Mr. Gou, who had also thrown his hat in the ring, withdrew from the race.
然而，这两个在野党上周却以令人惊叹的方式选择了相互开战，它们都信誓旦旦，自称更有能力确保与中国的和平。历史更为悠久的国民党与新兴的台湾民众党联合起来参加总统大选的初步协议，以名人婚礼出了状况的那种速度、戏剧性和迟迟不去的尖刻无情崩溃了。曾宣布参选的郭台铭也退出了大选。

For now, many Taiwanese people seem absorbed — sometimes gleeful, sometimes anguished — by the spectacle of recent days. “Wave Makers,” a recent Netflix drama series, showed Taiwanese electoral politics as a noble, if sometimes cutthroat, affair. This week was more like the political satire “Veep.”
就目前而言，许多台湾人似乎被最近几天的情况所吸引，时而高兴，时而痛苦。虽然网飞不久前有一部台剧《造浪者》将台湾的选举政治表现得崇高，尽管有时也很残酷，但上周的情况更像是政治讽刺美剧《副总统》

“Émigré,” a new oratorio about Jewish refugees who fled Nazi Germany for Shanghai in the late 1930s, begins with a song by two brothers, Josef and Otto, as their steamship approaches a Chinese harbor.“Shanghai, beacon of light on a silent shore,” they sing. “Shanghai, answer these desperate cries.”
新的清唱剧《上海！上海！》（英文名Émigré）讲述的是20世纪30年代末逃离纳粹德国的犹太难民前来上海避难的故事。故事以约瑟夫和奥托两兄弟的一首歌开始，他们乘坐的轮船正在靠近中国港口。“上海，无声海岸上的灯塔，”他们唱道。“上海，这些绝望叫声的回答。”

They have bought gold bars small enough to be scattered unobtrusively through carry-on luggage, as well as large stacks of foreign currency.Money sluicing out of China has weakened the currency, the renminbi, against the dollar and other currencies. And that weakness of the renminbi has helped sustain China’s exports, which support tens of millions of Chinese jobs.
他们购买了小到可以不起眼地分散在随身行李中的金条，以及大量外币。流出中国的资金削弱了人民币对美元和其他货币的汇率。人民币的疲软有助于维持中国的出口，而出口支撑着中国数千万的就业岗位。

The American efforts to scrutinize and restrict the activities of G42 are emblematic of the murky world in which U.S. spy agencies operate in their broader espionage shadow war with China. As the superpower rivalry intensifies, U.S. policymakers are relying on intelligence collection and analysis to help head off China’s efforts to make technological advances that would erode America’s military edge.
美国审查和限制G42活动的努力象征着美国间谍机构与中国展开更广泛间谍暗战的阴暗世界。随着超级大国之间的竞争加剧，美国政策制定者正依靠情报收集和分析来帮助阻止中国取得削弱美国军事优势的技术进步。

And the U.S. efforts to put G42 under a microscope show how difficult it is for intelligence agencies to discern whether a foreign company with commercial ties to China has links to that country’s military or its security and intelligence agencies.
美国将G42置于显微镜下的努力表明，情报机构很难辨别一家与中国有商业关系的外国公司是否与中国军方或安全和情报机构有联系。

The trickle became a steady stream: For nearly the past two decades, Chinese students have made up the largest share of international students in the United States.Students have been an anchor in the two countries’ relations, even when political or economic ties have soured.We’re going to play catch-up, to our detriment, unless we act really quickly
涓涓细流变成了源源不断的人流：在过去的近20年里，中国留学生一直在美国的国际学生中占比最大。即使中美之间的政治或经济关系已经恶化，留学生一直在两国关系中起一种稳定作用。除非我们真正迅速行动起来，我们将不得不努力追赶，这对我们不利

In filing confidentially for an initial public offering, Shein, the ultrafast-fashion retailer, is showing ambition on two fronts.The company and its underwriters are betting that investors will be more receptive to I.P.O.s, even though high-profile market debuts this fall largely fizzled out. Shein is also testing whether it can endure what’s likely to be an increase in political heat on the China-founded e-commerce giant.
超快时尚零售商希音以保密方式提交首次公开募股(IPO)申请，显示出了两方面的雄心。该公司及其承销商认为，投资者将对IPO持更为接受的态度，尽管今年秋天高调上市的公司基本上都以失败告终。此外，作为一家在中国成立的电子商务巨头，希音还在测试自己能否承受可能面临的政治压力。

Bankers had hoped that the long-moribund market for new listings would reopen this fall with offerings from the chip designer Arm, the grocery delivery service Instacart and the sandal maker Birkenstock. Instead, those debuts quickly busted.
银行家们曾希望，随着芯片设计公司Arm、杂货配送服务公司Instacart和凉鞋制造商Birkenstock的上市，沉寂已久的新股上市市场会在今年秋天重启。然而，这些IPO很快就失败了。

First the trucks arrived, carrying armed men toward the mist-shrouded mountaintop. Then the flames appeared, sweeping across a forest of towering pines and oaks.After the fire laid waste to the forest last year, the trucks returned. This time, they carried the avocado plants taking root in the orchards scattered across the once tree-covered summit where townspeople used to forage for mushrooms.
最先来的是卡车，载着武装人员向薄雾笼罩的山顶进发。山火接踵而至，吞噬了大片高耸的松树和橡树林。在去年的大火将森林烧毁之后，卡车又回来了。这一次，它们运来的牛油果树在果园里生根，这样的果园散布在曾经满是苍翠的山顶各处，镇上的人过去常常到这里采蘑菇。

In western Mexico, forests are being razed at a breakneck pace and while deforestation in places such as the Amazon rainforest or Borneo is driven by cattle ranching, gold mining and palm oil farms, in this hot spot, it is fueled by the voracious appetite in the United States for avocados.
在墨西哥西部，森林正在被飞速夷为平地。虽然亚马孙雨林或婆罗洲等地的森林采伐是由牛场、金矿和棕榈油农场驱动的，但此地大肆毁林的问题却是由美国对牛油果的海量需求造成的。

Charles Munger, who quit a well-established law career to be Warren Buffett’s partner and maxim-spouting alter-ego as they transformed a foundering New England textile company into the spectacularly successful investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, died Tuesday in Santa Barbara, California. He was 99.
查理·芒格于周二在加州圣巴巴拉去世，享年99岁。他放弃了已功成名就的律师事业，成为沃伦·巴菲特的合伙人和金句频出的挚友，两人联手将一家江河日下的新英格兰纺织公司转型为无比成功的投资公司伯克希尔·哈撒韦。

What you have to learn is to fold early when the odds are against you,or if you have a big edge, back it heavily, because you don’t get a big edge often, so seize it when it does come.
你必须学会的是在形势不利的情况下及早认输，而如果有大牌在手，就要下重注，因为你不常拿到大牌。机会出现，但不是经常的事，所以一旦它降临就要紧紧抓住。

Few diplomats have been both celebrated and reviled with such passion as Mr. Kissinger. Considered the most powerful secretary of state in the post-World War II era, he was by turns hailed as an ultrarealist who reshaped diplomacy to reflect American interests and denounced as having abandoned American values, particularly in the arena of human rights, if he thought it served the nation’s purposes.
很少有外交官能像基辛格那样毁誉都如此强烈。他被认为是“二战”后权力最大的美国国务卿，时而被赞颂为一个为美国利益重塑外交政策的终极务实者，时而又被谴责在自认为有利于国家时会抛弃美国价值观，特别是在人权问题方面。

The Biden administration has been trying to jump-start the domestic supply chain for electric vehicles so cleaner cars can be made in the United States. If we were to start the project up today, we would be hemorrhaging cash.The administration faces a tricky calculation with the new rules.
拜登政府一直在努力启动美国国内的电动汽车供应链，在美国生产更清洁的汽车。如果我们今天投产，将会损失大量资金,拜登政府在进一步明确新规则时，面临棘手的考量。

If it allows more companies to qualify for the benefits, Americans will have a wider choice of low-cost electric vehicles to choose from. That would put more clean cars on the road and help to mitigate climate change. It could also help to shore up the finances of U.S. automakers that are losing heavily on electric vehicle production.
如果政府允许更多公司生产的电动汽车享受税收抵免资格，美国人将有更多便宜的电动汽车可供选择。这将让更多人用上清洁汽车，有助于缓解气候变化。它还可能有助于提振在电动汽车生产方面亏损严重的美国汽车制造商的财务状况。

China dominates production of materials, like graphite and processed lithium, that are essential to the flow of electricity within a battery, and to the cathodes and anodes, the basic building blocks of a battery. 
中国主导着石墨和加工锂等材料的生产，这些材料对电池中的电流流动、以及电池的主要部件阴极和阳极至关重要。

Knowing him as they did, the Chinese played to his sense of self regard during his visit in July. They feted and flattered him. They put him up in the same guest quarters he had occupied during his historic visits in the 1970s. They hosted meetings in the same building where he had met their predecessors.Mr. Kissinger returned home and dutifully filled in Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken by phone; met with William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director; and passed along his impressions to Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser.
出于对他的了解，中国在他7月的访问期间迎合了他的自尊。他们款待他、奉承他，把他安排在上世纪70年代进行历史性访问时住过的客房里。他们在他会见前任中国领导人的同一幢楼里进行会面。基辛格回国后，尽职尽责地给国务卿布林肯打了电话，会见了中情局局长伯恩斯，并把他的印象转达给了国家安全顾问沙利文。

Kissinger’s life mission was to help create and maintain order in an international system that was always threatening to spin out of control.He traveled the globe at an age when most of his contemporaries had either died or retreated to a retirement home. There were few if any doors in capitals around the world that did not open to him.It’s nothing short of remarkable.Mr. Kissinger’s enduring presence in the halls of power, even with a visitor’s pass, stood out.
基辛格一生的使命是在一个随时可能失控的国际体系中帮助建立和维持秩序，他的同龄人不是已经去世就是退居养老院，而他还在周游世界。在世界各国的首都，几乎没有一扇大门不向他敞开.这简直是太了不起了,基辛格在权力的殿堂里经久不衰，即使他是持访客通行证进入，也很引人注目。

“Few people were better students of history — even fewer people did more to shape history — than Henry Kissinger,” Mr. Blinken said while in Israel emulating Kissingerian shuttle diplomacy.While he was readily given visitor’s passes to the halls of power, he was still reviled by many liberals as a war criminal and by many conservatives as an appeaser.But even if critics were laying into him, at least they were listening. Mr. Kissinger always wanted to be paid attention to.
布林肯在以色列模仿基辛格的穿梭外交时说：“很少有人在以史为鉴方面比得上基辛格，而在塑造历史方面，更是没有几个人能超越他。”虽然他很容易获得进入权力大厅的通行证，但他仍被许多自由派人士斥为战犯，被许多保守派人士斥为绥靖者。但是，尽管被批评者大骂，这至少意味着他们是在听的。基辛格一直希望得到关注。

And he could be characteristically Machiavellian even into his 90s. When Donald J. Trump came to power, Mr. Kissinger advised nervous German officials seeking reassurance about the new president to meet with Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser. But unknown to the Germans, Mr. Kissinger had told Mr. Kushner that the allies were nervous about Mr. Trump and that he should use that to his own advantage. Don’t reassure them, he advised — keep them on edge.Still, he was indefatigable. 
即便年逾九十，基辛格可能仍是典型的马基雅维利主义者。特朗普上台后，紧张的德国官员对于这位新总统颇为担忧，基辛格建议他们与特朗普的女婿兼高级顾问库什纳会面。但德国人不知道的是，基辛格已经告诉库什纳，盟国都对特朗普感到不安，但特朗普应该好好利用这一点。他的建议是，别安抚他们，就让他们如坐针毡。无论怎样，他不知疲倦。
