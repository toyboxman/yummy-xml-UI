The United States and its allies make the most advanced tools for both precision metalworking and semiconductor manufacturing. The U.S. government’s efforts to stop Russia and China from using American equipment to boost their defense sectors have resulted in tough rules — but leaky enforcement. Right now, the Commerce Department tries to enforce export controls by knocking on companies’ doors to see if they’ve violated any rules. 
美国及其盟友生产精密金属加工和半导体制造所需的顶级设备。为了阻止俄罗斯和中国利用美国设备来加强国防实力，美国政府制定了严格的规定，但在执行上却漏洞百出。目前，美国商务部试图通过实地访问的方式来实施出口管制，看看它们是否存在违反相关规定的情况。

We cannot expect foxes, even U.S.-incorporated ones, to guard the henhouse. We believe that some Western firms may prefer not to know too much about their customers, lest it becomes harder for them to turn a blind eye. What’s more, companies face commercial incentives to guarantee the confidentiality of customers’ data. Because of this, self-policing has been a failure.
我们不能指望狐狸看守鸡舍，哪怕是在美国注册的狐狸也不行。我们相信，一些西方公司可能并不愿意对客户有过多了解，以便他们睁只眼闭只眼。此外，企业还面临着保证客户数据机密性的商业动机。正因为如此，自我监管一直难以奏效。

So how can the West tighten enforcement of these rules? Companies making controlled tools should be mandated to install tamperproof geolocation in them. An Apple AirTag costs less than $30. Manufacturers of million-dollar tools can surely find a cost-effective way of incorporating government-approved geolocation into their dual-use devices and providing real-time verification to the Commerce Department.
那么，西方要如何强化规定的执行层面呢？应该强制要求制造受控设备的企业在产品中安装防篡改的定位装置。苹果AirTag的价格不到30美元。这些生产价值数百万美元的设备的厂商肯定能找到一种经济有效的方式，将政府批准的定位功能整合到它们的军民两用设备中，并向商务部提供实时验证。

Footage from the attack showed the assailant approaching Mr. Lee through a group of TV cameramen, apparently posing as one of his supporters; he was wearing crown-shaped headgear bearing Mr. Lee’s name. Supporters and police officers overpowered the man after the attack and took him to a police car.
袭击画面显示，袭击者混在一群电视摄影师中接近李在明，显然假扮成了他的支持者；他当时戴着皇冠形状的头饰，上面印着李在明的名字。袭击发生后，支持者和警察将该男子制服并将他带上警车。

Its economists speak of a “crowd-in effect,” which happens when, for instance, a new port next to a shiny new industrial park lures companies into building plants and hiring workers. Last year, the bank said it anticipated an imminent crowding-in, as it has forecast for almost three years running.
世界银行的经济学家称其为“挤入效应”，例如，当一个新港口毗邻一个崭新的工业园区时，就会吸引公司建厂和雇佣工人。去年，该银行表示，预计即将出现大量挤入，过去将近三年它一直在给出这样的预测。

On the one hand, business craves stability in political leadership, and India has rarely, if ever, had such a well-entrenched leader. He demolished the main opposition party in three big elections across the Hindi-speaking heartland in December and looks like a shoo-in for re-election this year. And Mr. Modi is vocally pro-business.But he remains hopeful. The annual growth, even if less than 6 percent, is nothing to sniff at. 
一方面，商界渴望政治领导层的稳定，而印度很少出现这样一位稳固的领导人。去年12月，他在讲印地语的印度核心地区的三场重大选举中摧毁了主要反对党，今年似乎有望连任。并且莫迪也是商业的积极倡导者。但他仍然充满希望。年增长率即使低于6%，也不容小觑。

And now, with a new mayor about to be sworn in to lead the city of 1.6 million, and a package of legislation related to the Sixers’ arena expected soon, the project is entering a pivotal stretch.To Chinatown’s champions, the proposed arena fits a pattern of land grabs, paving the way for yet another sports development project. 
现在，随着领导这座拥有160万人口城市的新市长准备宣誓就职，以及有关76人队主场球馆的一系列立法即将出台，这一建设项目的推进也进入了关键阶段。对唐人街的捍卫者来说，拟建中的球馆符合一种土地掠夺模式，为又一处体育开发项目铺平道路

Chinatowns often sprouted in what were the cheapest, least desirable precincts, born of racism and xenophobia. But the same urban enclaves have become so coveted that their longtime inhabitants are being displaced. But to the Sixers, construction unions and some business leaders, the arena promises to create jobs and revitalize an uninviting stretch of downtown Philadelphia, the nation’s poorest big city, that is just a 15-minute walk from Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell.
由于种族主义和仇外心理等原因，唐人街通常位于城里曾经最便宜、最不吸引人的街区。但这些地方现在已变得如此令人垂涎，以至于那里的长期居民正在被新来者取代。但对76人队、建筑工会和一些商界领袖来说，建设球馆有望创造就业机会，并使费城这座美国最贫穷的大城市市中心的一处无吸引力的街区重获生机，从这里到独立厅和自由钟仅15分钟的步行路程。

The resignation of Harvard’s president, Claudine Gay, on Tuesday followed a lengthening catalog of plagiarism allegations that appeared to steadily sap her support among the university’s faculty, students and alumni. But for many of Dr. Gay’s critics, her departure was also a proxy victory in the escalating ideological battle over American higher education.
随着有关哈佛校长克劳丁·盖伊论文抄袭的指控不断增多，渐渐消磨了教员、学生和校友们对她的支持，她于周二宣布辞职。然而对许多盖伊的批评者来说，她的离职还意味着他们在围绕美国高等教育的一场日益升级的意识形态斗争中取得了一个间接的胜利。

To the extent those problems have been exposed, and skepticism increases towards the current best instantiation of higher education, I think that puts a lot of wind in the sails of reform.
问题大到已经暴露出来，对当今高等教育顶尖典范的怀疑在增加，我认为这给改革提供了不少助力。

Now that Dr. Gay is out (following M. Elizabeth Magill of the University of Pennsylvania, who resigned shortly after the hearing), there is more than enough context to go around. Her career, until last July a steady, brisk climb through faculty and administrative ranks to the pinnacle of American higher education, has become a punditic bonanza and a culture-war Rorschach test.
现在盖伊已经出局（宾夕法尼亚大学的M·伊丽莎白·马吉尔在听证会后没多久就辞职了），有足够多可供我们热议的语境。直到去年7月以前，她的职业生涯一直平步青云，从教工到行政，最终登上美国高等教育的巅峰，如今却成了坊间的一个谈资，这场文化战争的一项罗夏墨渍测验

Higher learning is plagued by opaque admissions policies; runaway tuition costs; administrative bloat; grade inflation; helicopter parents; cancel culture. The list goes on. An assiduous scholar might connect these phenomena with recent events in Harvard Yard. An enterprising writer could weave the whole thing into a bristling campus novel, something worthy of Paul Beatty or Mary McCarthy.
高等教育深受不透明的录取政策的困扰；天价学费；行政机构臃肿；学分通胀；直升机父母；取消文化。还有很多很多。有心的学者可能会把这些现象与哈佛园近来的一些事件联系起来。锐意进取的作家可以把整件事写进一部令人怒发冲冠的校园小说里，堪与保罗·比蒂或玛丽·麦卡锡媲美。

In video footage of the JAL plane’s landing, it appeared to be lined in flames as it plunged down the runway, making it difficult to believe anyone could have made it off the flight unscathed.Those 18 minutes, he said, included a glide of about two-thirds of a mile down the runway before the plane came to a stop and the evacuation slides could unfurl.
在日航班机降落的视频画面中，飞机似乎在着陆瞬间就燃起大火，令人难以置信机上能有人成功逃生。 在这18分钟里，飞机在跑道上滑行了大约1.2公里后停止，随后逃生滑梯才得以放出。

Firewalls around the engines, nitrogen pumps in fuel tanks that help prevent immediate burning, and fire-resistant materials on seats and flooring most likely helped to keep the rising flames at bay. Having a level of fire resistance makes the initial progression slower, If we have things that reduce the spread, we can increase the chance of getting everybody off safely.
包裹发动机的防火墙和油箱里的氮泵有助于防止立即燃烧，座位和地板使用的防火材料也是阻止火焰上升的主要原因。一定程度的防火性能可以延缓（火灾）的初始进程，如果有办法减少火情蔓延，那每个人安全逃生的概率也会增加。

North Korea is not a monarchy, but it has had dynastic leadership since the end of World War II. Its top leader is supposedly elected through a ruling Workers’ Party congress. In reality, though, the Kims have run the country like a private family enterprise since its founding.
虽然朝鲜不是君主制国家，但自第二次世界大战结束以来一直是王朝式统治。朝鲜最高领导人按说是由执政的劳动党的代表大会选举产生。但实际上，金氏自建国以来一直像管理一个私人家族企业那样统治国家。

Taiwan has, so far at least, experienced none of the alarm that gripped many Americans last year when a hulking Chinese high-altitude surveillance balloon floated across the United States. China denied that the balloon was for spying, but Washington did not buy that line, and the dispute soured relations for many months.
至少到目前为止，台湾还没有经历美国人去年表现出的恐慌，当时一个巨大的中国高空监测气球飘越了美国大陆上空。中国否认该气球具备间谍性质，但华盛顿不相信这个说法，这场争端使两国关系在长达数月时间里进一步恶化。

Taiwanese people are used to Chinese military flights near the island, and news of the balloons has generally been met with calm, if not indifference.The balloon flights may, nonetheless, be part of the “gray zone” tactics that China uses to warn Taiwan of its military strength and options, without tipping into baldfaced confrontation.
台湾民众已经习惯了中国在台湾附近的军事飞行，对气球出现的消息普遍反应平静，甚至漠不关心。尽管如此，放飞气球仍可能是中国“灰色地带”策略的一部分，该战略就其自身军事实力和能力向台湾发出警告，又不至于导致赤裸裸的对抗。

Humans have searched for the secret to immortality for thousands of years. For some people today, that quest includes things like sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber, experimenting with cryotherapy or blasting oneself with infrared light.
几千年来，人类一直在寻找长生不老的秘密。对于今天的一些人来说，这种探索包括睡高压氧舱，实验冷冻疗法，或者用红外线照射自己。

The quickest route to ports on the U.S. East Coast from China is through the Panama Canal. But shipping companies that avoided that canal because of the drought must now sail for even longer as they detour around the Cape of Good Hope. The Cape journey takes 10 days longer, or some 40 percent more, than traveling through the Panama Canal, Flexport calculates.
从中国到美国东海岸港口的最快航线是走巴拿马运河。但因干旱而避开该运河的航运公司如今必须绕行好望角，耗费更长时间。飞协博计算得出，走好望角要比走巴拿马运河多花10天，也就是多出约40%的时间

Taken together, the dynamic with Iran is more complex than at any point since the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in 1979 after the overthrow of the shah. U.S. and European intelligence officials say they do not believe the Iranians want a direct conflict with the United States or Israel, which they suspect would not end well. But they seem more than willing to push the envelope, enabling attacks, coordinating targeting of U.S. bases and ships carrying goods and fuel, and walking to the edge, again, of nuclear weapons capability.
总而言之，自1979年伊朗国王被推翻后的美使馆占领事件以来，伊朗问题走到了最复杂的节点。欧美情报官员表示，他们不认为伊朗愿与美国或以色列发生直接冲突，因为担心这种冲突不会有好结果。但伊朗似乎非常乐于挑战底线，发动袭击，与其他势力协同打击美军基地和运载货物燃料的船舶，并再次走到即将拥有核武器能力的边缘。

In the minutes preceding the emergency landing, with oxygen masks dangling from the ceiling and the wind howling through the gaping hole in the wall, passengers could not hear urgent announcements made over the public address system.
在紧急迫降前的几分钟里，舱顶悬吊的氧气面罩摇摇摆摆，狂风从侧面的大洞呼啸而入，乘客们听不到广播系统发出的紧急通知。

The Chinese regulator separately announced on Friday that Tesla would transmit updated computer software to 7,538 imported Model S and Model X electric cars to fix a programming difficulty that could cause door latches to unlock on the far side of the car from a collision.
中国监管机构上周五还宣布，特斯拉将为7538辆进口的Model S和Model X电动汽车进行远程软件升级，以解决一个软件问题，该问题导致撞车时远侧车门的锁闩与锁扣脱离。

He accused some institutions of operating the “diploma equivalent of puppy mills,” depriving those foreign students of a positive academic experience in the face of outsize hardships and a lack of intervention by provincial governments.
他指责一些院校经营“相当于幼犬犬舍的文凭工厂”，剥夺了外国留学生积极的学术体验，让他们面临特别大的困难，而省级政府却不出面干预。

Pressurization starts to affect most commercial planes around 8,000 feet, said Mr. Brickhouse, who previously investigated aviation accidents for the safety board. Not properly controlling the air entering and leaving the cabin can lead to altitude sickness, or hypoxia, among passengers and the crew.This is why flight attendant tell passengers to use drop-down masks in the event of rapid decompression.In a statement, the F.A.A. said the required inspections would focus on the plugs, door components and fasteners.
布里克豪斯此前曾代表安全委员会调查过航空事故，他表示，大多商用飞机都会在2400米左右的高度开始受到增压影响。如果不能妥善控制机舱内空气的进出流动，可能会导致乘客和机组人员出现高原反应或缺氧。这也是为什么空乘人员会告诉乘客要在快速减压时使用下拉式氧气罩。空管局在声明中表示，需要检查的重点包括门塞、舱门组件和紧固件。

The failure to notify Congress of his inability to perform his duties was a clear violation of the law,It remains unclear who decided to ignore federal law, but there must be accountability. An internal review — ordered by the same chief of staff who played a part in this crisis — is woefully inadequate.Mr. Kirby confirmed that the White House likewise did not know that the Dec. 22 procedure involved surgery under general anesthesia, which normally would trigger the transfer of a defense secretary’s power to his deputy.
没有通知国会他无法履行职责，这显然违反了法律，目前还不清楚是谁决定无视联邦法律，但必须追究责任。由在这场危机中发挥过作用的同一位幕僚长下令进行的内部审查，是远远不够的。柯比证实，白宫也不知道12月22日的手术是在全身麻醉下进行的，通常情况下，这种手术会导致国防部长将权力移交给副手。

Mr. Austin was brought back to the hospital on Jan. 1 after experiencing nausea with “severe abdominal, hip, and leg pain,” according to the doctors, who determined that he had developed a urinary tract infection.For days, White House officials pressed the Pentagon to disclose more about the medical issues and were flabbergasted that it took so long. The Pentagon then made the secretary’s hospitalization public on Friday evening in a bare-bones statement.
据医生说，1月1日，奥斯汀在出现恶心、“腹部、臀部和腿部严重疼痛”后被送回医院，医生们确定他患上了尿路感染。几天来，白宫官员敦促五角大楼披露更多有关医疗问题的信息，对五角大楼拖了这么长的时间感到震惊。五角大楼随后在周五晚上发表了一份简短的声明，公开了国防部长住院的消息。

While Mr. Biden has been described as understanding, people close to the White House recounted a deep frustration and bafflement among some on the president’s team. Mr. Austin, a reserved retired general, does not have a particularly intimate relationship with Mr. Biden or his team, but he is well liked and deeply respected, making the situation all the more upsetting to them.
虽然旁人述称拜登理解此事，但接近白宫的人士称，总统团队中的一些人深感不满和困惑。奥斯汀是一位沉默寡言的退役将军，他与拜登及其团队的关系并不特别亲密，但他很受欢迎，也很受尊敬，这让他们更加不安。

Democracy, which spread globally after the end of the Cold War, faces mounting challenges worldwide — from mass migration to climate disruption, from economic inequities to war. The struggle in many countries to respond adequately to such tests has eroded confidence in liberal, pluralistic societies, opening the door to appeals from populists and strongman leaders.
从大规模移民到气候破坏，从经济不平等到战争，“冷战”后盛行全球的民主制度正面临世界范围内日益严峻的挑战。许多国家在妥善应对这些考验时遭遇的困境削弱了人们对自由多元社会的信心，民粹主义者和强人领袖因而有了民意基础。

And yet efforts by social media companies to limit toxic content, which escalated after the American presidential election in 2016, have recently tapered off, if not reversed entirely.The companies are starting the year with “little bandwidth, very little accountability in writing and billions of people around the world turning to these platforms for information” — not ideal for safeguarding democracy
社交媒体公司限制有害内容的努力曾在2016年美国总统大选后升级，然而最近已经逐渐减弱，甚至完全逆转。这些公司在新的一年开始时“带宽很少，书面问责制很弱，而全球数十亿人在这些平台获取信息”——这不是维护民主的理想选择。

The campaigning has mostly gone smoothly but not entirely so: As a gimmick, one Taiwanese party handed out 460,000 laundry detergent pods to win support. Some voters unfortunately mistook the pods for food. one of my minders made a vague inquiry about paying me — apparently to see if a Times correspondent could be bribed.
竞选的过程基本顺利，但也不是没有岔子：其中一个台湾政党为了争取支持，想出了分发46万个洗衣凝珠的噱头。不幸的是一些选民把它们当食物吃了下去。一个接待我的人向我委婉地提出可以付钱给我——看来他认为，一名时报记者是可以收买的。

Huang Chen-yu strode onto an outdoor stage in a southern Taiwanese county, whooping and hollering as she roused the crowd of 20,000 into a joyous frenzy — to welcome a succession of politicians in matching jackets.She had some advice for preserving vocal cords through as many as three rallies in a day: “If you don’t use your abdominal strength, you will be ruined after one show.”
在台湾南部的一个县，黄贞瑜大步走上一处露天舞台，她高兴地大喊大叫，将台下两万名群众带入了快乐的疯狂状态，欢迎身穿相同颜色夹克衫、鱼贯上台的政治人物们。对如何在一天最多有三场集会的情况下保护好嗓子，她有些建议：“如果你不用丹田，大概一场就毁了。”

A drumroll when a candidate was introduced. Ominous electro-orchestra at the mention of the opposition. A clash of cymbals to mark the punchline of a joke.Some performers and technicians work to support their party; others, including Mr. Wang, do it for whichever side pays.Still, age is catching up on the rallies. 
介绍候选人时响起的是鼓声。提到竞选对手时是阴沉的电子管弦乐声。打击乐则标记笑话的高潮笑点。一些表演者和技术人员为集会工作是为了支持他们所在的政党；也有人（包括王先生）只要给钱就干活。尽管如此，参与集会者的年龄越来越大。

If we cannot hold onto these achievements and instead turn back, then I’m afraid that the lifelong struggles and striving of my contemporaries will be in vain.That resistance led to the meeting in 1986, in the unlikely setting of the Grand Hotel Taipei overlooking Taipei. The ornate hotel was established as a symbol of Chiang Kai-shek’s authoritarian rule — he and his wife had their own set of rooms inside.Activists had booked the room on the flimsy pretext that they were a dentists’ association.Chinese officials characterize him as an untrustworthy, unreconstructed supporter of independence for Taiwan. 
如果我们守不住这个成果，又回头，这一辈子跟我们同辈人的这种努力，我们怕化为泡影。他们的抵抗运动催生了1986年的那场会议，地点在俯瞰台北的圆山大饭店，一个跟会议不太搭配的地方。这间富丽堂皇的酒店本是蒋介石专制统治的象征——他与他的妻子在这里拥有专享的套房.活动人士以牙医联谊会这一信口胡诌的名义预定了房间。中国官员认为，他是一个不值得信任、顽固的台独分子。

Olive groves have shriveled in Tunisia. The Brazilian Amazon faces its driest season in a century. Wheat fields have been decimated in Syria and Iraq, pushing millions more into hunger after years of conflict. The Panama Canal, a vital trade artery, doesn’t have enough water, which means fewer ships can pass through. And the fear of drought has prompted India, the world’s biggest rice exporter, to restrict the export of most rice varieties.
突尼斯的橄榄树林已经枯萎。巴西亚马孙河面临百年来最干旱的季节。叙利亚和伊拉克的麦田遭到严重毁坏，使数以百万计的人在多年冲突后陷入饥饿。重要的贸易大动脉巴拿马运河没有足够的水，这意味着可以通过的船只减少。对干旱的恐惧促使印度这个世界上最大的大米出口国限制了多数大米品种的出口。

Rice is acutely vulnerable to the weather, and governments are, in turn, acutely vulnerable to fluctuations in rice prices. This helps to explain why Indonesia, facing elections this year, moved to shore up rice imports recently. India’s rice export ban is a precautionary measure. The government has long kept large stocks in reserve and offered rice to its poor at deep discounts. 
大米极易受到天气影响，反过来，政府也极易受到大米价格波动影响。这有助于解释为什么今年面临大选的印尼最近采取行动加强大米进口。印度的大米出口禁令是一种预防措施。长期以来，印度政府储备了大量大米，并以极低的折扣向穷人提供大米。

That’s bad for small farmers in those regions, many of whom already live hand-to-mouth and are struggling with already high food prices.Brazil’s drought poses more far-reaching dangers, too. A healthy Amazon rainforest is a huge storehouse of carbon, but not if heat and drought kill trees and fuel wildfires. 
对这些地区的小农户来说尤为不利的是，他们中的许多人过着勉强糊口的生活，勉为其难地应付着本来就已经很高的食品价格。巴西的干旱还带来了更深远的危险。健康的亚马孙雨林是一个巨大的储碳库，但如果炎热和干旱导致树木枯死，野火肆虐，情况就不是这样了。

Often overlooked in an increasingly blue-collar party, voters with a college degree remain at the heart of the lingering Republican cold war over abortion, foreign policy and cultural issues.DeSantis’ advisers viewed the party’s educational divide as a potential launching point to overtake Trump for the nomination
在这个日益蓝领化的政党中，拥有大学学历的选民经常遭到忽视，然而在围绕堕胎、外交政策和文化问题的一场连绵不绝的共和党冷战里，这些人仍然是核心。德桑蒂斯的顾问认为，共和党内受教育程度的鸿沟是他超越特朗普获得提名的潜在起点

Then came Trump’s resurgence, in which he rallied every corner of the party, including the white working class. This phenomenon cuts against years of wariness toward Trump by college-educated Republicans, unnerved by his 2020 election lies and his seemingly endless craving for controversy.
然后，特朗普卷土重来，他团结了共和党内的每一个角落，包括白人工薪阶层。这种现象与受过大学教育的共和党人多年来对特朗普的警惕相悖，对于特朗普在2020年大选中的谎言和他似乎无休止地渴望争议，他们曾经感到不安。

“If we’re going off the way polls are right now, that’s the way I feel. My vote would be going into thin air,” Shaw said. “The country was really running smooth under him. I think that the economy was a crap-ton better — we weren’t paying $6 a carton for eggs.”
“按现在民调这个走势，我就是这样感觉的。我的票等于打水漂了，”肖说。“这个国家在他手底下一帆风顺。我认为经济可是好太多了——那时候可不会买盒鸡蛋都要六块钱。”

First, a blizzard forced a slew of event cancellations. Then, subzero temperatures and a numbing windchill on Monday spurred warnings of “life-threatening cold” from the National Weather Service.But supporters of Mr. Trump, who describes his followers as part of a broader “MAGA movement,” nonetheless turned out, animated by his dark portrait of a nation in decline and apocalyptic rhetoric about wresting a country controlled by the left back from the brink. 
首先，暴风雪迫使一系列活动取消。然后，在周一，华氏零度以下的气温和刺骨寒风促使美国国家气象局发出了“危及生命的低温天气”警告。但被特朗普称为“恢复美国伟大荣光运动”一份子的支持者还是冒着严寒参加了初选。他对美国衰落的黑暗描绘，以及将由左翼控制的美国从悬崖边缘拉回来的危言，激励着这些支持者们。

Yet Chinese industrial policy spending still far outstrips that of the United States. Facing an economic slowdown and a gradual bursting of the property bubble, the Chinese government has recently redoubled efforts to promote exports and support its factory sector.Some of China’s success stems from its larger market — which gives Chinese firms the scale and opportunity to hone their products — along with its vast pool of talented engineers.
但中国的产业政策性支出仍远超美国。面对经济放缓和房地产泡沫逐渐破裂的困局，中国政府近来已进一步加大力度推动出口增长，并支持制造部门的生产。中国成功的部分原因在于其更大的市场为中国企业提供了打磨产品的规模和机会，同时中国还拥有庞大的工程师人才队伍。

Western economists predict that growth will be 4.5 percent or less this year, the result not of a cyclical downturn but of a grinding decline that may endure for many years, what economists label secular stagnation. Prices are gradually falling to an extent that China hadn’t experienced since the jolt inflicted by the global financial crisis in 2009, a phenomenon known as deflation that could bankrupt heavily indebted families and companies.
西方经济学家预测中国今年的增长率将在4.5%或更低，这反映的并非周期性下行，而是一场可能持续多年的缓慢衰落，经济学家称之为长期停滞。物价正在逐渐下跌至中国自2009年全球金融危机以来的最低水平，这种通货紧缩现象可能令负债累累的家庭和企业陷入破产境地。

Secular stagnation — basically a chronic excess of savings leading to slow growth, deflation, asset bubbles and financial strains — has moved from the Western Hemisphere to China.Multinational retailers are finishing the sale of excess inventories they accumulated at the end of the pandemic and have begun placing new orders.China’s exports are likely to explode to the upside,All over China, car factories are being built in a frenzy. 
长期停滞——基本就是长期储蓄过剩导致的增长缓慢、通货紧缩、资产泡沫和金融压力——已从西半球转移到了中国，跨国零售商在疫情结束时囤积的过剩库存即将售空，并已开始下新的订单。中国出口很有可能出现井喷式增长,中国各地都在大力投建汽车厂。

The Korean Peninsula was divided into the pro​-Soviet North and the pro-U.S. South​ at the end of World War II. The two Koreas fought the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, which ended in a truce, leaving the two nations technically in an ongoing state of war. If the North provokes, we will exact manifold retaliation, Its threat to us to ‘choose between war and peace’ will no longer work.The North has faced self-contradiction when it threatened to level ​and use its nuclear weapons ​against fellow countrymen
第二次世界大战结束时，朝鲜半岛被分割成亲苏联的朝鲜和亲美国的韩国，并曾在1950年至1953年间爆发战争，最后以休战告终。严格地说，两国仍处于战争状态。一旦朝鲜发起挑衅，韩方将加倍反制，朝鲜要挟我们‘在战争与和平之间做出选择’再也行不通。当朝鲜威胁要对同胞使用核武器时，它已面临一种自相矛盾

He was ostensibly a movement leader in exile, simmering in Florida, his flailing election lies confined to private monologues and modest platforms. He was no longer appearing on Fox News, the most powerful media organ of the right.His screeds on Truth Social did not land with the force of their tweeted predecessors.
表面上看，他已经是一名被流放的运动领袖，在佛罗里达发散着怒气，他对那些选举谎言的宣扬也仅限于私下里的自言自语，或在相对冷清的平台。在右翼最强大的媒体机构福克斯新闻的画面中，已经看不到他的身影。他在Truth Social上的长篇大论已经不像此前的推文那么虎虎生风。

But with his landslide victory in Iowa, codifying his double-fisted hold on wide swaths of the Republican electorate, two conclusions were inescapable by Tuesday morning.His detractors own no earplugs effective enough to block that out.
然而随着他在艾奥瓦州取得一边倒的胜利，明确他对广大共和党选区的牢牢掌控，到了周二上午，有两个结论已经是板上钉钉。反感他的人再怎么捂住耳朵，届时也将不得不面对现实。

After a White House term that often consumed the national psyche hour by hour — stirring his supporters and panicking his critics with each wayward post and norm-busting impulse, culminating in the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob on Jan. 6, 2021 — some Trump-fatigued members of both parties and the political press seemed at times to be wishing him away, as if media oxygen alone had sustained him the last eight years.
他的总统任期时常引起举国上下目不转睛的关注。他发出的每一条文字、每一次突发奇想地打破常规都让支持者沸腾，让批评者惊慌，最终发展到2021年1月6日一群支持特朗普的暴徒袭击国会。在此之后，厌倦了特朗普的两党人士和政治媒体似乎经常在祈愿他能消失，仿佛过去八年他完全是靠媒体氧气撑下来的。

The result should lay to rest any doubt about the direction in which Taiwan is going. Conflict between China and the United States just got a little more likely.This hardening in Taiwanese attitudes has been a long time coming. In 1949, China’s former Kuomintang (K.M.T.) government lost a civil war against Communist Chinese forces and fled to Taiwan, dividing the two sides. 
台湾未来将何去何从，这次大选的结果应该能消除所有的疑问了。中美之间发生冲突的可能性又增加了一分。台湾人越来越强硬的态度是长时间形成的。曾经统治中国的国民党政府在内战失败后，于1949年逃到了台湾，导致两岸分离。

Wit said that a recent incident in which North Korea fired artillery shells near waters disputed with South Korea “sent chills down my spine” because it seemed a possible rehearsal for a major provocation.
威特说，最近朝鲜在与韩国有争议的水域附近发射炮弹的事件“让我不寒而栗”，因为这似乎是一次重大挑衅的预演。

But the U.S. repository, which was designed to help scientists share run-of-the-mill research data, never added the submission it received on Dec. 28, 2019, to its database.Why would you allow this sequence to sit there under the same process as a sequence I just got from a new snail species I found in a ravine?
但是，这个旨在帮助科学家共享普通研究数据的美国知识库从未将它于2019年12月28日收到的材料添加到数据库中。为什么这个序列会与我刚从峡谷中发现的一种新蜗牛物种身上获得的序列放在相同的流程里？

The women went to election rallies and talked to politicians and voters, as well as homeless people and other disadvantaged groups. It was an emotional trip filled with envy, admiration, tears and revelations.That seems like a lifetime ago. 
她们去了选举集会，与政客和选民交谈，还接触了无家可归者和其他弱势群体。这是一场饱含羡慕、钦佩、泪水和启发的动人之旅。如今回望恍如隔世。

At Jing-Mei White Terror Memorial Park, the former prison, it was easy for the group to picture how people had spent their time in crowded, humid and shabby cells and washed their clothes in toilets. Everyone knew that was true. Still, it was deflating for them to hear. But their despair didn’t last long.
在原为看守所的白色恐怖景美纪念园区，她们不难想象这里的人曾如何在拥挤潮湿的破旧牢房中度日，并在厕所里清洗衣物。虽然都知道他说的是事实，听到这话她们还是很泄气。但这种绝望并没有持续太久。

Ms. Haley finished a disappointing third in Monday’s Iowa caucuses but is facing what polls suggest is more favorable terrain in New Hampshire, where unaffiliated voters can cast ballots in the primary. In New Hampshire, the Trump campaign is trying to engage what one adviser called a “pincer” — squeezing Ms. Haley from both ends of the ideological spectrum.An advertising campaign began lacing into her on immigration (hitting her from the right) before criticizing her for wanting to raise the retirement age for Social Security (hitting her from the left).  
黑利在艾奥瓦州周一的预选中位居第三，这是个令人失望的结果，但民意调查显示，她在新罕布什尔州面临更有利的形势，因为无党派选民可在该州初选中投票. 在新罕布什尔州，特朗普的竞选活动正试图采用被一名顾问描述为“钳形”的攻势，也就是从意识形态的两端攻击黑利。一场广告攻势先是在移民问题上攻击她（从右翼进攻），然后批评她要提高拿社会保障金的退休年龄（从左翼进攻）

The Koch network went ahead with its endorsement of Ms. Haley and put its expensive ground operation into her service, sweeping out across Iowa and New Hampshire in a last-minute sprint of door knocking.Mr. Trump, who out of superstition has long avoided discussing who might serve in his administration, has begun indulging discussions of who might serve alongside him.Mr. Trump told the audience that he had Mr. Burgum pegged for an important role in his administration.
科赫网络还是选择了支持黑利，并用其高成本的地面行动为她提供帮助，向艾奥瓦州和新罕布什尔州各地派出大量人员，在初选前的最后一刻挨家挨户动员选民。出于迷信，特朗普长期以来一直避免讨论什么人可能在他的政府中任职，他现已开始听任谁可能会与他一起为政府工作的讨论。特朗普对台下的观众说，他觉得布尔古姆能在下届政府中起重要作用。

As he appeared onstage with Mr. Trump at a rally in Atkinson, N.H., on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump grinned broadly as the crowd chanted, “V.P., V.P., V.P.”  It was a whiplash reversal that’s typical of Mr. Trump. Two days earlier, he had attacked Mr. Ramaswamy as “not MAGA.”
拉马斯瓦米周二晚与特朗普一起出现在新罕布什尔州阿特金森的一个集会上时，人群发出了“副总统、副总统、副总统”的呼声，特朗普咧嘴大笑。这是典型的特朗普猛烈逆转。两天前，他还在攻击拉马斯瓦米“不MAGA”

No defection was more emblematic of the shift than that of Senator Mike Lee of Utah. Mr. Lee was an early booster of Mr. DeSantis’s presidential run.Mr. Lee did not give Mr. DeSantis a heads up before he announced that he was endorsing Mr. Trump just three days before the Iowa caucuses, that person said. The DeSantis team saw the timing as a knife in the back.
没有比犹他州参议员迈克·李的转变更有代表性了。李曾是德桑蒂斯竞选总统的早期支持者，李在艾奥瓦州举行初选的三天前宣布支持特朗普，而且没有提前告知德桑蒂斯。德桑蒂斯团队认为选择这个时机是背后插刀。

Singapore has long touted a squeaky clean image and a lack of graft. But in recent months, several scandals have tarnished the governing People’s Action Party’s reputation — and, in effect, the country’s. One can’t deny that this is a body blow to the P.A.P., to the government and to Singapore
新加坡的清正廉洁向来为人所称道。但近几个月，执政的人民行动党——乃至整个国家——的清誉已经被多桩丑闻玷污。不得不说，这对行动党、政府乃至新加坡是一次沉重的打击

In addition to Mr. Iswaran’s case, the P.A.P. last year faced questions of impropriety in the real estate dealings of two ministers involving government bungalows, and pertaining to the speaker of Parliament’s extramarital affair with another lawmaker.Singapore has consistently been lauded for its lack of graft. 
除了易华仁，行动党去年还有两名部长因涉及政府洋房的房地产不当交易问题受到指责，以及国会议长与另一位议员的婚外情丑闻。新加坡的廉政一直备受赞誉。

I am determined to uphold the integrity of the party and the government, and our reputation for honesty and incorruptibility,Singaporeans expect no less.The P.A.P. stance on corruption is non-negotiable, this is part of our DNA,There can be no compromise, no relaxation, no fudging on this, no matter the political price.
我决心维护党和政府的诚信，以及我们廉洁诚实的声誉，新加坡人也期望如此。人民行动党对腐败的立场是不容动摇的。这是我党基因的一部分，无论付出什么样的政治代价，都不会对贪污问题做出任何妥协和放松。

In 2023, the U.S. economy vastly outperformed expectations. A widely predicted recession never happened. Many economists (though not me) argued that getting inflation down would require years of high unemployment; instead, we’ve experienced immaculate disinflation, rapidly falling inflation at no visible cost.So let’s not gloat about China’s economic stumble, which may become everyone’s problem.
2023年，美国经济的表现远远超出预期。人们普遍预测的经济衰退并未发生。许多经济学家（虽然不是我）认为，要降低通胀，需要多年的高失业率；相反，我们经历了无懈可击的通货紧缩，通胀率迅速下降，却没有付出明显的代价。因此，我们不要对中国的经济下滑幸灾乐祸，这可能会成为所有人的问题。

The main factor holding back international travel by Chinese will continue to be China’s economy. Growth has bounced back from the pandemic, but the weight of a severe real estate downturn has dampened consumer spending and confidence inside China. And global geopolitical tensions remain a wild card. China is engaged in trade disputes with the United States and Europe
阻碍中国人出国旅游的主要因素仍将是中国经济。中国经济增长已经从疫情中反弹，但房地产严重低迷的压力抑制了中国国内的消费者支出和信心。全球地缘政治紧张局势仍是不确定因素。中国正与许多大型跨国公司所在的美国和欧洲陷入贸易争端

Aerial footage of the disaster site from the state broadcaster, China Central Television, showed a dark, gaping furrow gouged out of a snowy mountainside, which had carved through wide swaths of terraced fields and into a cluster of low houses.Hundreds of workers were climbing over snow-dusted rubble to rescue the missing residents.The cause of the landslide in Yunnan, and whether it was related to the cold snap, were not immediately clear. The climate in that part of Yunnan is typically subtropical
中央电视台播放的灾难现场航拍画面显示，泥石流在覆盖着白雪的山坡上冲出一条深色的裂沟，穿过大片梯田，将一片低矮的房屋覆盖。数百名救援人员爬上被雪覆盖的废墟，搜救失联居民.目前尚不清楚云南山体滑坡的原因，也不知道滑坡是否与寒潮有关。云南该地区通常是亚热带气候

In throwing his support to Mr. Trump, Mr. DeSantis seemed to be trying to unite the conservative wing of the party behind the former president while ignoring the fact that he was bending the knee to a man who had ridiculed him as if it were a blood sport.Last year, he signed a six-week abortion ban in Florida that outlawed the procedure at a time before many women know they are pregnant. Mr. Trump criticized the law as too harsh, and Mr. DeSantis tried to use abortion as a wedge issue to sway conservative Christians away from the former president.
德桑蒂斯支持特朗普，似乎是想把党内保守派团结在这位前总统身后，同时假装不知道自己正在向一个百般羞辱他的对手屈膝，在这个对手眼里，这场选战仿佛斗兽场里的血腥厮杀。去年，他在佛罗里达州签署了一项禁止怀孕后六周堕胎的禁令，然而在六周这个时间段里，许多女性可能还不知道自己已经怀孕。特朗普批评该法律过于严厉，德桑蒂斯试图利用堕胎作为一个楔子，动摇保守派基督徒对这位前总统的支持。

So in 2016, prison officials finally allowed volunteers to come care for the cats. A Chilean organization called the Felinnos Foundation has since worked with Humane Society International to systematically collect all of the cats to treat, spay and neuter them. They have now reached nearly every one.
所以在2016年，监狱官员终于允许志愿者前来照顾这些猫。此后，一个名为猫咪基金会的智利组织与国际善待动物协会合作，将所有的猫集中起来进行治疗、阉割和绝育。现在几乎所有的猫都经过了处理

Quickly, men cradling cats in tattooed arms came bounding down stairs along the courtyard, handing animals through prison bars to the volunteers. In one stop, Denys Carmona Rojas, 57, a prisoner serving eight years on gun charges, doted on a litter of kittens in a box. He said he had helped raise many kittens in his cell, recounting one case in which he fed special milk to a litter after the mother died during birth.
很快，手臂上有文身的男人抱着猫，走下院子边的楼梯，隔着栅栏将猫交给志愿者。在其中一个楼梯口，57岁的丹尼斯·卡莫纳·罗哈斯拿着装在盒子里的一窝小猫，因枪支指控获刑8年的罗哈斯对它们充满溺爱。他说，他在自己的牢房里帮助饲养过许多小猫，并说到在一只母猫生产时死了，他要给一窝小猫喂特制牛奶的事情。

Chinese regulators on Tuesday appeared to backpedal from a plan to reduce how much money people spend on online video games, after the proposal had tanked video gaming companies’ stocks and raised doubts about the government’s commitment to reviving China’s slowing economy.
周二，中国的监管机构似乎叫停了减少用户网游消费的计划，此前该计划曾导致游戏公司股价暴跌，并引发外界质疑政府对重振正在放缓的中国经济的承诺。

The wide-ranging draft rules, as first announced late last month, would have imposed spending limits on the video gaming platforms and prohibited minors from tipping video game livestreamers, a popular way for fans to support their favorite online influencers. 
这份内容广泛的草案于上月底首次公布，它将对游戏平台施加消费限制，禁止未成年人打赏游戏主播，这是粉丝支持他们喜欢的网红博主的一种流行方式。

The plan came as a surprise to the industry, and investors dumped tens of billions of dollars in stock in Chinese gaming companies.The sell-off came just as the government is trying to woo back domestic and foreign investors amid a sluggish economy and widespread concerns that Beijing is more preoccupied with tightening control over the economy and daily life than in promoting growth.
业内对该管理办法感到意外，投资者随后抛售了数百亿美元的中国游戏公司股票。抛售发生在中国政府努力吸引国内外投资者之际。目前中国经济陷入低迷，而且人们普遍担心的是，北京更专注于收紧对经济和日常生活的控制，而不是促进经济增长。

Regardless of what comes next, the win on Tuesday sealed Mr. Trump’s status as the party’s standard-bearer in the history books: Before Mr. Trump, the only Republicans who have ever won both the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary have been sitting presidents.
不管接下来选情如何，周二的胜选都确立了特朗普在共和党历史中的领军人地位：在他之前，凡是能在艾奥瓦州党内初选和新罕布什尔州初选中都获胜的共和党人均为在任总统。

For weeks, Donald J. Trump has romped through Iowa and New Hampshire without breaking a sweat, muscling out rivals for the Republican nomination and soaking up adoration from crowds convinced he will be the next president of the United States.Mr. Trump still won easily. The voters opposed to his bid didn’t outnumber the many Republicans clamoring to see him return to power. It’s a lesser-of-two-evils election.
数周来，特朗普在艾奥瓦州和新罕布什尔州横冲直撞，轻松击败了共和党的提名竞争对手，赢得了大量民众的崇拜，他们相信他将成为下一任美国总统。特朗普仍然轻松获胜。反对他竞选的选民人数并没有超过许多希望他重新掌权的共和党人。这是一场两害相权取其轻的选举。

Mr. Newhouse warned about reading too much into the New Hampshire results, pointing out that the state, and its independents, lean left.When voters are just going up and down on Trump, they’re thumbs down,The Biden campaign, for example, has been quick to respond to Mr. Trump’s assertions that Mr. Biden is too old to serve another term, producing their own clips of Mr. Trump’s verbal slips and other moments of confusion.
纽豪斯警告，不要过度解读新罕布什尔州的选举结果，他指出，该州及那里的独立人士立场偏左。如果选民们对特朗普的情绪时好时坏，他们就会反对他，比如对特朗普说拜登年纪太老不该连任的问题，拜登竞选团队迅速作出回应，制作了特朗普口误和其他犯糊涂时刻的剪辑片段。

In 2012, seven of the 10 highest-grossing movies were U.S.-made. At the time, U.S. movie attendance was in a slow, decades-long decline. DVD sales were sputtering. Streaming was in its infancy.Studios began to change the content of movies to appeal to Chinese ticket buyers. In: visual-effects-driven spectacles. Out: dialogue-heavy dramas and comedies.
2012年，排在中国票房前十名的电影中有七部是美国制作的。那时，美国国内的影院上座率已开始了一个持续几十年的缓慢下降趋势。DVD销量惨淡。流媒体还处于起步阶段。好莱坞的电影公司开始为吸引中国购票者改变电影内容：更多以视觉效果为主的壮观场面，更少以对话为主的戏剧和喜剧情节。

If you don’t want to get off your high horse to see what we like, then it’s natural that you will be washed-out,Hollywood movies can no longer bring novelty to Chinese audiences.
你如果想要中国大陆这块流量，又不是很想放下自己的身段去看大陆人到底喜欢什么，那被大陆淘汰是很自然的事情，好莱坞电影再也没有办法带给大陆的观众新鲜感了。

The looming showdown between President Biden and former President Donald J. Trump, assuming Nikki Haley cannot pull off a hail-mary surprise, goes beyond the binary liberal-conservative split of two political parties familiar to generations of Americans.
如果尼基·黑利不能在成功机会微乎其微的最后努力中赢得出人意料的结果，现任总统拜登与前总统特朗普之间日益逼近的最后决战将超越几代美国人所熟悉的自由与保守的两党二元分歧。

North Korea has enough fissile material, mostly highly enriched uranium, for about 50 to 60 nuclear warheads, He said he believed North Korean military planners would favor a surprise attack, which commanders carried out when they invaded the South in 1950, to “knock the Americans mentally off-balance, knock everybody off-balance.” the United States still “seeks dialogue” with the North “without preconditions and harbors no hostile intent.”
朝鲜拥有足够的裂变材料，主要是高浓缩铀，可以制造大约50到60枚核弹头。他说，他相信朝鲜的军事规划者会倾向于发动突然袭击，以此“让美国人在心理上猝不及防，让所有人都猝不及防”。1950年朝鲜入侵韩国时，指挥官们就是这样做的。美国仍在“不设先决条件、不怀敌对意图”的情况下“寻求与朝鲜对话”。

Granted, my argument that the risk of war is overblown may be wrong. A rule of thumb in following China is always to distrust people who assert with confidence what will happen. “A China expert is an oxymoron,” Winston Lord, a former ambassador to China, likes to say. In truth, there are legitimate reasons to fear what China might do.
当然，我的这种认为战争风险被夸大的观点也可能是错的。关注中国的一个经验法则是，始终不要相信那些自信地断言会发生什么的人。前驻华大使温斯屯·洛德喜欢说：“中国问题专家是个自相矛盾的概念。”事实上，对中国可能会有何举动的担忧并非杞人忧天。

Hefei’s industrial policies have been so successful in nurturing technology manufacturers that the country’s central government has embraced tenets of what is known as the Hefei model.Some localities and enterprises are still blindly launching and duplicating new energy vehicle projects — these require our great attention, and effective measures should be taken to solve them
合肥的产业政策在扶植技术制造商方面非常成功，以至于中国的中央政府将所谓“合肥模式”奉为信条。部分地方和企业还存在盲目上马、重复建设新能源汽车项目情况，这些都需要引起我们高度重视，要采取有力措施来加以解决

Mr. Yi, who graduated in June 2022 with a bachelor’s degree in management, had always been told that a college education came with certain benefits. He wouldn’t need to toil as his parents had, working as vegetable wholesalers. He could expect good pay and respect.If you want me to go serve others, I think that’s a bit too low, to be honest.A college degree isn’t the golden ticket it used to be. 
易先生于2022年6月毕业，获得了管理学学士学位。他一直听别人说，大学学位会带来一定的好处，他不需要像父母那样辛苦地做蔬菜批发商。他可以得到高薪和尊重。你让我去给别人当服务员，我觉得有点卑躬屈膝，说实话。大学文凭不再是像过去那样的敲门砖。

There has been plenty of hand-wringing in the West about the prospect of China displacing — or at least rivaling — the United States as the world’s leading superpower. But the evolving security crisis in the Red Sea makes clear that this remains a distant prospect.
对于中国取代美国——或者至少是与美国竞争——成为世界头号超级大国的前景，西方有很多人感到忧心忡忡。但红海不断演变的安全危机清楚地表明，这样的前景依然很遥远。

Some people with ulterior motives try to stir up trouble and profit from the chaos,These are not only ‘bears’ and ‘short sellers.’ These market doomsayers are trying to shake the international community’s investment confidence in China and trigger domestic financial turmoil in our country.
一些居心叵测者妄图兴风作浪、趁乱牟利，不仅有‘看空者’‘做空者’，还有‘唱空者’‘掏空者’，企图动摇国际社会对华投资信心，妄图引发我国内金融动荡

The baby bust that we all know about has gotten worse in a way that isn’t yet widely understood.What makes a baby bust so hard to fight is that its effects compound over the generations. Fewer births in one generation lead to fewer women in the next generation to give birth. 
我们都知道的婴儿出生率骤降以一种尚未被广泛理解的方式变得更糟。婴儿出生率下跌之所以难以对抗，是因为它的影响会随着世代加剧。一代人生育的减少会导致下一代生育的女性人数减少。

Last year, even as China’s economy was expected to benefit from pent-up consumer demand after the lifting of pandemic restrictions, the property market weighed on growth. Real estate accounts for roughly one-quarter of China’s economy.
去年，就在人们预计中国解除了新冠病毒限制措施后，经济会从被压抑的消费需求中受益时，房地产市场却拖累了经济增长。房地产业约占中国经济产出的25%。

Even without firing a nuclear weapon, China could mobilize or brandish its missiles, bombers and submarines to warn other countries against the risks of escalating into brinkmanship. Mr. Xi and President Biden have calmed rancor since last year.Such memories have entrenched views in Beijing that the United States is inclined to use “nuclear blackmail.”
即使不动用核武器，中国也能通过调动或挑衅性地挥舞导弹、轰炸机和潜水艇等武器来警告他国，把对峙升级为边缘政策是有风险的。自去年以来，习近平和美国总统拜登已让中美之间的敌意缓和下来, 这些记忆牢固确立了中国认为美国会倾向于使用“核讹诈”的看法。

A powerful strategic deterrent capability can force the enemy to pull back from rash action, subduing them without going to war, Whoever masters more advanced technologies, and develops strategic deterrent weapons that can leave others behind it in the dust, will have a powerful voice in times of peace and hold the initiative in times of war.
强大的战略威慑能力就是让敌人不敢轻易动手，实现‘不战而屈人之兵’，谁掌握更加先进的技术，研制出性能‘一骑绝尘’的战略威慑武器，谁就能在和平时期拥有话语权，在战争时期掌握主动权。

By last year, Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, was showing up in India with his palms pressed in namaste and a vermilion mark on his forehead, inaugurating the country’s first Apple stores.All told, more than 130 Fortune 500 companies are doing business in Tamil Nadu.
去年，苹果首席执行官蒂姆·库克出现在印度，出席该国首个苹果专卖店的开幕仪式，他双手合十行礼，额头点着红点。在财富500强公司中，共有超过130家在泰米尔纳德邦开展业务。

Inside one Apple supplier, blue-smocked workers in surgical masks walked past banks of white-aluminum-cladded machinery on paths marked by yellow arrows stuck on the floor. Low ceilings, long clear sightlines and placards exhorting good behavior in English and Tamil completed the effect.
在一家苹果供应商内部，穿着工作服、戴着外科口罩的工人走在地上粘贴有黄色箭头的通道上，路过由白色铝合金包裹的机器。低矮的天花板、能清楚看到远处的视野，以及用英语和泰米尔语制作的守则标语牌都营造出良好的效果。

Today, people from around the globe are streaming across the southern border, most of them just as eager to work. But rather than trying to elude U.S. authorities, the overwhelming majority of migrants seek out border agents, sometimes waiting hours or days in makeshift encampments, to surrender.Being hustled into a U.S. Border Patrol vehicle and taken to a processing facility is hardly a setback.
如今，来自全球各地的人涌向南部边境，其中大多数人对工作的渴望丝毫不减。但移民中的绝大多数并没有试图躲避美国当局，而会去找到边境人员，有时在临时搭建的营地里等待数小时或数天，以求自首。对他们而言，被塞进美国边境巡逻队的车辆，带往处理设施并不是挫折。

Migrants from Africa, Asia and South America are mortgaging their family land, selling their cars or borrowing money from loan sharks to embark on long, often treacherous journeys to reach the United States.And by and large, they are not wrong.
来自非洲、亚洲和南美洲的移民们抵押自家的土地、卖掉汽车或借高利贷，踏上漫长而又往往艰险的赴美旅程。总的来说，他们并没有错。

In the video, Ms. Kim also expressed her desire to “involve myself actively in South-North Korean relations,” raising fears that she was overstepping her role.As the scandal has raged, Ms. Kim has avoided public appearances for one and a half months.
在视频中，金建希还表达了自己对“积极参与韩朝关系”的渴望，引发了人们对她僭越总统夫人角色的担忧。随着丑闻迅速蔓延，金建希已有一个半月未公开露面。

Four mothers sat quietly in the nursing room around midnight, breastfeeding their newborn babies. As one mother nodded off, her eyelids heavy after giving birth less than two weeks earlier, a nurse came in and whisked her baby away. The exhausted new mom returned to her private room to sleep.Sleep is just one of the luxuries provided by South Korea’s postpartum care centers.In 2007, when Ms. Kim was pregnant with her first child, joriwons were not yet popular. 
午夜时分，四位母亲安静地坐在哺乳室里，给她们刚出生的婴儿喂奶。一位母亲不到两周前刚刚生下孩子，她眼皮沉重，打起了瞌睡。一名护士走进来，把她的孩子抱走。这位疲惫不堪的新妈妈回到自己的房间去睡觉。睡眠只是韩国产后护理中心提供的奢侈品之一。2007年，金松韵怀第一个孩子时，产后护理中心还没流行起来。

Throughout the hallways of St. Park, workers quietly collect dirty laundry and deliver food, including the requisite miyeok guk, or seaweed soup, a post-birth Korean staple.In the lactation room, beads of sweat run down the forehead of a lactation specialist who squeezes drops of breast milk out of nipples — not always gently — to help with production. A limber Pilates instructor offers tips on body alignment and recovery during classes on the roof.
在St. Park的走廊里，工人们静静地收集脏衣服和送餐，包括必备的海带汤，这是韩国人产后的常见餐食。在哺乳室里，一名哺乳专员的额头淌下汗珠，她帮助妈妈们从乳头中挤出母乳——动作并不总是轻柔。一位身段柔软的普拉提教练在屋顶上课，提供有关身体调整和恢复的建议。
