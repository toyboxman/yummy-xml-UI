I co-founded Facebook in college 20 years ago, but I left California and start-up culture behind long ago for public policy and economics. As we sat over scrambled eggs, chicken sausage and whole-wheat toast, I was struck by how many of the wealthiest and most powerful figures in Silicon Valley — including some I knew — were now loudly backing Mr. Trump.
20年前，我在大学期间与人共同创立了Facebook，但我很久以前就离开了加州和创业文化，转而投身公共政策和经济学。当我们坐在一起吃炒蛋、鸡肉香肠和全麦吐司时，我惊讶地发现硅谷有那么多最富有、最有权势的人物——包括一些我认识的人——现在都在大张旗鼓地支持特朗普。

Trump officials point to his talk of slapping tariffs of 100 percent or more on Chinese cars built in Mexico and shipped to the United States as an example of how he would crack down on China’s tariff evasion. But this tactic isn’t scalable: Tracking the pathway of the more than $400 billion in goods that China ships to the United States would be a nightmare.
特朗普的官员指出，他曾表示要对在墨西哥制造并运往美国的中国汽车征收100%或更高的关税，以此作为他将打击中国逃避关税的例子。但这种策略是不可扩展的：要追踪中国运往美国的价值4000多亿美元商品的路径将是一场噩梦。

A more effective way of reducing dependence on China would be to focus tariffs on high-tech goods, and to waive them only if a very high percentage of such a good is made with non-Chinese parts, regardless of where it was assembled. The Biden administration is examining different techniques, such as barring Chinese vehicles, especially E.V.s if the data they produce could be transmitted to Beijing, which the administration frames as a national security risk.
减少对中国依赖的更有效的方式是将关税集中在高科技产品上，只有当此类产品中有很高比例使用非中国零部件制造时，才免除关税，无论这些产品在哪里组装的。拜登政府正在研究不同的方法，比如禁止中国车辆，尤其是电动汽车，如果它们产生的数据可能被传输到北京，美国政府认为这是一种国家安全风险。

The electorate is faced with a choice, the story goes, between two models for masculinity. Toxic versus positive. In response to the vein-popping, furious, felon model of the right, the left is offering us a more morally upstanding and expansive “positive masculinity.”
说起来，选民们要在有毒的和正面的这两种男子气概模式之间做出选择。为了回应右派青筋暴起、火冒三丈、穷凶极恶的男性样版，左派向我们提供了一种道德上更高尚、更包容的“正面男子气概”。

It’s not an easy time to be an American multinational company that sells to or buys from China. As the governments of the United States and China butt heads, they’re pressuring companies to take sides.Farley is steering a middle course with regard to China. Farley’s latest tactic for keeping up with Chinese competition is setting up a new operation in the Los Angeles area to design electric vehicles that will be entirely new from the pavement up, built around those new batteries.People are hedging their bets.
在这个时候当一家向中国销售或从中国采购的美国跨国公司可不容易。随着美中两国政府针锋相对，它们也在逼迫企业选边站。法利在中国问题上正在采取中间路线。为了跟上中国竞争者的步伐，法利的最新策略是在洛杉矶地区建立一个设计彻底全新电动汽车的新机构，这些汽车将以新电池为基础。大家都在两面下注以对冲风险。

During the 20th century, life expectancy rose dramatically, spurred on by innovations like water sanitation and antibiotics. Some scientists have projected that this pace will hold as better treatments and preventions are discovered for cancer, heart disease and other common causes of death.The researchers found that instead of a higher percentage of people making it to 100 in the places they analyzed, the ages at which people are dying have been compressed into a narrower time frame.
20世纪，在用水卫生和抗生素等创新的推动下，预期寿命大幅上升。一些科学家预测，随着癌症、心脏病和其他常见死因的更好治疗及预防方法被发现，这一速度将保持下去。研究人员发现，在他们分析的地方，活到100岁的人的比例并没有提高，人们的死亡年龄被压缩到一个更窄的时间范围内。

Dr. Olshansky has long pushed against the idea that life expectancy will steadily climb forever. In a 1990 paper published in Science, he presented a theory that humans were already close to reaching the limit for average life expectancy.More than 30 years later, he said his new study offers hard data to back up his original hypothesis — a claim even those who have bet against him say has merit.
奥尔尚斯基长期以来一直反对预期寿命将永远稳步攀升的观点。在1990年发表在《科学》杂志上的论文中，他提出了一个理论，即人类已经接近平均预期寿命的极限。30多年后，他说他的新研究提供了确凿的数据来支持他最初的假设——即使是那些与他打赌的人也认为不无道理。

As the country’s second-largest online retailer, it is the shopping destination of choice for those who embrace so-called downgraded spending — a social-media fueled maxim of Chinese consumers’ penny-pinching ways.Rattled by a real estate crisis with no end in sight and a faltering labor market, Chinese consumers are spending less and saving more.
拼多多是中国第二大在线零售商，也是那些推崇所谓“降级消费”的人的首选购物目的地，那是社交媒体描述中国消费者节俭生活方式的说法。受看不到尽头的房地产危机和劳动力市场衰退的影响，中国的消费者们正在减少支出，增加储蓄。

After a series of half-measures that have failed to reinvigorate the economy, Beijing has finally signaled that it is ready to take more aggressive action, although it’s unclear how far it is willing to go.While this has kept Chinese factories humming, it has left the country and its global trading partners awash in excess goods. 
在一系列不彻底的行动计划未能提振经济之后，中国政府终于发出信号表示正准备采取更积极的行动，尽管目前尚不清楚政府愿意走多远。虽然这让中国的工厂保持运转，但也让中国及其全球贸易伙伴淹没在商品过剩之中。

In the mid-2010s, economists started citing something called the Amazon Effect, for the influence wielded by the dominant online retailer Amazon.com to drive down prices across the web and at brick-and-mortar stores. Almost all retailers, including Amazon, track each other’s prices and then adjust their own using so-called dynamic pricing, when prices move according to market conditions.
2010年代中期，经济学家们开始提出被称为“亚马逊效应”的现象，即占主导地位的网上零售商亚马逊有压低其他网上商店和实体店价格的影响力。包括亚马逊在内的几乎所有零售商都会跟踪彼此的价格，然后在价格根据市场情况变动时，用所谓的动态定价来调整自己的价格。

The job came with a chauffeur-driven car, secretaries, a spacious office and a mahogany desk with a mother-of-pearl nameplate. South Korea has never formally accepted the division of the Korean Peninsula, which was imposed by the United States and the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. (Neither has North Korea, for that matter.) To assert its claim, the South appoints its own governors for five provinces in the North.But for many others, in North and South alike, that dream has faded.
这份工作的待遇包括一辆配有司机的车、秘书、一间宽敞的办公室，还有一张红木办公桌，上面摆着珍珠母镶嵌的铭牌。韩国从未正式接受美国和苏联在二战结束时施行的朝鲜半岛分治。（朝鲜实际上也没有接受。）为了坚持自己的主张，韩国任命了自己在朝鲜五个道的知事。但对另一些人来说，无论是在北方还是南方，这个梦想都已淡去。

The younger generations live in so much affluence and they are so inured to tensions with North Korea they don’t realize that the peace they enjoy is not permanent.Analysts have pondered questions like who would take over North Korea, and what would happen to its nuclear arsenal, should Mr. Kim’s regime implode in a coup or some other unforeseen event. But reunification has become a hollow slogan.The Koreas have drifted apart politically, economically and even linguistically.
年轻一代的生活如此富足，他们对与朝鲜的紧张关系已经习以为常，意识不到他们享受的和平并不是永久的。分析人士们思考的是如果金正恩的政权在政变或其他不可预见的事件中发生内讧，谁将接管朝鲜，朝鲜的核武库又将何去何从之类的问题。而统一已成为一个空洞的口号。朝韩两国在政治、经济甚至语言上都渐行渐远。

She also recalled seeing images of people who lined up to donate their blood to those who were injured in the uprising.“It was like two unsolvable riddles imprinted on my mind: How can humans be so violent, and how can humans be so sublime?” she said. “When I write novels, I find myself always returning to the theme of what it means to be human.”
她还回忆起看到人们排队为在起义中受伤的人献血的画面。“这就像两个无法解开的谜语，印在我的脑海里：人类怎么会如此残暴，人类又怎么会如此崇高？”她说。“当我写小说时，我发现自己总是回到身为人类意味着什么的主题上来。”

The novelist Hernan Diaz praised Han’s “unique ear for the rumors of history,” adding that she can “access the traumas that have shaped and bruised entire generations, and she does so without ever turning her novels into mere didactical tools.” In “Greek Lessons,” a woman loses her ability to speak and tries to restore it by learning ancient Greek. Idra Novey, in a review for The Times, called the novel “a celebration of the ineffable trust to be found in sharing language.” So it’s a pleasant surprise and a bit of poetic justice to see a woman become the one to end Korea’s literature Nobel drought.
小说家赫尔南·迪亚兹称赞韩江“格外善于倾听历史的传闻”，并说，她可以“触及塑造和伤害了整整几代人的创伤，而且她从来没有把她的小说变成单纯的说教工具”。在《希腊语时间》中，一个女人失去了说话的能力，她试图通过学习古希腊语来恢复这种能力。伊德拉·诺维在为时报撰写的书评中称，这部小说“颂扬了可以在共享的语言中看到的那种难以形容的信任”。因此，看到一位女性成为结束韩国文学诺贝尔奖荒的人，这是一个惊喜，也是一种诗意的正义。

After Beijing announced it would provide its most aggressive policy support in years, many analysts took to assuming that only an economy teetering on cataclysm would’ve kicked policymakers into action,It’s a compelling narrative, but it’s wrong.The danger for China lies in a possible repeat of a stock market debacle it experienced in 2015.
在北京宣布将提供多年来最积极的政策支持后，许多分析师认为，只有在经济濒临灾难的情况下，政策制定者才会采取行动。这个说法很有说服力，但它是错误的。中国面临的危险在于，2015年经历的股市崩盘可能会重演。

The deposits would then be forfeited and become tariffs if China eventually makes the measures permanent. The ministry accused European brandy producers of hurting Chinese producers by dumping brandy at unfairly low prices in the Chinese market.European officials have dismissed the dumping accusation as unfounded, pointing out that brandy is often much more expensive in China than in Europe
如果中国最终将这些措施永久化，这些保证金将被没收，变成关税。商务部指责欧洲白兰地生产商以不公平的低价向中国市场倾销白兰地，损害了中国生产商的利益。欧洲官员称，中国的倾销指控毫无根据，并指出中国的白兰地价格往往比欧洲贵得多。

Many poorer Indians have seen little benefit from that growth, as the country still struggles to generate enough employment. But it has provided the government with much-needed cash to grease diplomatic wheels, while China’s economic struggles have forced it to somewhat reduce its regional largess.The newfound leverage is coming in handy for India. 
许多穷困的印度人并没有从这种增长中得到多少利益，因为印度在创造足够多的就业机会上仍面临困难。但这种增长为政府提供了推动其外交进程急需的资金，而中国在经济上面临困境，迫使它在一定程度上减少了对该地区的慷慨解囊。印度将新获得的影响力派上了用场。
