To find the dance circle in the bed-and-breakfast’s courtyard, drive north from the bedsheet factory converted into a crafts market, toward the vegan canteen urging diners to “walk barefoot in the soil and bathe in the sunshine.” If you see the unmanned craft beer bar where customers pay on the honor system, you’ve gone too far.Welcome to the Chinese mountain city of Dali, also sometimes known as Dalifornia, an oasis for China’s disaffected, drifting or just plain curious.要在这家民宿的院子里找到集体舞会，可以从改建成手工艺品市集的床单厂往北走，朝着素食食堂的方向行驶，这家食堂呼吁食客“赤脚走在泥土里，沐浴在阳光下”。如果你看到无人值守、顾客可以通过荣誉系统付款的精酿啤酒吧，那你就已经走过了。欢迎来到中国山城大理，它有时也被称为“大理福尼亚”，是中国特立独行、漂泊不定或纯粹好奇者的绿洲。

The city’s nickname is a homage to California, and the easy-living, tree-hugging, sun-soaked stereotypes it evokes. It is also a nod to the influx of tech employees who have flocked there since the rise of remote work during the pandemic, to code amid the picturesque surroundings, nestled between snow-capped, 10,000-foot peaks in southwest China, on the shores of glistening Erhai Lake.
这座城市的昵称致敬的是加州，也是对那里轻松自在、绿树成荫、阳光普照刻板印象的反映。同时，这也认可了一种趋势：自远程办公在疫情期间变得流行以来，大量科技行业从业者涌入了这座风景如画的城市，在中国西南部白雪皑皑、海拔三四千米的山峰之间，在波光粼粼的洱海之畔编程。

Charles, who ascended to the throne in September 2022, has generally been in good health. As a schoolboy, he suffered from recurring tonsillitis, but as an adult, he enjoyed vigorous sports like hiking, polo and skiing. The king made two highly successful state visits to Europe, addressing the German Parliament in serviceable German, and drawing excited crowds during a walkabout with President Emmanuel Macron of France.
查尔斯于2022年9月登上王位，健康状况一直很好。学生时代，他曾反复患扁桃体炎，但成年后，他喜欢徒步旅行、马球和滑雪等激烈运动。国王对欧洲进行了两次非常成功的国事访问，他用流利的德语向德国议会发表了讲话，并在与法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙一起散步时吸引了激动的人群。

Last year, he played host at Windsor Castle to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, after she signed a Northern Ireland trade agreement with Mr. Sunak. The timing drew criticism, since it appeared to give a royal imprimatur to the deal — in what some considered an improper intervention by the monarch in politics.
去年，在欧盟委员会主席乌苏拉·冯德莱恩与苏纳克签署北爱尔兰贸易协定后，查尔斯在温莎城堡接待了她。这个时机招致了批评，因为这似乎是在为该协议打上王室的印记——一些人认为这是君主对政治的不当干预。

If you look at the world in 2024 or on a 10-year time horizon, we look like an empire in decline, tested on every front by revisionist powers, trying to juggle a worldwide array of commitments that we made when our powers seemed unchallenged.
如果只看2024年或未来十年的世界，美国看起来像是一个衰落的帝国，在各条战线面临着修正主义大国的考验，同时试图尽力兼顾我们在国力似乎尚未受到挑战时在世界各地所做的一系列承诺。

Transport officials have deployed thousands of employees to shovel snow and defrost railways and roads. Police officers helped push cars trapped by the frozen roads. 
交通方面的官员已部署了数以千计员工铲雪、解冻铁轨和道路。警方帮助推动由于道路结冰被困的车辆。

In the depths of the pandemic, as global supply chains buckled and the cost of shipping a container to China soared nearly twentyfold, Marco Villarreal spied an opportunity. The stars are aligning for Mexico, American consumers stuck at home during the pandemic snapped up Chinese-made laptops, toys, Covid tests, athleisure, furniture and home exercise equipment.
在新冠病毒大流行最严重的时候，随着全球供应链的崩溃，将集装箱运往中国的成本飙升了近20倍，而马可·比利亚雷亚尔发现了一个机会。目前的情况对墨西哥有利,疫情期间，困在家里的美国消费者购买了大量中国制造的笔记本电脑、玩具、新冠病毒检测盒、运动休闲服装、家具，以及家庭健身器材。

It’s the 3-D version of juggling windows on a computer screen. As neat as that sounds, pinching floating screens doesn’t make working more efficient because you need to keep twisting your head to see them.I could tolerate juggling a notes app, a browser and the Microsoft Word app for no longer than 15 minutes before feeling nauseated.
这是在电脑屏幕上切换窗口的3D版。虽然听起来很有趣，但是捏住浮动屏幕操作并不能提高工作效率，因为你需要不断扭头才能看到它们。我可以忍受在笔记应用程序、浏览器和微软Word应用程序之间切换的时间不超过15分钟，然后就会觉得恶心。

Next I tried the headset in the kitchen, loading a pizza recipe in the web browser while I grabbed and measured ingredients. Moving around while looking through the camera, I became nauseated again and had to remove the headset. The Vision Pro is most comfortable to use while seated. Apple advises people to take breaks to reduce motion sickness.
接下来，我在厨房里试了试这个头戴设备，在网页浏览器里下载了一份披萨食谱，同时抓取并称量配料。四处走动，并且通过摄像头看东西的时候，我再次感到恶心，不得不摘下它。Vision Pro坐着使用时是最舒适的。苹果公司建议人们中间休息一下，从而减少晕眩。

Suspicion of foreign espionage, cursive messages in ancient Chinese, a sensitive microchip — and a suspect that could not be stopped at the border.Ravindar Patil, the assistant Mumbai police sub-inspector assigned to the case, was scratching his head for answers. The rings on the bird’s legs, including one that had a chip, were sent to the forensic sciences lab.
外国间谍嫌疑、古汉语草书信息、敏感的微型芯片——还有一个在边境无法拦截的嫌犯。被指派负责此案的孟买警方助理副督察拉文达尔·帕蒂尔正在绞尽脑汁寻找答案。鸟腿上的环，包括一个带有芯片的环，都被送到了法医科学实验室。

For a family that has cultivated its public image through thousands of appearances a year — ribbon-cuttings, ship launchings, gala benefits, investiture ceremonies, and so on — the sidelining of Charles may finally force the royals to rethink how they project themselves in a social-media age.The culture of royal philanthropy,has too often capitalized on the gaps left exposed in a broken welfare state.
对于这个靠着每年几千次的公开露面——剪彩、船舶下水、公益晚会、授勋仪式等——来建立公众形象的家庭来说，查尔斯暂停公开露面也许最终会迫使王室成员们重新思考如何在社交媒体时代展现自己。王室的慈善文化往往利用了破碎的福利国家体系所暴露出来的漏洞

Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Mr. Trump’s campaign, said the former president “respectfully disagrees” with the decision and would appeal it.Without complete immunity, a president of the United States would not be able to properly function.
特朗普竞选团队的发言人史蒂文·张（音）表示，这位前总统“恕难同意”这一决定，并将提出上诉。如果没有完全的豁免权，美国总统将无法正常履行职责。

Ms. Chao had since 2018 been the chair and chief executive of the Chao family’s Foremost Group, which operates a global fleet of bulk carrier ships. The vessels are used to transport commodities like iron ore and soybeans. The Chao family, led by Angela and Elaine Chao’s father, James S.C. Chao, stands out because of its deep political and commercial ties in both the United States and China. As Foremost Group’s chief executive, Ms. Chao emphasized orders for new, more environmentally sustainable vessels that can burn alternative fuels.
赵安吉自2018年起担任赵家拥有的福茂集团的董事长兼首席执行官，该集团运营着一支全球散货船船队，从事铁矿石和大豆等大宗商品的运输。以赵安吉和父亲赵锡成为首的赵氏家族因在美国和中国的深厚政商人脉而备受瞩目。作为福茂集团的首席执行官，赵安吉强调要订购更环保、更具可持续性、使用可替代燃料的新型船舶。

Although born in America, she never forgot her roots and throughout her life helped build bridges of understanding between East and West. Losing her at such a young age is something we never imagined, and our entire family is devastated with grief,
虽然在美国出生，但她从未忘记自己的根，她一生都在帮助东西方之间架起理解的桥梁，我们从未想过她会这样早早地离开我们，我们全家都深陷在悲痛之中

DCM Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, began investing in China’s start-ups in 1999. The move reaped such blockbuster returns that in 2021, DCM said it planned to “double down” on its strategy of investing in China, the United States and Japan.
硅谷的风险投资公司DCM Ventures于1999年开始投资中国的初创企业，并获得了巨大的回报，因此，该公司在2021年表示计划“加倍努力”，实施在中国、美国和日本的投资战略。

In Munich, world leaders were left hushed and hollow-eyed, their annual security conference suddenly transformed into a wake. Rarely has the death of a single man summoned such a cascade of grief, anger and demands for justice.
在慕尼黑，世界各国领导人沉默不语，视线空洞，他们的年度安全会议突然变成了守灵会。很少有一个人的死会引发如此强烈的悲伤、愤怒和伸张正义的要求。

While not dismissing the difficulties, friends and associates believe that Ms. Navalnaya, 47, has a shot at succeeding through what they call her combination of intelligence, poise, steely determination, resilience, pragmatism and star power.
虽然朋友和同事们并不否认困难的存在，但他们相信，现年47岁的纳瓦尔纳亚拥有智慧、稳重、坚定的决心、韧性、务实以及明星影响力等综合能力，会设法把事情做成。

Mr. Yeung, the tech worker, has visited Shenzhen twice in the past year. He likes to eat hot pot and play archery and basketball in a sports entertainment complex. He said the workers he encounters in Shenzhen are more pleasant.Service in Hong Kong is gruffer and more hasty, he said. Most of all, Ms. Snow said, Shenzhen offered something Hong Kong famously lacks: a slower pace.
科技行业从业者杨泽去年曾两次来深圳。他喜欢吃火锅，喜欢在体育娱乐中心射箭、打篮球。他说他在深圳遇到的工作人员都比较令人愉快。他说，香港的服务更加粗暴和仓促。斯诺·王说，最重要的是，深圳提供了众人皆知香港所缺乏的东西：较慢的节奏。

When a stage production of “The Shawshank Redemption” opened recently in China, it was cast entirely with Western actors speaking fluent Mandarin Chinese. But that may have been the least surprising part of the show.
最近，话剧《肖申克的救赎》在中国公演，演员全部由能说流利普通话的西方演员担任。不过，这或许是整个演出最不令人惊讶的地方。

Yet the production reflects how some artists are trying to navigate the changing landscape of both what is permissible and what is marketable in China. And its success shows the appetite that many Chinese still have for cultural exchange.
然而，这部作品反映了一些艺术家正试图驾驭不断变化的环境，探索什么是被允许的，什么是被市场接受的。该剧的成功也表明，许多中国人仍然对文化交流怀有浓厚兴趣。

Its exterior of white columns and curving arches — inset with panels tinted green and orange, the national colors of Ivory Coast — is a stylistic improvement from earlier projects on the continent, which critics have derided as drab concrete monoliths. The partnership between China and Ivory Coast, a major producer of rubber and cocoa, is emblematic of the way China has eagerly pursued ties with resource-rich African countries.
它的外观由白色圆柱和弧形拱门构成，镶嵌着科特迪瓦的国家色——绿色和橙色——的面板，与非洲大陆早期的项目相比，在风格造型上有所改进，那些早期场馆被评论家讥讽为单调乏味的混凝土巨石。科特迪瓦是橡胶和可可的主要生产国，它与中国的合作关系，是后者热切寻求与资源丰富的非洲国家建立联系的体现。

That afternoon, the family gathered for a feast of barbecued lamb skewers, crab legs and freshly shucked oysters. Ms. Zhang glanced at the light rain still falling outside, unusual for November in Florida.
那个下午，一家人一起享用了羊肉串、蟹腿和新鲜的生蚝。张女士瞥了一眼外面淅淅沥沥的小雨，这在11月的佛罗里达州并不常见。

For years, Chinese companies and their contractors have been slaughtering millions of donkeys across Africa, coveting gelatin from the animals’ hides that is processed into traditional medicines, popular sweets and beauty products in China.But a growing demand for the gelatin has decimated donkey populations at such alarming rates in African countries that governments are now moving to put a brake on the mostly unregulated trade.Yet donkeys only breed a foal every couple of years.
多年来，中国企业及其承包商一直在非洲屠杀数百万头驴，贪求从驴皮中提炼明胶，将其加工成传统药物、受欢迎的糖果和美容产品。然而，对明胶日益增长的需求使非洲国家的驴子数量以惊人的速度减少，以至于各国政府现在正着手制止这种基本上不受管制的贸易。然而驴每隔几年才会繁殖一头幼崽。

Some Chinese companies or local intermediaries buy and slaughter donkeys legally, but government officials have also dismantled clandestine slaughterhouses. Donkeys are highly resistant to harsh climate conditions and can carry heavy loads for a sustained period of time, making them a prized resource in some areas in Africa. Yet unlike other four-legged mammals, they are very slow to breed and efforts to raise donkey breeding to industrial levels, including in China, have shown limited success.
一些中国企业或当地中介收购和屠宰驴的行为是合法的，但政府官员也捣毁了一些秘密屠宰场。驴对恶劣的气候条件有很强的抵抗力，可以长时间驮运重物，因此在非洲的一些地区成为珍贵的资源。然而，与其他四条腿的哺乳动物不同，驴的繁殖速度非常缓慢，将驴的繁殖提高到工业化水平的努力成效有限，在中国也是如此。

In recent years, what was once a luxury product became increasingly mainstream as incomes have risen among China’s middle and upper classes. Vendors of traditional Chinese medicine and health food companies have marketed ejiao (pronounced UH-jee-ow in Mandarin) as having potential benefits for people with circulatory, gynecological or respiratory issues.
近年来，随着中国中产阶级和上层阶级收入的增加，这种曾经的奢侈品逐渐变得主流。传统中药销售商和保健食品公司都在推销阿胶，宣称它对循环系统、妇科或呼吸系统有问题的人具有潜在的益处。

In some countries where donkey skins are legal, they also have been used to smuggle protected items like elephant ivory, rhino horns or pangolin scales that are wrapped in the skins, according to an investigation by the Donkey Sanctuary.
根据“驴保护区”的调查，在一些驴皮贸易合法的国家，驴皮也用于走私受保护的物品，比如用它包裹象牙、犀牛角或穿山甲鳞片。

His time with them, enjoying both their tranquillity and these moments of youth-like joy, was juxtaposed against an alarming spate of anti-Asian violence that was happening on streets around the Bay Area to grandparents just like his. It was a dissonance that both angered Wang and magnified this time with his grandmothers. 
和她们在一起的时候，他喜欢她们的安静，也喜欢她们返老还童般的快乐时光，与此同时，湾区一带的街头发生了一连串令人担忧的反亚裔暴力事件，这些暴力事件发生在像她们一样的老人身上。这种不和谐令王湘圣感到愤怒，也令他更加重视与奶奶和外婆的相处。

The film, alternately cheeky and humanist, flits between two visual languages, what Wang called “the movie of their lives and the movie that they’re in.” Silly skits that the director constructs for them — arm wrestling, watching “Superbad” — sit alongside quotidian snippets of their inner lives. The film is also philosophical, as his grandmothers reflect on hard pasts and consider the realities of aging.
这部电影在两种视觉语言之间穿梭，时而放肆大胆，时而充满人文关怀，王湘圣称之为“关于她们生活的电影和她们置身其中的电影”。导演为她们设计的那些傻乎乎的活动——扳手腕，看电影《太坏了》(Superbad)——与反映她们内心生活的日常片段并置。影片也有一个哲理层面，他的奶奶和外婆在片中反思艰难的过去，思考衰老的现实。

The most powerful sentiment in the film, though, comes from his grandmothers’ attitudes in the face of loss and pain. “Life is short,” Yi said over the video call. “We can only focus on this life. I’m still so happy in such an old age, which is really unexpected. Whether happy or not, we have to live our life, so it’s better to be happy.”
然而，影片中最强烈的情感来自他的奶奶和外婆对失去和痛苦的态度。“人生苦短，”易扬辉在视频通话中说。“我们只能把握今生今世。我这么大年纪还这么开心，真是意外。开心也是一天，不开心也是一天，就选择开心度过吧。”

Seeing hungry children pass by prompted him to invent a vitamin drink, which he called Wahaha Oral Liquid. “It solved the problem of kids who didn’t want to eat and suffered from malnutrition,” he said in a BBC interview.Mr. Zong’s rags-to-riches story had made him prominent in China even before a public feud with his foreign business partner considerably raised his profile — and his wealth. But tensions erupted in 2007 when Danone accused Mr. Zong of running secret companies selling virtually identical products that siphoned off as much as $100 million from the joint venture.
看到饥肠辘辘的孩子们从身边经过，他发明了一种维生素饮料，命名为娃哈哈口服液。他在接受BBC采访时说：“它解决了孩子们不想吃饭和营养不良的问题。”宗庆后白手起家的故事让他在中国声名显赫，甚至在他与外国商业伙伴的公开不和大大提高了他的知名度和财富之前就是如此。但在2007年，达能指控宗庆后经营秘密公司，销售几乎完全相同的产品，从合资企业榨走了一亿美元的资金，双方的矛盾爆发了。

The breakup sent a frisson of fear through multinationals, particularly in sectors like car manufacturing, in which the Chinese government required joint ventures and limited foreign companies’ stakes to 50 percent.But it proved more an isolated episode than a bellwether, and in retrospect, a mere blemish in an otherwise halcyon era. In recent years, multinationals have encountered other, far more challenging obstacles.
拆分给跨国公司带来了恐慌，特别是在汽车制造等行业，中国政府要求成立合资企业，并将外国公司的股份限制在50%以下。但事实证明，与其说它是一个风向标，不如说它是一个孤立的事件。回想起来，它不过是一个美好时代的瑕疵。近年来，跨国公司遇到了其他更具挑战性的障碍。

Nestled in a dense forest, the Ukrainian military base appears abandoned and destroyed, its command center a burned-out husk, a casualty of a Russian missile barrage early in the war.Not far away, a discreet passageway descends to a subterranean bunker where teams of Ukrainian soldiers track Russian spy satellites and eavesdrop on conversations between Russian commanders.The underground bunker, built to replace the destroyed command center in the months after Russia’s invasion, is a secret nerve center of Ukraine’s military.
茂密森林中的乌克兰军事基地似乎被遗弃和摧毁了，它的指挥中心已被烧成废墟，那是战争初期俄罗斯导弹袭击的结果。不远处，一条隐蔽的通道通向一个地下掩体，乌克兰士兵在那里跟踪俄罗斯间谍卫星，窃听俄罗斯指挥官之间的对话。这个地下掩体是乌克兰军方的秘密神经中枢，在俄罗斯入侵后的几个月里，它取代了被摧毁的指挥中心。

Quality, however, has only recently begun to catch up with quantity, mainly because farmers have begun augmenting Vietnam’s longtime cultivation of cheaper, easy-to-grow robusta beans with a connoisseur’s favorite, arabica.
然而，直到最近，越南咖啡的质量才开始提高，这主要是因为，在越南长期种植的价格较低、易于种植的罗布斯塔咖啡豆之外，该国农民又开始引入行家最爱的阿拉比卡咖啡豆。

A major beneficiary has been the cafe scene in the country’s largest metropolis, Ho Chi Minh City (a.k.a. Saigon). Thanks to direct crop-to-shop supplies, the retail business of coffee is booming as increasing numbers of indie roasteries and specialty coffeehouses sprout up around the city’s French colonial opera house, amid the megamalls and boutiques of fashionable Dong Khoi Boulevard, and in the shadows of the high-rise towers in District 2.
最大的受益者是越南最大城市胡志明市（即西贡）的咖啡馆。由于“从作物到商店”的直接供应，咖啡零售业务正在蓬勃发展，在这座城市的法国殖民时期歌剧院周围、时尚的东桂大道的大型商场和精品店之间，还有第二区高楼大厦的阴影之下，越来越多独立烘焙店和特色咖啡馆如雨后春笋般出现。

After a second pass through the water — stored a few days beforehand in vast clay pots to allow impurities to sink to the bottom — the potent brew is then poured into highball glasses and mixed with condensed milk.
在第二次过水之后——为了让杂质沉入底部，水是提前几天储存在巨大陶罐里的——将浓烈的咖啡液倒入高脚杯中，与炼乳混合。

But recently, the Big Three found themselves outmaneuvered and missing their goals for electric vehicle sales at the same time that a crop of new affordable, electrified foreign cars appeared, ready to flood the global market.The biggest threat to the Big Three comes from a new crop of Chinese automakers, especially BYD, which specialize in producing plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles. 
但最近，三巨头发现自己落于人后，都没能实现电动车销售目标，与此同时，一批新的廉价外国电动车冒了出来，准备涌入全球市场。三巨头面临的最大威胁来自一批新的中国汽车制造商，尤其是专门生产插电式混合动力车和纯电动汽车的比亚迪。

That is, on the surface, a good thing. Electric cars need to get cheaper and more abundant if we are to have any hope of meeting our global climate goals. Ford and GM plotted an ambitious E.V. transition three years ago. But it didn’t take long for them to stumble. 
表面上看，这是件好事。如果我们想实现全球气候目标的话，就需要更多的电动车，而且要更便宜。福特和通用汽车曾在三年前制定了雄心勃勃的电动车转型计划。但没过多久，它们就遇到了困难。

In other words, if Americans’ appetite for trucks and S.U.V.s falters, then Ford and GM will be in real trouble.If they can make it across this bridge quickly, they will survive. But if their S.U.V. profits crumble before their E.V. business is ready, they will fall into the chasm and perish.
换而言之，如果美国人对卡车和SUV的兴趣减弱的话，福特和通用汽车将遇到真正的麻烦。如果它们能迅速跨越这个障碍，就能生存下来。但如果来自SUV的利润在它们准备好做电动车生意之前就崩溃的话，它们将掉进深渊而毙命。

But in the long term, Mr. Biden must be careful not to cordon off the American car market from the rest of the world, turning the United States into an automotive backwater of bloated, expensive, gas-guzzling vehicles.
但从长远来看，拜登必须小心行事，不要将美国汽车市场与世隔绝，将美国变成汽车工业落后，充斥着造价昂贵、耗油的大车型之地。

But if they’ve done it, we can do it too. It will take grit and good-faith effort. We should assume that Ford and General Motors will be competing with BYD and Geely for decades to come — and we should relish that fight.
但如果中国能做到，我们也能做到。这需要勇气和真诚的努力。我们应该假设福特和通用汽车将在未来几十年与比亚迪和吉利竞争，我们应该渴望这场战斗。

“The Army will shrink excess, largely unmanned ‘hollow’ force structure and build new formations equipped with new capabilities needed for large-scale combat operations,” the document said. “By bringing force structure and end strength into closer alignment, the Army will ensure its formations are filled at the appropriate level to maintain a high state of readiness.”
“陆军将缩减过剩的、基本无人的‘空心’部队结构，并建立配备大规模作战行动所需新能力的新编队，”该文件称。“通过使部队结构和最终兵力更紧密地结合起来，陆军将确保其编制在适当的水平上，以保持高度战备状态。”

Country Garden, China’s largest real estate developer as recently as 2022, said on Wednesday that a creditor had asked a Hong Kong court to liquidate its operations and pay off lenders, in the latest sign that China’s housing crisis continues unabated.Ever Credit’s petition, known as a winding up petition, is meant to force Country Garden to close its doors and sell its assets to make money it can use to pay back its creditors.Country Garden said it would fight the court petition “vigorously,”
周三，2022年还是中国最大房地产开发商的碧桂园表示，一名债权人已呈请香港法院清算其业务并偿还贷款，这是中国住房危机持续发展的最新迹象。永恒信贷的这种申请被称为清盘呈请，意在迫使碧桂园关闭并出售资产，以换取资金偿还债权人。碧桂园表示，它将“坚决”反对呈请

China also revised its counterespionage law last year to expand the definition of what could be construed as spying. It stipulated that sharing “documents, data, materials and objects” could be considered spying if the information had “a bearing on national security and interests."China has sought to educate its citizens about the national security risks present in the economy through a series of comics from China’s Ministry of State Security. The online series is based on actual espionage investigations, the ministry has said.
中国去年还修订了反间谍法，扩大了间谍活动的定义。按照反间谍法的规定，获取“关系国家安全和利益的文件、数据、资料、物品”可被视为间谍行为。中国还力图对公民进行有关经济中存在国家安全风险的教育，包括使用国家安全部制作的一个连环画系列。国安部称该在线系列以真实案例为基础。
