And while Mr. Putin said he had no interest in pursuing another arms race, which helped bankrupt the Soviet Union, the implication was that the United States and Russia, already in a constant state of confrontation, would return to the worst competition of the Cold War.“We are dealing with a state,” he said, referring to the United States, “whose ruling circles are taking openly hostile actions against us. So what?”
普京说他无意再次进行曾导致苏联破产的军备竞赛，但言下之意是，已经处于持续对抗状态的美国和俄罗斯可能回到冷战时期最严酷的竞争。“我们在面对这样一个国家，”他说，其中的国家指的是美国，“它的统治集团正在对我们采取公开的敌对行动。所以怎么办？”

With those comments, Mr. Putin underscored one of the distinctive and most unsettling aspects of the war in Ukraine.In his speech, Mr. Putin portrayed Russia as the aggrieved state rather than the aggressor.Mr. Putin may have sensed, however, that this was a particularly ripe time to test the depth of the West’s anxieties. 
通过这些言论，普京强调了乌克兰战争特有的、最令人不安的方面。普京在讲话中称俄罗斯是受害者，不是侵犯者。然而普京可能感觉到，现在正是检验西方焦虑程度的好时候

The K-pop star looked utterly drained. Her face scrubbed of makeup, Goo Hara, one of South Korea’s most popular musical artists, gazed into the camera during an Instagram livestream from a hotel room in Japan. In a fading voice, she read questions from fans watching from around the world.In halting English, she gave a plaintive answer: “My life is always so fighting.”
这位K-pop歌星看上去已经被掏空了。在日本的一间酒店客房里，韩国人气最高音乐艺人之一具荷拉卸下了脸上的妆容，直愣愣盯着Instagram直播的镜头。她用越来越虚弱的声音读着世界各地的粉丝发来的问题。她用不自然的英语给出一个令人神伤的回答：“我一辈子都在奋斗。”

The deaths have exposed a darker side to South Korea’s entertainment industry, a cultural juggernaut whose crushing demands often fall on the performers who fuel an insatiable assembly line of pop bands and streaming series.The industry represents an extreme version of a pressure-packed South Korean society pummeled by educational, economic and other stresses. The country has the highest suicide rate among the world’s wealthiest nations, with the gap especially stark for women.Not long after, Mr. Goo found his father passed out and foaming at the mouth after he had swallowed more than 20 sleeping pills. 
这些死亡暴露了韩国娱乐业阴暗的一面，这个庞大的文化产业常常令艺人不堪重负，他们需要满足流行团体和流媒体连续剧生产线永无穷尽的需求。在教育、经济及其它种种因素的冲击下，韩国社会承受着重压，而娱乐产业是一个极端的体现。这个国家有着全世界富有国家中最高的自杀率，而女性的自杀问题尤其严重。此后不久，具荷拉发现父亲在吞下了20多片安眠药后昏迷，口吐白沫。

After Kara disbanded, Ms. Goo released a solo album that did not sell well.Her detractors could be cruel. When she had plastic surgery on her eyelids and uploaded a photo, commenters mocked her.Mr. Choi posted pictures of his injuries on social media and sent a message to a celebrity news outlet, suggesting he had a salacious tip about Ms. Goo.Mr. Once the media learned of the video, the incident escalated into a full-blown frenzy. Choi told one news outlet that Ms. Goo had recorded the footage herself, and told another that she had an “explosive personality.”
Kara解散后，具荷拉发行了一张个人专辑，但销量不佳。批评她的人有时很残酷。她做双眼皮手术后上传了一张照片，结果遭到了评论者的嘲笑。崔钟范在社交媒体上发布了自己的伤痕照片，并给一家名人新闻媒体发了一条信息，暗示他手上有关于具荷拉的黑料。媒体得知这段视频后，事件引发了一场全面的狂热。崔钟范告诉一家新闻媒体，是具荷拉自己录制了这段视频，并对另一家媒体说她“性格火爆”。

Some have been redirected to smaller clinics. The government has temporarily allowed hospitals to let nurses fill in for doctors when appropriate. Nonetheless, many major hospitals remain short-staffed, generating complaints from the public.
一些人被转到较小的诊所。政府暂时允许医院在适当的时候让护士代替医生。尽管如此，许多大医院仍然人手不足，这引起了公众的不满。

They say the government has ignored structural issues that make some specializations like cosmetic surgery and dermatology more lucrative than vital services like emergency and pediatrics.
他们说，政府忽视了一些结构性问题，使得整形外科和皮肤科等专科比急诊和儿科等重要服务的收入更高。

The Commerce Department investigation announced on Thursday grew from a series of conversations that administration officials had with automakers last fall, after the settlement of a United Automobile Workers strike during which Mr. Biden stood with the union and joined a picket line. 
美国汽车工人联合会的罢工去年秋天得到了解决，拜登曾在罢工期间与工会站在一起，并加入了纠察线。

When Aleksei A. Navalny was alive, the Kremlin sought to portray him as an inconsequential figure unworthy of attention, even as the Russian authorities vilified and attacked him with a viciousness that suggested the opposite. the cause of death, according to preliminary medical information, was a detached blood clot.
在阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼还活着的时候，克里姆林宫试图把他描绘成一个不值得关注、无足轻重的人物，但俄罗斯政府对他狠毒的诋毁和攻击却说明事实恰恰相反。根据初步的医学信息，死因是血栓脱落。

Margarita Simonyan, head of the state news network RT, said on one talk show that the timing of the death raised “big questions” because Mr. Navalny’s wife was attending the annual Munich Security Conference at the time and made a statement “without her mascara even running.” What could be better for whipping up accusatory pathos than the sudden death of the main critic of the Kremlin, as the deceased was called in the European press?
国家新闻网RT的负责人玛加丽塔·西蒙尼扬在一档脱口秀节目中说，死亡的时机引发了“重大质疑”，因为纳瓦尔尼的妻子当时正在参加一年一度的慕尼黑安全会议，发表声明的时候“睫毛膏都没花”。有什么比欧洲媒体所谓的克里姆林宫的主要批评者突然去世，更能激起指责的情绪呢？

It was not until later that he learned about the mass layoffs that swept northeastern China in the 1990s, during the country’s shift from a planned economy toward a market-based one. The region had been China’s industrial heartland, but suddenly millions of laborers were left unemployed. Crime and poverty rose. Even today, the region, sometimes called China’s Rust Belt, has not fully recovered.
直到后来，他才对20世纪90年代席卷东北的大规模下岗有所了解，当时正值中国从计划经济转向市场经济。东北曾是中国的工业重地，但突然间数百万劳动大军失业了。犯罪和贫困随之上升。即使在今天，这个有时被称为中国“铁锈地带”的地区仍未完全恢复。

Cultural commentators have declared a “Dongbei Renaissance.” Many stories set in the northeast, including Mr. Shuang’s, feature a gritty aesthetic of hulking smokestacks, blinding snow and ambient despair. When Mr. Shuang started writing, he rarely saw that face of the region represented.
文化评论家们宣告“东北文艺复兴”。许多以东北为背景的故事，包括双雪涛的小说，都少不了巨大的烟囱、刺眼的白雪，以及环境中的绝望。在双雪涛刚开始写作的时候，他很少看到东北的这一面被描绘出来。

The economy is now in recession after barely growing for decades. The population continues to shrink, with births last year plunging to a nadir. The country’s politics appear frozen as one party holds a virtual lock on power no matter how scandal-tainted and unpopular it becomes. Take a look around. There are few signs of the societal discord you might expect in a place with trend lines like Japan’s, such as accumulating garbage, potholes or picket lines. The country remains remarkably stable and cohesive, with little sense of impending doom.
几十年来经济几乎没有增长，如今陷入衰退。人口继续萎缩，去年的出生率降至最低点。国家政治看起来一潭死水，因为一个政党无论多么丑闻缠身、不得人心，都能牢牢掌握政权。看看周围。在日本，虽然有种种这样的趋势，却几乎看不到社会不和谐的迹象，比如堆积的垃圾、坑洼不平的地面或随处拉起的警戒线。这个国家仍然保持着惊人的稳定和凝聚力，几乎没有末日来临的感觉。

It’s easy to see why people might be nonchalant. Unemployment is low, the trains run on time and the cherry blossoms bloom every spring. Tourists are flooding the shrines and shopping districts, and the stock market has hit a record high.That lulling sense of calm is heightened by an outside world plagued by wars and social challenges.Still, beneath Japan’s placid surface, plenty of entrenched problems remain. 
不难理解人们为什么如此淡定。失业率很低，火车准点运行，每年春天樱花盛开。游客们涌入神社和购物区，股市创下历史新高。外面的世界饱受战争和社会挑战的困扰，更加深了这种令人沉醉的平静感。然而，在平静的表面下，许多根深蒂固的问题依然存在。

Inconveniences like those, however, are more an irritation than a sign of imminent societal collapse. Japan’s decline is gradual, and in some ways barely perceptible, after the country rocketed to wealth in the decades following World War II. Even those who think Japan could use a shake-up are more resigned than radicalized.
然而，像这样的不便更多是一些烦心事，而非社会濒临崩溃的征兆。日本在第二次世界大战后的几十年里迅速达到富裕水平，其衰落是渐进的，在某些方面几乎难以察觉。即使是认为日本需要改革的人，也更多抱着顺其自然而非激进的态度。

The economy — now the world’s fourth largest, after dropping below Germany’s this month — dips up and down but has largely weathered a rate of national debt that is the highest in the world. Prime ministers may come and go, but they are replaceable emissaries of the status quo.
上个月，日本的经济排名下滑至德国之后，成为世界第四大经济体。它的经济起起伏伏，但基本上经受住了世界最高国债率的考验。首相可能来来去去，但他们只是维持现状的使者，是可以随意替换的。

Allegations began to emerge late last fall that several factions within the L.D.P. had failed to record the full amount of proceeds from ticket sales to political fund-raisers. In some cases, it appeared that members of Parliament were taking kickbacks from some of the sales, and prosecutors have indicted three lawmakers, accusing them of violations of the Political Funds Control Act.
去年秋末开始出现指控，称自民党内部的几个派系没有将政治筹款活动的门票销售收入全部入账。在某些情况下，国会议员似乎从部分收入中收取了回扣，检察官起诉了三名议员，指控他们违反了《政治资金规正法》

Yet unlike in other countries where politicians have been accused of extravagant acts of corruption, the Japanese media has dug up relatively tame evidence of campaign gifts and dinners. With the political opposition in disarray, the L.D.P. appears likely to survive another of its numerous own goals. One reason: Voters are just not very plugged in.
然而，与其他国家的政界人士被指控肆无忌惮的腐败不同，日本媒体挖出的竞选礼物和晚宴证据相对不起眼。在政治反对派一片混乱的情况下，自民党似乎可以再一次挺过它的众多自摆乌龙。选民的参与度不够是其中的一个原因。

It’s not that there is anything bad about your hair, the police officer politely explained to the young Black man as commuters streamed past in Tokyo Station. It’s just that, based on his experience, people with dreadlocks were more likely to possess drugs. I’m like as Japanese as it comes, just a bit tan, Not every Black person is going to have drugs.
不是说你的发型有什么不好，在东京站熙熙攘攘的人流中，警察礼貌地向这名年轻的黑人男子解释道。只是，根据他的经验，梳着脏辫的人更有可能持有毒品。我是个不折不扣的日本人，只是肤色更黑一点，不是每个黑人都有毒品。

As the economy expanded, the government used its prosperity to purchase the same tech that the United States has to keep watch over its citizens. But what Pei reveals is that souped-up gizmos are not what granted the state its more deeply invasive system of control. Instead, money poured into local and regional police forces, allowing them to beef up their considerable network of informants and spies. 
随着经济的扩张，政府利用其繁荣购买了与美国一样的技术，以监视自己的公民。但裴敏欣所揭示的是，国家之所以能够建立更具入侵性的控制系统，并不是因为有了更先进的小发明。相反，资金涌入了地方和地区警察部队，使他们能够加强庞大的线人和间谍网络。

Yet Mr. Biden is now four years older, and it may be impossible to completely reassure voters about his age given the inexorable march of time. The poll indicates that the worries about him are not only pernicious but also now intertwined with how many voters view him.
然而，拜登现在又老了四岁，鉴于时间的无情推移，可能难以让选民对他的年龄彻底放心。民意调查显示，对他的担忧不仅对他有害，而且现在还与很多选民对他的整体看法交织在一起。

“You’ve just kind of seen the clips of, you know, he’s having memories onstage and, you know, during debate and discussion where he kind of freezes up a lot,” said Mr. Nurjadin, who does data entry work. “Him being sharp and fit is not very convincing.” he was unconvinced by politicians in his party who have publicly played up their direct observations of Mr. Biden’s mental sharpness.
“你看到了一些片段，他在台上需要回忆，在辩论和讨论中，他经常有点僵住，”从事数据录入工作的努尔贾丁说。“（在这些片段中）他的敏锐和健康并不是很有说服力。”他不相信党内一些政界人士公开强调的他们对拜登思维敏捷程度的直接观察。
