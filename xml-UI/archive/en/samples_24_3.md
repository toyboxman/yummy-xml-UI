And while Mr. Putin said he had no interest in pursuing another arms race, which helped bankrupt the Soviet Union, the implication was that the United States and Russia, already in a constant state of confrontation, would return to the worst competition of the Cold War.“We are dealing with a state,” he said, referring to the United States, “whose ruling circles are taking openly hostile actions against us. So what?”
普京说他无意再次进行曾导致苏联破产的军备竞赛，但言下之意是，已经处于持续对抗状态的美国和俄罗斯可能回到冷战时期最严酷的竞争。“我们在面对这样一个国家，”他说，其中的国家指的是美国，“它的统治集团正在对我们采取公开的敌对行动。所以怎么办？”

With those comments, Mr. Putin underscored one of the distinctive and most unsettling aspects of the war in Ukraine.In his speech, Mr. Putin portrayed Russia as the aggrieved state rather than the aggressor.Mr. Putin may have sensed, however, that this was a particularly ripe time to test the depth of the West’s anxieties. 
通过这些言论，普京强调了乌克兰战争特有的、最令人不安的方面。普京在讲话中称俄罗斯是受害者，不是侵犯者。然而普京可能感觉到，现在正是检验西方焦虑程度的好时候

The K-pop star looked utterly drained. Her face scrubbed of makeup, Goo Hara, one of South Korea’s most popular musical artists, gazed into the camera during an Instagram livestream from a hotel room in Japan. In a fading voice, she read questions from fans watching from around the world.In halting English, she gave a plaintive answer: “My life is always so fighting.”
这位K-pop歌星看上去已经被掏空了。在日本的一间酒店客房里，韩国人气最高音乐艺人之一具荷拉卸下了脸上的妆容，直愣愣盯着Instagram直播的镜头。她用越来越虚弱的声音读着世界各地的粉丝发来的问题。她用不自然的英语给出一个令人神伤的回答：“我一辈子都在奋斗。”

The deaths have exposed a darker side to South Korea’s entertainment industry, a cultural juggernaut whose crushing demands often fall on the performers who fuel an insatiable assembly line of pop bands and streaming series.The industry represents an extreme version of a pressure-packed South Korean society pummeled by educational, economic and other stresses. The country has the highest suicide rate among the world’s wealthiest nations, with the gap especially stark for women.Not long after, Mr. Goo found his father passed out and foaming at the mouth after he had swallowed more than 20 sleeping pills. 
这些死亡暴露了韩国娱乐业阴暗的一面，这个庞大的文化产业常常令艺人不堪重负，他们需要满足流行团体和流媒体连续剧生产线永无穷尽的需求。在教育、经济及其它种种因素的冲击下，韩国社会承受着重压，而娱乐产业是一个极端的体现。这个国家有着全世界富有国家中最高的自杀率，而女性的自杀问题尤其严重。此后不久，具荷拉发现父亲在吞下了20多片安眠药后昏迷，口吐白沫。

After Kara disbanded, Ms. Goo released a solo album that did not sell well.Her detractors could be cruel. When she had plastic surgery on her eyelids and uploaded a photo, commenters mocked her.Mr. Choi posted pictures of his injuries on social media and sent a message to a celebrity news outlet, suggesting he had a salacious tip about Ms. Goo.Mr. Once the media learned of the video, the incident escalated into a full-blown frenzy. Choi told one news outlet that Ms. Goo had recorded the footage herself, and told another that she had an “explosive personality.”
Kara解散后，具荷拉发行了一张个人专辑，但销量不佳。批评她的人有时很残酷。她做双眼皮手术后上传了一张照片，结果遭到了评论者的嘲笑。崔钟范在社交媒体上发布了自己的伤痕照片，并给一家名人新闻媒体发了一条信息，暗示他手上有关于具荷拉的黑料。媒体得知这段视频后，事件引发了一场全面的狂热。崔钟范告诉一家新闻媒体，是具荷拉自己录制了这段视频，并对另一家媒体说她“性格火爆”。

Some have been redirected to smaller clinics. The government has temporarily allowed hospitals to let nurses fill in for doctors when appropriate. Nonetheless, many major hospitals remain short-staffed, generating complaints from the public.
一些人被转到较小的诊所。政府暂时允许医院在适当的时候让护士代替医生。尽管如此，许多大医院仍然人手不足，这引起了公众的不满。

They say the government has ignored structural issues that make some specializations like cosmetic surgery and dermatology more lucrative than vital services like emergency and pediatrics.
他们说，政府忽视了一些结构性问题，使得整形外科和皮肤科等专科比急诊和儿科等重要服务的收入更高。

The Commerce Department investigation announced on Thursday grew from a series of conversations that administration officials had with automakers last fall, after the settlement of a United Automobile Workers strike during which Mr. Biden stood with the union and joined a picket line. 
美国汽车工人联合会的罢工去年秋天得到了解决，拜登曾在罢工期间与工会站在一起，并加入了纠察线。

When Aleksei A. Navalny was alive, the Kremlin sought to portray him as an inconsequential figure unworthy of attention, even as the Russian authorities vilified and attacked him with a viciousness that suggested the opposite. the cause of death, according to preliminary medical information, was a detached blood clot.
在阿列克谢·纳瓦尔尼还活着的时候，克里姆林宫试图把他描绘成一个不值得关注、无足轻重的人物，但俄罗斯政府对他狠毒的诋毁和攻击却说明事实恰恰相反。根据初步的医学信息，死因是血栓脱落。

Margarita Simonyan, head of the state news network RT, said on one talk show that the timing of the death raised “big questions” because Mr. Navalny’s wife was attending the annual Munich Security Conference at the time and made a statement “without her mascara even running.” What could be better for whipping up accusatory pathos than the sudden death of the main critic of the Kremlin, as the deceased was called in the European press?
国家新闻网RT的负责人玛加丽塔·西蒙尼扬在一档脱口秀节目中说，死亡的时机引发了“重大质疑”，因为纳瓦尔尼的妻子当时正在参加一年一度的慕尼黑安全会议，发表声明的时候“睫毛膏都没花”。有什么比欧洲媒体所谓的克里姆林宫的主要批评者突然去世，更能激起指责的情绪呢？

It was not until later that he learned about the mass layoffs that swept northeastern China in the 1990s, during the country’s shift from a planned economy toward a market-based one. The region had been China’s industrial heartland, but suddenly millions of laborers were left unemployed. Crime and poverty rose. Even today, the region, sometimes called China’s Rust Belt, has not fully recovered.
直到后来，他才对20世纪90年代席卷东北的大规模下岗有所了解，当时正值中国从计划经济转向市场经济。东北曾是中国的工业重地，但突然间数百万劳动大军失业了。犯罪和贫困随之上升。即使在今天，这个有时被称为中国“铁锈地带”的地区仍未完全恢复。

Cultural commentators have declared a “Dongbei Renaissance.” Many stories set in the northeast, including Mr. Shuang’s, feature a gritty aesthetic of hulking smokestacks, blinding snow and ambient despair. When Mr. Shuang started writing, he rarely saw that face of the region represented.
文化评论家们宣告“东北文艺复兴”。许多以东北为背景的故事，包括双雪涛的小说，都少不了巨大的烟囱、刺眼的白雪，以及环境中的绝望。在双雪涛刚开始写作的时候，他很少看到东北的这一面被描绘出来。

The economy is now in recession after barely growing for decades. The population continues to shrink, with births last year plunging to a nadir. The country’s politics appear frozen as one party holds a virtual lock on power no matter how scandal-tainted and unpopular it becomes. Take a look around. There are few signs of the societal discord you might expect in a place with trend lines like Japan’s, such as accumulating garbage, potholes or picket lines. The country remains remarkably stable and cohesive, with little sense of impending doom.
几十年来经济几乎没有增长，如今陷入衰退。人口继续萎缩，去年的出生率降至最低点。国家政治看起来一潭死水，因为一个政党无论多么丑闻缠身、不得人心，都能牢牢掌握政权。看看周围。在日本，虽然有种种这样的趋势，却几乎看不到社会不和谐的迹象，比如堆积的垃圾、坑洼不平的地面或随处拉起的警戒线。这个国家仍然保持着惊人的稳定和凝聚力，几乎没有末日来临的感觉。

It’s easy to see why people might be nonchalant. Unemployment is low, the trains run on time and the cherry blossoms bloom every spring. Tourists are flooding the shrines and shopping districts, and the stock market has hit a record high.That lulling sense of calm is heightened by an outside world plagued by wars and social challenges.Still, beneath Japan’s placid surface, plenty of entrenched problems remain. 
不难理解人们为什么如此淡定。失业率很低，火车准点运行，每年春天樱花盛开。游客们涌入神社和购物区，股市创下历史新高。外面的世界饱受战争和社会挑战的困扰，更加深了这种令人沉醉的平静感。然而，在平静的表面下，许多根深蒂固的问题依然存在。

Inconveniences like those, however, are more an irritation than a sign of imminent societal collapse. Japan’s decline is gradual, and in some ways barely perceptible, after the country rocketed to wealth in the decades following World War II. Even those who think Japan could use a shake-up are more resigned than radicalized.
然而，像这样的不便更多是一些烦心事，而非社会濒临崩溃的征兆。日本在第二次世界大战后的几十年里迅速达到富裕水平，其衰落是渐进的，在某些方面几乎难以察觉。即使是认为日本需要改革的人，也更多抱着顺其自然而非激进的态度。

The economy — now the world’s fourth largest, after dropping below Germany’s this month — dips up and down but has largely weathered a rate of national debt that is the highest in the world. Prime ministers may come and go, but they are replaceable emissaries of the status quo.
上个月，日本的经济排名下滑至德国之后，成为世界第四大经济体。它的经济起起伏伏，但基本上经受住了世界最高国债率的考验。首相可能来来去去，但他们只是维持现状的使者，是可以随意替换的。

Allegations began to emerge late last fall that several factions within the L.D.P. had failed to record the full amount of proceeds from ticket sales to political fund-raisers. In some cases, it appeared that members of Parliament were taking kickbacks from some of the sales, and prosecutors have indicted three lawmakers, accusing them of violations of the Political Funds Control Act.
去年秋末开始出现指控，称自民党内部的几个派系没有将政治筹款活动的门票销售收入全部入账。在某些情况下，国会议员似乎从部分收入中收取了回扣，检察官起诉了三名议员，指控他们违反了《政治资金规正法》

Yet unlike in other countries where politicians have been accused of extravagant acts of corruption, the Japanese media has dug up relatively tame evidence of campaign gifts and dinners. With the political opposition in disarray, the L.D.P. appears likely to survive another of its numerous own goals. One reason: Voters are just not very plugged in.
然而，与其他国家的政界人士被指控肆无忌惮的腐败不同，日本媒体挖出的竞选礼物和晚宴证据相对不起眼。在政治反对派一片混乱的情况下，自民党似乎可以再一次挺过它的众多自摆乌龙。选民的参与度不够是其中的一个原因。

It’s not that there is anything bad about your hair, the police officer politely explained to the young Black man as commuters streamed past in Tokyo Station. It’s just that, based on his experience, people with dreadlocks were more likely to possess drugs. I’m like as Japanese as it comes, just a bit tan, Not every Black person is going to have drugs.
不是说你的发型有什么不好，在东京站熙熙攘攘的人流中，警察礼貌地向这名年轻的黑人男子解释道。只是，根据他的经验，梳着脏辫的人更有可能持有毒品。我是个不折不扣的日本人，只是肤色更黑一点，不是每个黑人都有毒品。

As the economy expanded, the government used its prosperity to purchase the same tech that the United States has to keep watch over its citizens. But what Pei reveals is that souped-up gizmos are not what granted the state its more deeply invasive system of control. Instead, money poured into local and regional police forces, allowing them to beef up their considerable network of informants and spies. 
随着经济的扩张，政府利用其繁荣购买了与美国一样的技术，以监视自己的公民。但裴敏欣所揭示的是，国家之所以能够建立更具入侵性的控制系统，并不是因为有了更先进的小发明。相反，资金涌入了地方和地区警察部队，使他们能够加强庞大的线人和间谍网络。

Yet Mr. Biden is now four years older, and it may be impossible to completely reassure voters about his age given the inexorable march of time. The poll indicates that the worries about him are not only pernicious but also now intertwined with how many voters view him.
然而，拜登现在又老了四岁，鉴于时间的无情推移，可能难以让选民对他的年龄彻底放心。民意调查显示，对他的担忧不仅对他有害，而且现在还与很多选民对他的整体看法交织在一起。

“You’ve just kind of seen the clips of, you know, he’s having memories onstage and, you know, during debate and discussion where he kind of freezes up a lot,” said Mr. Nurjadin, who does data entry work. “Him being sharp and fit is not very convincing.” he was unconvinced by politicians in his party who have publicly played up their direct observations of Mr. Biden’s mental sharpness.
“你看到了一些片段，他在台上需要回忆，在辩论和讨论中，他经常有点僵住，”从事数据录入工作的努尔贾丁说。“（在这些片段中）他的敏锐和健康并不是很有说服力。”他不相信党内一些政界人士公开强调的他们对拜登思维敏捷程度的直接观察。

The news conference with the premier was institutionalized in 1993 but didn’t become a must-watch TV event until Zhu Rongji, a sharp-tongued and good-humored premier, took the stage in 1998. Expressing his determination to be a good premier, he declared, “No matter if it’s a minefield or a bottomless abyss ahead, I will forge ahead without hesitation.”
1993年，总理记者会成为一项正式制度，但直到1998年，言辞犀利、幽默风趣的总理朱镕基上台后，它才真正成为大家必看的电视节目。他在表达自己成为一名优秀总理的决心时宣称：“不管前面是地雷阵还是万丈深渊，我都将勇往直前，义无反顾，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”

At 9 a.m., as a light sleet fell outside, dozens of the delegates sat in neat rows onstage, against a backdrop of towering red curtains. In unison with the other delegates seated below them, they sang the national anthem. Above the stage, the auditorium’s sweeping balconies were filled with Chinese and foreign journalists positioning cameras, jotting down notes and peering through binoculars at the officials far below.
上午9点，外面下着小雨，数十名代表整齐地坐在台上，身后是高高的红色幕布。他们与坐在下面的代表齐声唱起国歌。在舞台上方，礼堂宽阔的楼座坐满了中外记者，他们架好摄像机，做着笔记，用双筒望远镜向下看着远处的官员们。

In the lobby of the Great Hall, those officials fielded carefully worded questions from state media outlets about topics such as how Chinese-made cars could be promoted overseas, and how the Chinese people had benefited from government investments in water conservancy infrastructure.
在人民大会堂的大厅里，这些官员回答了官方媒体提出的措辞谨慎的问题，话题包括如何在海外推广中国制造的汽车，以及中国人民如何从政府对水利基础设施的投资中受益。

While a wrecked plane was never found, about 20 pieces of debris believed to be from the plane were located along the coasts of the African mainland and on the islands of Madagascar, Mauritius, Réunion and Rodrigues. In summer 2015, investigators determined that a large object that washed up on the shore of Réunion, a French island in the Indian Ocean, was a flaperon that had come from a Boeing 777, making it likely that it was debris from Flight 370.Another piece of debris, a triangular piece of fiberglass composite and aluminum with the words “No Step” written on its side, was found in February 2016 on an uninhabited sandbank along the coast of Mozambique.
虽然一直没有找到失事飞机，但在非洲大陆海岸以及马达加斯加、毛里求斯、留尼汪岛和罗德里格斯群岛发现了大约20块据信来自该航班的残骸。2015年夏天，调查人员确定，冲上印度洋法属岛留尼汪岛海岸的一个大型物体，是来自波音777飞机的襟副翼，很可能是370航班的残骸。另一块残骸是2016年2月在莫桑比克海岸一个无人居住的沙洲上发现的，那是一块三角形的玻璃纤维复合材料和铝材，上面写着“No Step”（禁止踩踏）。

Temu, the international arm of the Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, is flooding Google with ads for absurdly inexpensive goods. With an initial public offering looming, the fast-fashion merchant Shein is inundating Instagram with ads for clothes and accessories at rock-bottom prices. Developers of China’s video streaming and gaming apps are dumping marketing dollars into Facebook, X and YouTube to entice potential users.
Temu是中国电商巨头拼多多的国际分支，在谷歌上投放了大量极其廉价的商品的广告。随着首次公开募股的临近，快时尚商家希音(Shein)在Instagram上大量发布低价服装和配饰的广告。中国的视频流媒体和游戏应用开发商正在向Facebook、X和YouTube投入大量营销资金，以吸引潜在用户。

Temu opened its U.S. site in September 2022. It sold things like a garlic press for $2 or a cotton swab dispenser for $1.50. Temu is now available in 50 countries.What companies like Temu have done is really just open a fire hose of money that it is pouring into ads
Temu于2022年9月在美国开设了工厂。它出售的产品包括2美元的压蒜器和1.5美元的棉签盒。Temu目前在50个国家销售商品。Temu这样的公司所做的实际上就是拧开了资金投入的水龙头，源源不断流向广告

The matchup that many Americans had hoped to avoid — the 2024 sequel of Biden vs. Trump — is now an inescapable reality. And it will be an eight-month slog, with two nominees who polls show are deeply unpopular and who are each determined to make the race about his opponent, leaving both bent on running exceedingly negative campaigns.
许多美国人原本希望避免的竞逐——2024年拜登对阵特朗普的续演——现在已成为不可避免的现实。这将是一个为期八个月的艰苦过程，民意调查显示，两名提名人都非常不受欢迎，而且他们都决心将这变成一场针对对手的选举，因此两人都会展开极为负面的竞选活动。

“I’m not the gift of all presidents,” Mr. Biden told donors at a fund-raiser last month, “but I’m sure in hell better than the last guy.” Mr. Trump, 77, has portrayed Mr. Biden, 81, as elderly, enfeebled and unable to perform the basic tasks of the presidency. “It’s the fascists and the communists that surround him — they’re making the calls,They’re calling the shots. He’s not calling the shots.”
“我在这么多总统里不算出类拔萃，”拜登在上个月的一次筹款活动中对捐助者说，“但我确信我比上一位总统强多了”。现年77岁的特朗普则称，现年81岁的拜登年老体弱，无法履行总统职位的基本任务。“是他周围的法西斯分子和共产主义者——他们在做决定，是他们在发号施令。不是他在发号施令。

The economy is also expected to play a critical role. Americans remain downbeat even if the economic mood has ticked upward. Mr. Biden’s own approval ratings have yet to benefit after rampant inflation in 2022 drove prices upward.Democrats are roiled by divisions over the Israel-Hamas war and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with more than 100,000 primary voters in Michigan voting for “uncommitted” in that swing state’s recent primary to protest Mr. Biden. 
预计经济也将发挥关键作用。即使经济形势有所好转，美国人的情绪仍然悲观。在2022年严重的通货膨胀推动物价上涨之后，拜登本人的支持率始终未见起色。民主党人被围绕以色列-哈马斯战争和加沙人道主义危机的分歧所困扰，在密歇根州这个摇摆州最近举行的初选中，超过10万名初选选民投了“不表态”，以此抗议拜登。

For Mr. Trump, the 2024 election will be his third in a row atop the Republican ticket. His standing as the party standard-bearer — both politically and on policy — is now undisputed, having transformed the party’s positions on free trade, spending, entitlement programs and international affairs. Mr. Trump has broadly lumped all of his mounting legal woes — which diverted more than $50 million from his political accounts to legal fees last year — as “election interference.” 
对特朗普来说，2024年的大选将是他连续第三次获得共和党总统候选人提名。他在政治和政策上的党内标杆人物地位已是无可争议，他改变了共和党在自由贸易、财政支出、福利计划和国际事务上的立场。特朗普将他日益加剧的法律困境——去年他的政治账户中挪用了5000多万美元用于律师费——笼统地归为“干预选举”。

Between a few flecks of coral in the Indian Ocean, a ribbon of highway more than a mile long swoops up from the blue. Since 2018, the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge has connected this archipelago’s hyper-dense capital, Malé, and the international airport — expanded by Chinese companies — one island to the east.The Maldives, a tiny tourism-dependent country of 500,000 people, barely registers as a blip alongside India and China, the world’s most populous nations. Yet every blip counts in the two giants’ competition for influence across South Asia, and that has set the Maldives on a zigzagging course between them.
在印度洋的几片珊瑚之间，一条超过两公里的高速公路从一片蓝色中突然出现。2018年以来，中国-马尔代夫友谊大桥将马尔代夫群岛人口稠密的首都马累与中国企业扩建的国际机场连接在一起。马尔代夫是一个依赖旅游业的小国，只有50万人口，与世界上人口最多的两个国家印度和中国相比，它只是地图上一个小点。然而，在这两个大国争夺南亚影响力的竞争中，每一个小点都很重要，这也让马尔代夫在两国之间摇摆不定。

And India, which has been clashing with China along their Himalayan border, wants to make sure that the Maldives, its island neighbor, doesn’t become too cozy with Beijing.But the great-power competition across the Maldives’ sky-blue lagoons has yet to reach a boil. Beyond money and geography, there is another important difference between India and China as competitors, one that was illustrated during the Maldives’ flare-up with India earlier this year.
而印度一直在喜马拉雅边界上与中国发生冲突，希望确保其岛屿邻国马尔代夫不会与北京过于亲近。但在马尔代夫天蓝色的潟湖边，大国之间的竞争尚未达到沸点。除了金钱和地理位置，作为竞争对手的印度和中国还有另一个重要的区别，今年早些时候马尔代夫与印度的紧张关系就说明了这一点。

Three junior ministers attacked India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, on social media after he had promoted his country’s own paradisal atoll, an even smaller and far less developed archipelago called Lakshadweep. These “India Out” Maldivians inferred a threat to their economy. In the much louder backlash, nationalistic Indians urged a boycott of the islands.
印度总理纳伦德拉·莫迪宣传印度自己的天堂环礁——一个更小、开发程度也远远不及马尔代夫的群岛，名为拉克沙群岛，随后，马尔代夫的三名低阶部长在社交媒体上攻击他，这些主张“印度滚出去”的马尔代夫人认为，这对他们的经济构成了威胁。这些言论在印度的民族主义群体中产生了更强烈的反弹，呼吁抵制马尔代夫。

On Feb. 22, the Xiang Yang Hong 03, officially a Chinese research vessel, pulled into Malé. The Maldives’ government said it was just a port call. But as with the Indian airport projects, the ship left an air of ambiguity about possible military uses in its wake.
2月22日，中国科考船向阳红03号驶入马累。马尔代夫政府表示这只是一次港口停靠。但与印度机场项目一样，这艘船的到来令人产生港口可能被用于军事的遐想。

But the indictment suggested that Mr. Ding had some help: Another Google employee swiped Mr. Ding’s identification card at a company office to help him conceal a trip to China, according to the indictment.The government offered few details about the life of Mr. Ding, who began working for Google in early 2019 and quit suddenly in January — after booking a one-way ticket to Beijing.
但起诉书显示，丁林葳得到了一些帮助。起诉书称，另一名谷歌员工在公司办公室刷了丁林葳的员工卡，帮他隐瞒了一次中国之行。丁林葳于2019年初开始为谷歌工作，今年1月突然辞职，在此之前，他购买了一张前往北京的单程机票。

President Biden delivered an energetic and impassioned speech that was as much a campaign kickoff as it was a State of the Union, leveraging what is expected to be one of his largest audiences of the year to make a forceful case that he was fit enough for another four years.Mr. Biden has rarely been called a bold orator. But he arrived on Capitol Hill on Thursday with the benefit of mercifully low expectations after unrelenting Republican attacks on his mental and physical fitness.
拜登总统发表了一篇充满活力和激情的演讲，既是国情咨文，也是他竞选活动的开场白，这应该会是他本年度听众最多的一次演讲，他利用这个机会，有力地证明自己的身体状况足以再任职四年。很少有人把拜登称为大胆的演说家，好在当他周四抵达国会山时，人们对他的期望值很低，这源于共和党人对他精神和身体状态的无情攻击。

The full draft of the law was only made public for the first time on Friday, as lawmakers began to review it. It targets five offenses: treason, insurrection, sabotage, external interference, and theft of state secrets and espionage.The Bar Association of Hong Kong had recommended that the law’s definition of sedition include the intention to incite violence and narrow the scope of the offense. However, the draft of the law did not include such language.
该法律的完整草案周五才首次公开，立法者已经开始审阅。它针对五种犯罪行为：叛国、叛乱、破坏活动、外部干涉、窃取国家机密和间谍活动。香港大律师公会曾建议，法律对煽动叛乱的定义应包括煽动暴力的意图，并缩小罪行的范围。但是，法律草案并未包含这样的措辞。

According to the newspaper, Mr. Spavor contends that China had singled him out because he had unwittingly given Mr. Kovrig information about North Korea that the diplomat then passed along to Canada’s intelligence agencies. They, in turn, shared it with Canada’s allies.
该报道称，斯帕弗认为，中国之所以针对他，是因为他无意中向康明凯提供了有关朝鲜的信息，康明凯随后将这些信息转交给了加拿大的情报机构。然后加拿大情报机构又将它们与盟友分享。

With China’s economy stumbling, the ramped-up spending on renewable energy, mainly solar, is a cornerstone of a big bet on emerging technologies. China’s leaders say that a “new trio” of industries — solar panels, electric cars and lithium batteries — has replaced an “old trio” of clothing, furniture and appliances.
中国的经济已陷入困境，增加对可再生能源（主要是太阳能）的投资是中国对新兴技术下大赌注的一个重要部分。中国领导人说，太阳能电池、电动汽车、锂电池为代表的“新三样”已取代了服装、家具、家电为代表的“老三样”。

China’s coal consumption has made it the world’s largest annual contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. But the country’s pioneering role in making solar panels less expensive has slowed the increase in emissions.By contrast, Europe has costly electricity, particularly after it stopped buying natural gas from Russia during the Ukraine war. Land used in Europe for solar farms is expensive.If the Chinese manufacturers had not brought down the cost of panels by more than 95 percent, we could not see so many installations across the world, Annual solar panel installations have nearly quadrupled worldwide since 2018.
中国的煤炭消耗使其成为世界上每年排放温室气体最多的国家。但中国在降低太阳能电池板成本上的先锋作用已放慢了温室气体排放量的增长。相比之下，欧洲的电力成本昂贵，尤其是俄乌战争爆发导致欧洲不再从俄罗斯购买天然气之后。欧洲用于建光伏发电厂的土地的价格昂贵。如果中国的制造商未曾把电池板的成本降低95%以上的话，我们不会在世界各地看到这么多的太阳能安装,自2018年以来，全球的太阳能电池板年安装量几乎翻了两番。

China produces practically all of the world’s equipment for making solar panels, and almost all of the supply of every component of solar panels, from wafers to special glass.There is know-how to it, and it’s all in China,That know-how used to be in the United States. While Europe is mulling whether to follow the United States’ example with its own subsidies and import restrictions on solar products
中国生产世界上几乎所有用于制造太阳能电池板的设备，供应几乎所有太阳能电池板所需的组件，从晶片到特种玻璃。这方面的专业技术都在中国，那些专业技术曾经在美国。虽然欧洲正在考虑是否效仿美国的做法，对太阳能产品实行补贴和进口限制

Akira Toriyama, one of Japan’s leading comics authors, whose manga and anime franchise “Dragon Ball” achieved worldwide success with its mix of comedic characters and rousing martial arts battles, died on March 1. He was 68. The statement said the cause was acute subdural hematoma, a condition in which blood collects between the skull and brain. His best-known work, “Dragon Ball,” follows a young boy named Son Goku who embarks on a journey to collect the seven magical orbs that summon a wish-granting dragon.A prolific manga artist, Mr. Toriyama did not necessarily have an appetite for the genre as a reader.
日本著名漫画家鸟山明于3月1日去世，终年68岁，他的漫画和动画系列《龙珠》以喜剧性的角色和精彩的武打获得了世界性的成功。声明说，死因是急性硬膜下血肿，这是一种血液聚集在头骨和大脑之间的病症。他最著名的作品《龙珠》讲述了一个名叫孙悟空的小男孩踏上了收集七颗神奇宝珠的旅程，集齐七颗宝珠可以召唤实现愿望的神龙。鸟山明是一位多产的漫画家，然而作为读者，他不一定喜欢这个类型的作品。

But unlike Bill Gates, who has deployed his fortune in an effort to improve health care across Africa, or Walmart’s Walton family, which has spurred change in the American education system, Mr. Musk’s philanthropy has been haphazard and largely self-serving — making him eligible for enormous tax breaks and helping his businesses.The really striking thing about Musk is the disjuncture between his outsized public persona, and his very, very minimal philanthropic presence
比尔·盖茨用自己的财富来改善整个非洲的医疗服务，沃尔玛背后的沃尔顿家族则推动了美国教育体系的变革。与他们不同的是，马斯克的慈善事业杂乱无章，主要是为了利己，让他有资格获得巨额税收减免，并帮助他的企业。马斯克真正引人注目的地方在于，他的公众形象让人难以忽视，而他在慈善事业上的影响力却微乎其微。

Two former SpaceX executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, recalled that Ad Astra was sometimes discussed as a perk for the children of executives, though it was understood to be near impossible for the offspring of rank-and-file employees to gain admission.
两名因担心遭到报复而不愿透露姓名的SpaceX前高管回忆说，以达星辰学校有时被认为是给高管子女的一项福利，而大家都明白，对于普通员工的子女来说，想获准进入几乎是不可能的。

Mr. Trump on Monday offered a rambling explanation for his reversal, saying that he did not want to alienate young voters or imbue Facebook, which he considers a mortal foe, with more power.Trump’s flip-flop on TikTok puts House Republicans in a very awkward position because it forces them to choose between supporting Trump or standing up to China
周一，特朗普对其态度转变给出了东拉西扯的解释，称他不想疏远年轻选民，不想赋予他眼中的死敌Facebook更大权力。特朗普在TikTok上的立场变化让众议院共和党人陷入了非常尴尬的境地，因为这迫使他们在支持特朗普和对抗中国之间做出选择

If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a digitally altered picture of an absent British princess is apparently worth a million.That seemed to be the lesson after another day of internet-breaking rumors and conspiracy theories swirling around Catherine, Princess of Wales, who apologized on Monday for having doctored a photograph of herself with her three children that circulated on news sites and social media on Sunday.
如果说一图胜千言，那么一位久未露面的英国王妃的一张经过数字修改的照片显然胜过百万言。经过又一天的网络谣言和阴谋论肆虐后，这似乎是从中可以得到的教训，周一，凯瑟琳王妃为修改了一张她与三个孩子的合影照片而道歉，这张照片上周日在新闻网站和社交媒体上流传。

It was the first official photo of Catherine since before she underwent abdominal surgery two months ago — a cheerful Mother’s Day snapshot, taken by her husband, Prince William, at home. But if it was meant to douse weeks of speculation about Catherine’s well-being, it had precisely the opposite effect.
这是凯瑟琳自两个月前接受腹部手术以来公布的第一张官方照片，是一张欢快的母亲节抓拍，由她的丈夫威廉在家中拍摄。但如果这张照片是为了平息几周来人们对凯瑟琳健康状况的猜测，那么它的效果是适得其反的。

It adds up to a fresh tempest for a royal family that has lurched from one self-created crisis to another. Unlike previous episodes, this involves one of the family’s most popular members, a commoner-turned-future queen. Beyond the mockery, the royal family faces a lingering credibility gap. 
对于在一场又一场自己制造的危机中跌跌撞撞的王室来说，此事已经演变为一场全新的风暴。与之前不同的是，这一次涉及的是王室中最受欢迎的成员之一，一位平民出身的未来王后。除了嘲笑之外，王室还面临着挥之不去的信誉损失问题。

The discovery that the photo was altered prompted several international news agencies to issue advisories — including one from The Associated Press that was ominously called a “kill notification” — urging news organizations to remove the image from their websites and scrub it from any social media.
发现照片被修改后，几家国际新闻机构发出警告，其中美联社的警告使用了“封杀通知”这样不祥的字眼，敦促各新闻机构从其网站上删除该图片，并从任何社交媒体上将其删除。

Catherine’s embrace of social media to circulate her pictures is a way of reclaiming her life from the long lenses of the paparazzi. But the uproar over the Mother’s Day photo shows that this strategy comes with its own risks, not least that a family portrait has added to the very misinformation about her that it was calculated to counteract.
选择利用社交媒体传播自己的照片是凯瑟琳从狗仔队的长镜头中重新夺回自己生活的一种方式。但母亲节照片引起的轩然大波表明，这一策略也有其风险，尤其当一张本为了辟谣而发布的家庭照片反而增添了不实信息。

Boeing assembles the 737 Max at its plant in Renton, Wash., while Spirit builds the plane’s fuselage at its factory in Wichita, Kan.One audit dealt with the component that blew off the Alaska Airlines jet, known as a door plug. Boeing failed that check, according to the presentation.
波音公司在华盛顿州伦顿的工厂组装737 Max。势必锐公司则在其位于堪萨斯州威奇托的工厂制造飞机的机身。其中一项审计针对的是导致阿拉斯加航空公司那架飞机脱落的部件，即门塞。根据报告，波音公司未能通过这项检查。

When the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic in March 2020, nearly everything about the novel coronavirus was an open question: How was it spreading so quickly? How sick would it make people? Would a single bout buy you protection from future cases?
当世界卫生组织在2020年3月宣布Covid-19为全球大流行病时，关于这种新型冠状病毒的一切几乎都是个疑问：它为什么传播能力这么强？它会让人病到什么程度？感染一次后能为你带来保护，让你未来免受侵害吗？

Scientists have been trying to investigate if there’s something biologically unique about Covid superdodgers that gives them immunity to infection. But the closest they have come is finding that mutations in the human leukocyte antigen — which signals to the immune system that cells are infected — can help clear out the virus so quickly that a person might be completely asymptomatic.
科学家一直试图搞清楚新冠超级免疫者是否具有生物学上的独特性，使其获得了免疫。但他们迄今为止最接近的发现是，人类白细胞抗原的突变（向免疫系统发出细胞被感染的信号）可以帮助快速清除病毒，以至于一个人可能完全没有症状。

Trace back the digitally altered photograph of Catherine, Princess of Wales, and its roots lie in a tragedy of another Princess of Wales, Diana, whose death in 1997 predated the creation of Facebook by nearly seven years.
威尔士王妃凯瑟琳数码修改照片的根源可以追溯到另一位威尔士王妃戴安娜的悲剧，她于1997年去世，比Facebook的诞生早了近七年。

Diana’s fatal car accident, after a high-speed pursuit by photographers in Paris, left a lasting imprint on her sons, William and Harry. They grew up vowing not to take part in what they viewed as a pathological relationship between the royal family and the press, one in which they were the abused partners.
戴安娜在巴黎被摄影师高速追逐后发生致命车祸，给她的儿子威廉和哈里留下了永久的印记。在他们看来，王室和媒体之间存在病态的关系，他们是这种关系中受虐待的一方，他们从小就发誓绝不参与其中。

Outfitted in head-to-toe coveralls, with oversized safety glasses and hard hats, they’re reminiscent of the worker bees in the movie “Minions,” but color coded by function: Blue for maintenance. Green for vendors. Pink for janitors. White for operators.
他们从头到脚一身工装，戴着大大的护目镜和安全帽，让人想起电影《小黄人》中工蜂一般的角色，衣服颜色代表了不同的职能：蓝色是维护人员，绿色是供应商，粉色是清洁工，白色是操作人员。

The company manufactures high-end printed circuit boards and substrates, which serve as the foundation for advanced electronic components that power artificial intelligence and supercomputers.
该公司生产高端印制电路板和载板，是为人工智能和超级计算机提供动力的先进电子元件的基础。

A prominent Boeing whistle-blower, a former quality manager who raised concerns about manufacturing practices at the company’s 787 Dreamliner factory in South Carolina, was found dead on Saturday with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to local officials.Mr. Barnett told The Times in 2019 that he had discovered clusters of titanium slivers that were hanging over flight control wires in some planes. Those slivers were produced when fasteners were fitted into nuts.As a quality manager at Boeing, you’re the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public，Over the years, it’s just been a steady pecking away at quality” at Boeing
据当地官员称，波音公司的著名吹哨人——曾对该公司位于南卡罗来纳州的787梦想客机工厂的制造提出担忧的前质量管控经理——于周六被发现死于疑似自残的枪伤。巴内特在2019年告诉时报，他发现一些飞机的飞行控制线上悬挂着一堆堆的钛片。这些薄片是在紧固件装入螺母时产生的。作为波音公司的负责质量的经理，你是问题暴露在乘飞行出行公众之前的最后一道防线，多年来，波音的质量一直在一点点下降

Mr. Barnett’s mother, Vicky Stokes, said in an interview on Tuesday that her son’s experience with Boeing had taken a heavy toll, making him look older than his three brothers even though he was the youngest. “He just carried this on his shoulders for so many years,” she said.“I’m not going to set foot on an airplane today,” he said. “It’s sad. It breaks my heart. I love Boeing. I love what it used to stand for.”
巴内特的母亲维琪·斯托克斯周二接受采访时表示，她儿子在波音的经历对他造成了身心损害，尽管他是家里最小的孩子，但他看起来比三个哥哥还要老。“这么多年，他一直背负着这个负担，”她说。“我现在不会踏上飞机了，”他说。“这很可悲，让我很伤心。我爱波音。我喜欢它曾经代表的一切。”

Alex Haurek, a spokesman for TikTok, said in a statement that the House “process was secret and the bill was jammed through for one reason: It’s a ban.” This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States. The vote came down to something of a free-for-all, with unusual alliances in support of and opposed to the bill. Some legal experts have said that if the bill were to become law, it would probably face First Amendment scrutiny in the courts.
TikTok的发言人亚历克斯·豪雷克在一份声明中表示，众议院 “程序是保密的，法案被强行通过的原因只有一个：这是一项禁令。” 这项立法的结果是注定的：在美国全面禁止TikTok 投票可以归结为一场混战，支持和反对该法案者结成了不同寻常的联盟。一些法律专家表示，如果该法案成为法律，它可能会在法庭上面临第一修正案的审查。

Those algorithms, which guide how TikTok watches its users and feeds them more of what they want, are the magic sauce of an app that 170 million Americans now have on their phones. That’s half the country.Few expect those licenses to be issued — meaning that selling TikTok to an American owner without the underlying code might be like selling a Ferrari without its famed engine.And right now, China has no incentive to relent.
这些算法指导TikTok如何观察用户，并向他们提供更多他们想要的内容，堪称这款应用的法宝。目前1.7亿美国人在手机上安装了这款应用，相当于半个美国。几乎没有人认为政府会颁发相关许可——这意味着，如果把没有底层代码的TikTok卖给美国人，可能就像卖出一辆法拉利，却不附带这个品牌著名的引擎。而现在，中国没有放手的理由。

TikTok has tried to enshrine that arrangement into a formal agreement to resolve the government’s national security concerns. But that idea met resistance from senior Biden administration officials, starting with Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco, who felt it was not tight enough to resolve their concerns.
TikTok试图将这一安排纳入一份正式协议，以解决政府对国家安全的担忧。但这一想法遭到了拜登政府高级官员的抵制，首先是司法部副部长丽莎·摩纳哥，她认为这尚不足以化解他们的担忧。

And that’s my point. All of the social media platforms are information minefields, rife with deceptive content from state actors, corporations, paid influencers and others. Their algorithms fuel our worst impulses by highlighting content that promotes anger and outrage. They strip mine our data to make money.
这正是我要说的。所有的社交媒体平台都是信息雷区，充斥着来自国家行为者、企业、付费意见领袖，以及其他人的欺骗性内容。这些平台的算法通过突出煽动愤怒和骇人听闻的内容助长了我们最糟糕的冲动。这些平台为了赚钱疯狂地开采我们的数据。

Forcing TikTok to merge with another data-hungry social media platform won’t solve any of that. What will make a difference is establishing base-line privacy rules that prohibit companies from exploiting our data and that give us control over the algorithms used to manipulate us.
强迫TikTok与另一个觊觎用户数据的社交媒体平台合并，并不能解决任何问题。能起作用的是建立基本的隐私规则，禁止公司利用我们的数据谋利，赋予我们权利，用于控制操纵我们的算法。

In observing Mary’s final days at Hospice, Kerr found his calling. “I was disillusioned by the assembly-line nature of medicine,” Kerr told me. “This felt like a more humane and dignified model of care.” He quit cardiology to work full time at the bedsides of dying patients. Many of them described visions that drew from their lives and seemed to hold meaning, unlike hallucinations resulting from medication, or delusional, incoherent thinking, which can also occur at the end of life. 
通过观察玛丽在安宁疗护下的最后时光，科尔找到了自己的使命。“我对医学流水线的本质感到失望，”科尔告诉我。“（安宁疗护）感觉像是一种更人道、更有尊严的护理模式。”他放弃了心脏病学，全职在临终病人的床边工作。这些病人当中，许多人描述的幻象都来自他们自己的生活，似乎有意义，这与药物导致的幻觉或妄想，乃至不连贯思维是不同的——这些也可能在生命尽头出现。

The presidential vote in Russia, which began Friday and lasts through Sunday, features the trappings of a horse race but is more of a predetermined, Soviet-style referendum. In a sprawling, diverse country like Russia, the Kremlin can also use more traditional means. Regions dominated by ethnic strongmen, like the Caucasus, habitually report huge turnouts with Mr. Putin receiving 99 percent of the vote — even if relatively few people show up at polling stations.
俄罗斯总统选举从周五开始，一直持续到周日。这次选举有着一场赛马应有的排场，但其实更像是一场结果已定的苏联式公投。在俄罗斯这样一个庞大而多元化的国家，克里姆林宫也可以使用更传统的手段。像高加索这样由少数民族强人控制的地区，通常会报告说投票率很高——并且由普京获得99%的选票——即使投票站出现的人相对较少。

Pyotr, 41, a marketing specialist in Moscow, expressed pride that Mr. Putin could outwit and outlast Western adversaries. “Against the background of these under-presidents, the Macrons and so on,” he said, referring to President Emmanuel Macron of France, Mr. Putin “looks like such a celestial being.”
41岁的彼得是莫斯科的一名营销专家，他对普京能智胜西方对手、比他们在任时间更长感到自豪。“在那些跟班总统、马克龙之流的衬托下，”他说——他指的是法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙，普京“就像天仙一样”。

In a message to 787 jet operators that was sent late Thursday, Boeing said it was advising of a “known condition related to a loose/detached rocker switch cap” located on the seat back of the captain’s and first officer’s seats but did not say whether the switch covers had played a role in the incident on the Latam plane.
在周四晚些时候发给787飞机运营商的信息中，波音公司表示，就机长和副驾驶座椅靠背上的“翘板开关盖松动/脱落有关的一个已知情况”提供建议，但没有说明开关盖是否与拉塔姆航空公司的事故有关。

When Australia’s broad-stroke foreign interference laws were passed nearly six years ago amid rising concerns about covert government meddling in Western democracies, they were heralded as trailblazing by the United States and other countries. Blockbuster prosecutions revealing sophisticated tactics seemed to be just around the corner. In theory, the new laws were an effort to defend democracy against foreign influence. In practice, they have raised tough questions about when such intentions might drift into xenophobia or wasteful effort.
将近六年前，由于人们越来越担心政府秘密干预西方民主，澳大利亚出台了宽泛的外国干涉法，这些法律被美国等国家誉为开创性举措。当时揭露复杂策略的重磅起诉似乎指日可待。从理论上讲，新法律是为了捍卫民主免受外国影响。在实践中，它引发了一个棘手问题，即这种意图在哪些时候可能会演变为仇外，或是变得劳而无功。

Mr. Duong had a tendency to talk himself up. He bragged about the mundane, like his travels, and boasted of the ties he had built with officials in both Australia and China.Born and raised in Vietnam, he fled in 1979, one of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Chinese who left the country. After cobbling together a middle-class life in Australia, he often sought to portray himself as a man on the rise.This was all proof, the Australian government argued, that Mr. Duong had been co-opted by a section of China’s influence-peddling operation known as the United Front Work Department.
杨怡生有一些爱自吹自擂。他会显摆例如旅行这样的日常琐事，并吹嘘他与澳大利亚和中国官员的关系。他在越南出生和长大，1979年逃离越南，成为离开该国的数十万华人之一。在澳大利亚通过艰难打拼成为中产后，他经常试图将自己描绘成一个正在往高处走的人。澳大利亚政府认为，这一切都证明杨怡生已被中国一个名为统战部、旨在对外施加影响力的部门拉拢。

Yes, that would be a bitter pill for America to swallow: Denuclearization has been a guiding principle of U.S. policy toward North Korea for decades. But it is unrealistic to pretend that Pyongyang will surrender its nuclear weapons anytime soon. Disarmament can remain a long-term goal but is impossible if the two sides aren’t even talking.Mr. Biden’s Republican opponents might accuse him of appeasement by engaging with Mr. Kim, but that is precisely what Mr. Trump tried. 
是的，这对美国来说是一颗难以下咽的苦果：几十年来，无核化一直是美国对朝政策的指导原则。但是，假装平壤很快就会放弃核武器是不现实的。核裁军可以是一个长期目标，但如果双方连谈判都不谈，这是不可能实现的。拜登的共和党对手可能会指责他与金正恩接触是一种绥靖政策，但这正是特朗普尝试过的。

I have made numerous visits to both nations’ capitals and met with officials and policy shapers. The sense of deep mutual distrust is palpable. Many Chinese look down on neighboring North Korea as backward and are annoyed by its destabilizing behavior. Many North Koreans resent China’s success and resist its influence; Pyongyang could allow much more Chinese investment but doesn’t want to be indebted to Chinese capital. 
我曾多次访问两国首都，会见两国官员和政策制定者。两国之间深刻的相互不信任感是显而易见的。许多中国人看不起邻国朝鲜，认为它落后，并对其破坏稳定的行为感到恼火。许多朝鲜人憎恨中国的成功，抵制中国的影响；平壤可以允许更多的中国投资，但不想欠中国资本的债。

A Chinese business titan pleaded guilty on Monday to federal charges that he made more than $10,000 in straw donor contributions to political candidates. Mr. Qin asked others to contribute to political campaigns of his choosing, and he agreed to reimburse them, in 2021 and 2022, according to prosecutors. He had tried to bash open a locked door with an ax in the September episode, which came months after another attack in which he attempted to strangle her, prosecutors said.
一位中国商业巨头周一对联邦指控表示认罪，即他向政治候选人提供了超过1万美元的稻草捐赠（以他人名义作为渠道，捐出超出辖区法律规定限额的竞选捐款——译注）据检察官称，覃辉于2021年和2022年让其他人为他选择的政治竞选活动捐款，实际则由他付款。检察官称，在9月的袭击事件中，覃辉曾试图用斧头砸开一扇锁着的门，而在此几个月前，他还曾在另一起袭击中试图勒死前妻。

His most beloved crooner sang a nationalistic ballad with an appeal to Russians: “The Motherland is calling. Don’t let her down.” His favorite band belted out a moody song about wartime sacrifice.
他最受喜爱的歌手唱了一首民族主义民谣，向俄罗斯人发出呼吁：“祖国在召唤。别让她失望。”他最喜欢的乐队高唱了一首忧伤的、关于战时牺牲的歌曲。

Mr. Putin, 71, showed little of the emotion he at times has displayed at similar events in the past, such as when he appeared to tear up during a victory speech after the 2012 election. He mouthed the words to the national anthem with relatively little enthusiasm and quickly left the event.
现年71岁的普京几乎没有表现出他在过去类似活动中时常表现出的情绪，例如2012年大选后，他在胜选演说中似乎流下了眼泪。他相对没有那么热情地对口型唱了国歌，然后很快就离开了活动现场。

As the bill was passed unanimously on Tuesday, lawmakers and officials called it a “historic moment.” Chris Tang, Hong Kong’s secretary for security, who oversaw the bill, likened its passage to the birth of his own son after multiple “miscarriages.” Lawmakers had put the legislation on the fast track, holding marathon sessions over a week and working through a weekend. The bill was passed unanimously on Tuesday.
这项立法在周二获得了一致通过，立法者和官员们称那是一个“历史性时刻”。负责这项立法的香港保安局局长邓炳强将草案的通过比作曾多次“难产”的亲儿子出世了。立法者们为这项立法开辟了快车道，一周里开了几次马拉松式会议，并在周末加班工作。草案于周二获得了一致通过。

He was also signaling robust American support for the Philippines at a high-water moment for recent relations between the countries. During his stop through a muggy Manila, Mr. Blinken toured the local branch of an Arizona-based semiconductor company, calling the Philippines “an increasingly critical partner” in that effort.
他还表示，随着菲律宾与美国近期关系抵达高点，美国将大力支持菲律宾。在闷热的马尼拉停留期间，布林肯参观了一家总部位于亚利桑那州的半导体公司在当地的分支机构，并称菲律宾是上述努力中“日益重要的合作伙伴”。

The nationalist newspaper Global Times reported that “Washington’s use of Manila as a proxy to disrupt the South China Sea situation could bring regional strategic confrontation to an unprecedented level,” and accompanied its story with an unflattering photo of Mr. Blinken grimacing and furrowing his brow.
《环球时报》报道称，“华盛顿利用马尼拉作为代理人来扰乱南海局势，可能会使地区战略对抗达到前所未有的程度”，并在报道中附上了一张布林肯面无表情、眉头紧皱的照片。

China Evergrande Group exaggerated its revenue by more than $78 billion and committed securities fraud over two years before its spectacular collapse in 2021, a top Chinese regulator said. In the company filing, Hengda laid blame solely on Mr. Hui. As chairman of Evergrande, Mr. Hui was in charge of all the company’s real estate business and “instructed other personnel to falsely increase the performance,” the company wrote. He did so, it added, “with exceptionally bad means and exceptionally serious circumstances.”
中国的最高监管机构称，在2021年崩盘前，中国恒大集团两年来虚增收入5641.46亿元，并涉嫌犯下债券欺诈行为。在公司文件中，恒大将责任完全归咎于许家印。该公司写道，作为恒大董事长，许家印负责公司所有房地产业务，并“授意其他人员虚增恒大地产年报业绩”。声明补充说，他这样做“手段特别恶劣，情节特别严重”。

The development is yet another blow to Evergrande’s already shattered reputation. Once an emblem of China’s entrepreneurial success and ambition, Evergrande is now a name that angers homeowners across China.
事态发展对恒大本已破碎的声誉来说是又一次打击。恒大曾经是中国创业成功和雄心的象征，如今却成为了令中国各地房主愤怒的名字。

Once one of Asia’s most high-flying cities, Hong Kong is now grappling with a deep pessimism.The stock market is in the tank, home values have tumbled and emigration is fueling a brain drain. Some of the hottest restaurants, spas and shopping malls that local residents are flocking to are across the border, in the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen.
香港曾是亚洲最繁华的城市之一，如今却陷入了深深的悲观情绪之中。股市低迷，房价暴跌，移民加剧了人才流失。当地居民趋之若鹜的一些大热餐馆、水疗中心和购物中心位于边境另一边的中国内地城市深圳。

The malaise hanging over Hong Kong is partly a consequence of its status as a bridge between China and the West, with the city’s growth dragged down by the mainland’s sputtering economy and China’s tensions with the United States.
萎靡情绪之所以笼罩香港，部分原因与这座城市作为中国与西方之间桥梁的地位有关，如今香港的经济增长受到内地经济衰退以及中美紧张关系的拖累。

Mr. Messi later posted a video clip on social media denying the allegations and professing his affection for China, footage that some internet users said looked akin to a hostage video.The controversy around Mr. Messi was a prominent example of an increasingly prickly official atmosphere — but it was far from the exception.The energy and unbridled optimism that was once Hong Kong’s most salient characteristic, its greatest asset, has been sapped
梅西后来在社交媒体上发布了一段视频，否认了这些指控，并表达了他对中国的喜爱。一些互联网用户说，这段视频看起来像是被强迫拍的一般。围绕梅西的争议是官方气氛日益敏感的一个突出例子，但这绝非特例。活力和无拘无束的乐观精神曾经是香港最显著的特征与最大的资产，如今已被渐渐消耗。

The Article 23 legislation is meant to root out such “soft resistance,” officials have said, as well as fill in gaps left by the national security law that China directly imposed. The laws center on five areas: treason, insurrection, sabotage, external interference and the theft of state secrets and espionage.
官员们表示，第23条立法旨在根除这种“软对抗”，并填补中国直接实施的国家安全法留下的空白。这些法律主要针对五个方面：叛国、叛乱、破坏活动、外部干涉、窃取国家机密和间谍活动。

To make matters worse, interest rates have soared in Hong Kong, roughly in line with those in the United States. That is because the city’s currency is tightly pegged to the dollar and fully convertible into dollars — a monetary policy that is central to the city’s role as a global financial center. But high interest rates have hurt the city’s huge real estate sector.
雪上加霜的是，香港利率飙升，与美国的利率大致持平。 这是因为港币与美元挂钩，并且与美元是联系汇率制度——这一货币政策对于香港作为全球金融中心的角色至关重要，但高利率损害了香港庞大的房地产行业。

Recently, he organized Hong Kong March, a monthlong cultural festival featuring film screenings, calligraphy classes and fairs in various cities in England. He is the founder of Hong Kong Umbrella Community, a nonprofit focused on the Hong Kong diaspora.
最近，他在英国多个城市组织了为期一个月的“香港三月文化节”，期间有电影放映、书法课程和集市等活动。他是“香港协会”的创始人，这是一个专注于香港侨民的非营利组织。

The friend then got into a kayak and paddled toward the Tesla, as another friend got into the water, swam to the vehicle and climbed on top of it, trying to find Ms. Chao, the report states. Her body was taken ashore, but emergency medical workers were not able to regain a pulse
报告称，这名友人随后跳上皮划艇，划向特斯拉，而另一名友人则跳入水中，游到车边，爬上车顶，试图找到赵安吉。她的尸体被打捞上岸，但急救人员无法恢复她的脉搏。

Benioff and Weiss dipped in and were intrigued by what they found: a sweeping space invasion saga that begins in 1960s China, amid the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, and involves a superior alien race that has built a rabid cultlike following on Earth. A heady mix of science and skulduggery, featuring investigations both scientific and criminal, it felt utterly unique. “So much content right now feels like, ‘Oh, here’s another forensic show, here’s another legal thriller,’ it just feels like it’s a version of something you’ve seen,” Benioff said. “This universe is a different one.”
贝尼奥夫和魏斯通读了小说，书中读到的东西激起了他们的兴趣：这部长篇小说讲的是太空人对地球发动全面入侵的故事，它始于20世纪60年代的中国文化大革命动乱期间，涉及一个能力更强的外星人种，他们在地球上发展了近乎狂热的极端信徒。小说将科学与阴谋诡计巧妙地结合起来，科学调查和刑事调查在其中占重要地位，令人耳目一新。“很多内容现在给人的感觉是，‘哦，它是又一个刑侦鉴识节目，它是又一部法律惊悚片’，让人觉得是曾经看过的东西的翻版，”贝尼奥夫说。“这部小说让人看到了一个完全不同的宇宙。”

Now, the difficulties are piling up. The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday for giving its own products advantages that it deprived rivals of having. The suit is the latest in a series of actions brought against the company by regulators on four continents.
现在，困难越来越多。周四，美国司法部对苹果提起反垄断诉讼，指控它为自己的产品提供了竞争对手无法获得的优势。这起诉讼是四大洲监管机构对该公司提起的一系列诉讼中的最新一起。

At first glance, his creations conform to traditional cutout designs of animals and auspicious symbols adorning doorways and windows in China. But a closer look at the shapes — birds, butterflies and blossoms perched on twisty vines — reveals bodies conjoined in the throes of intimacy or separated by brick walls.
乍一看，他的作品与装饰门窗的中国传统剪纸并无二致，都是动物和各种吉祥图案。但仔细观察这些小鸟、蝴蝶和在缠绕藤蔓上绽放的花朵，你就会发现，人体或在烈欲中结合，或被砖墙远远隔开。

Paper cutting is a folk tradition dating from the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220 C.E.) that involves cutting crisp lines and shapes into folded layers of rice paper. It’s about excising the negative space to reveal the picture inside.
剪纸是源自东汉时期（公元25-220年）的民间传统，在折叠的宣纸上剪出清晰的线条和形状。剪纸是把空白的地方剪掉，呈现出里面的画面。

Xiyadie’s home province of Shaanxi was a hub for folk art; in his hometown, paper cuts marked births, weddings and Lunar New Year celebrations. The women in the village passed on the craft to their daughters and daughters-in-law. Xiyadie said he learned it by observing his mother and village matriarchs. In “Hoping” (2000), one of the most poignant pieces depicting his family, his son rises from the confines of a wheelchair, sprouting wings, like a butterfly in metamorphosis.
西亚蝶的家乡陕西省是民间艺术的重镇；在那里，生子、婚嫁和庆祝春节都少不了剪纸。村里的妇女会把这门手艺传给女儿和儿媳。西亚蝶说，他是通过观察母亲和村里的年长女性学会这门手艺的。在《望》（2000年）这幅描绘他的家庭的最凄美的作品中，他的儿子离开轮椅的束缚站了起来，长出了翅膀，就像一只蜕变中的蝴蝶。

In previous years, the forum featured a lengthy, closed-door discussion with chief executives where the premier entertained many questions. But the premier’s conversation, usually on the event’s final day, was canceled this year without explanation, prompting some chief executives to skip Monday and schedule their private jets to fly out on Sunday evening.
在往年的论坛上，论坛的最后一天通常是总理与首席执行官们进行长时间的闭门讨论，回答他们提出的各种问题，但这种讨论今年却被取消了，而且没有做出任何解释，这导致一些首席执行官放弃周一的活动，在周日晚上搭乘私人飞机离开。

The election demonstrated a seemingly confident victory, And suddenly, against the backdrop of a confident victory, there’s this demonstrative humiliation.
总统选举显示出看似充满信心的胜利，突然间，在充满信心的胜利背景下，来了一场公开的羞辱。

After about half an hour, it was so smoky that Mr. Fidrya, 42, thought even the assailants must have left. As he ventured out, he saw the body of a dead woman lying by the escalator. Later he saw the body of another woman who had been killed in the carnage, her distraught husband standing over her. They then moved into the concert hall, where they sprayed gunfire as well, videos show.
大约半个小时后，重重浓烟让42岁的菲德里亚觉得就算是袭击者，肯定也都离开了。他试探着走出去，在自动扶梯边见到一个女人的尸体。后来他又见到一名在袭击中遇害的女性，她的丈夫站在一旁悲痛欲绝。视频显示，袭击者随后进入音乐厅，在那里也进行了扫射。

To be clear, there is nothing private about having cancer. A diagnosis requires referrals and a bewildering number of scans and tests. There are ultrasounds, MRIs, PET scans; colonoscopies, bronchoscopies, endoscopies. There are needle biopsies, razor biopsies, or liquid biopsies. Most of the tests require getting naked, or mostly naked, beneath a robe, sometimes waiting in a large room full of other terrified strangers also in robes, before presenting oneself to strangers who push, jab, thread and insert tools into or onto body parts that are not normally explored. Frequently, these tests have to be repeated, or different tests ordered, to rule something out.
说白了，患癌并不是什么隐私的事。确诊癌症需要转诊，还需要做大量的扫描和检查。有超声波检查、核磁共振成像、正电子扫描；结肠镜检查、支气管镜检查、内窥镜检查。有针刺活检、刮取活检或液体活检。大多数检查都需要病人赤身裸体或裸露大部分身体，只穿一件长袍，有时还需要在一个大房间里等待，那里挤满了同样穿着长袍、惶惶不安的陌生人，然后再接受陌生人对你的推动、戳刺、穿线，并将工具插入通常不会触碰到的身体部位。这些检查往往需要重复多次，或者要求进行不同的检查，以排除某些可能性。

Huawei’s innovation has made Apple’s latest models appear stodgy by comparison. And as China’s economy has struggled to rebound from the Covid pandemic, many consumers are hesitant to spend on what feels like an incremental upgrade. 
相比之下，华为的创新让苹果的最新款手机显得枯燥无味。由于中国经济在新冠疫情后的复苏步履艰难，许多消费者对是否要花钱对手机进行渐进式升级犹豫不决。

At one point in 1958, troops there hunkered in bunkers as Communist forces rained hundreds of thousands of shells on them. These days, the island, Kinmen, has become a hub of Taiwan’s commerce with China and its abandoned, weatherworn fortifications are tourist sites. 
1958年，共产党军队向该岛发射了成千上万枚炮弹，岛上的部队一度躲藏在掩体中。如今，金门岛已成为台湾与中国大陆通商的枢纽，这里饱经风霜的废弃防御工事也成为了旅游景点。

Incursions of Chinese fishing boats and smugglers around Kinmen have long been a source of friction. They came over here to fish with explosives, electric lines, gill nets, a lot of that kind of thing。
长期以来，中国渔船和走私者在金门附近的入侵一直是两岸摩擦的源头之一。他们来这边炸鱼、电鱼，用流刺网，这种东西很多

When the weather turned cold in December, Cindy Luo started to wear her fluffy pajamas over a hooded sweatshirt at the office. Wearing cozy sleepwear to work became a habit and soon she didn’t even bother to wear matching tops and bottoms, selecting whatever was most comfortable. The just-rolled-out-of-bed look was shockingly casual for most Chinese workplaces.
12月天气转冷时，辛迪·罗（音）开始在办公室里穿加绒睡衣，里面是连帽运动衫。穿着舒适的睡衣上班成了一种习惯，很快，她甚至懒得穿配套的上下装，只选择最舒服的。对大多数中国工作场所来说，这种好像刚从床上爬起来的装扮太过随意了。

The Foreign Office summoned China’s ambassador for a diplomatic dressing down. But there was no indication that the hackers made any effort to manipulate votes or change the registration data — raising the possibility that they were simply testing their ability to steal vast databases of information.
外交部召见了中国大使，进行了外交上的斥责。但没有迹象表明黑客试图操纵选票或更改注册数据——这让人怀疑他们只是在测试自己窃取大量信息数据库的能力。

Eager to start careers as filmmakers, Mr. Wang and some friends scraped together about $6,000, borrowed a camera and persuaded a company to give them film for free. His directorial debut, “The Days,” about a despondent artist couple, was screened at film festivals in Europe in 1994. The British Broadcasting Corporation listed it as one of the 100 best films of all time.
王小帅和一些朋友太想拍电影了，于是凑了5万块钱，借来一台摄影机，并说服一家公司免费提供胶片。他的导演处女作《冬春的日子》讲述了一对意志消沉的画家夫妇的故事，1994年在欧洲的电影节上放映。英国广播公司将其列入史上100部最佳电影。

In the core socialist values, the deepest, fundamental and most eternal is patriotism, Works imbued with patriotic sentiment are most effective in rallying the Chinese people to unity and struggle.
在社会主义核心价值观中，最深层、最根本、最永恒的是爱国主义，拥有家国情怀的作品，最能感召中华儿女团结奋斗。

China has had a front-row seat in witnessing Pakistan’s social, political, economic and security meltdown, What is happening in Pakistan, along with the situation in post-U.S. Afghanistan, represents a serious threat to Chinese interests in the broader South and Central Asian regions.
中国是巴基斯坦社会、政治、经济和安全崩溃的亲历者，巴基斯坦正在发生的一切，以及美国撤军后的阿富汗局势，对中国在更广泛的南亚和中亚地区的利益构成严重威胁。

But ship collision barriers are standard around the support piers of bridges over major waterways like the entrance to Baltimore’s harbor. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in New York City, for example, has massive barriers of concrete and rocks around the bases of the piers that support it. The ship in Baltimore was exiting the harbor as a spring tide was rushing out of the harbor. The moon was still almost completely full, having reached its fullest less than 24 hours earlier.
但在巴尔的摩港口入口等主要水道上的桥梁支撑桥墩周围，船舶碰撞屏障是标准设置。例如，纽约市的维拉扎诺海峡大桥在支撑桥墩底部周围设置了巨大的混凝土和石块屏障。巴尔的摩的这艘船驶离时正值大潮涌出港口。月亮几乎还是满月，在不到24小时前达到最圆。

Full moons in springtime are associated with some of the largest tidal changes in local sea level. The ebbing tide increases the speed of the water seaward, which effectively has a cumulative effect on the speed of an outbound vessel, and any currents in the water could also have complicated navigation
春天满月期间，在当地海平面会出现最大幅度的潮汐变化。退潮会增加海水向海方向的速度，这实际上会对出港船只的速度产生累积效应，而且任何水流都可能使航行变得复杂

The aliens who menace humankind in Netflix’s “3 Body Problem” believe in doing a lot with a little. Specifically, they can unfold a single proton into multiple higher dimensions, enabling them to print computer circuits with the surface area of a planet onto a particle smaller than a pinprick.
在网飞出品的《3体》（3 Body Problem）中，威胁人类的外星人相信“以小博大”。具体来说，他们可以将一个质子展开到多个更高的维度，从而在比针尖还小的粒子上打印出表面积相当于一个星球的计算机电路。

When Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas in Shanghai in 2020, he went off script and started dancing. Peeling off his jacket, he flung it across the stage in a partial striptease. Mr. Musk had reason to celebrate. A few years earlier, with Tesla on the brink of failure, he had bet on China, which offered cheap parts and capable workers — and which needed Tesla as an anchor to jump-start its fledgling electric vehicle industry. The Shanghai factory went up at lightning speed and without a local partner, a first for a foreign auto company in China.
当埃隆·马斯克2020年在上海发布首批中国制造的特斯拉电动车时，他脱离原定内容跳起舞来。舞台上，他挥舞着脱下的外套，做出了类似于脱衣舞的动作。马斯克有庆祝的理由。几年前，特斯拉濒临破产，他把赌注押在了中国身上，那里有廉价的零部件和能干的工人，而且中国需要特斯拉来锚定其刚刚起步的电动汽车产业。上海工厂以惊人的速度拔地而起，而且没有中国本土的合作伙伴，这在中国的外国车企中尚属首次。

And he got the emissions policy. Modeled after a California program that has been a boon for Tesla, the policy awards automakers credits for making clean cars. To lobby for the regulatory change, Tesla teamed up with California environmentalists, who were trying to clean up China’s soupy skies.
马斯克还得到了调整后的排放法规。这项政策仿效了加州一项为特斯拉带来福音的计划，它为汽车制造商生产清洁汽车提供信用额度。为了游说中国政府改变法规，特斯拉与试图净化中国被污染天空的加州环保人士进行了合作。

Chinese automakers like BYD and SAIC are pushing into Europe, threatening established carmakers like Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis. Detroit is also scrambling to keep pace. China could improve on it, he thought, yielding an efficient foreign factory that would serve as a “catfish,” an aggressive creature that makes other fish swim faster. China’s vision of Tesla being a catfish for local electric vehicle brands has proved prescient. Another supplier, LK Group, developed enormous casting machines that can make an entire section of a car with Tesla’s help. 
比亚迪和上汽等中国汽车制造商正大举进军欧洲，给大众、雷诺和斯特兰蒂斯等老牌汽车制造商带来威胁。底特律也在手忙脚乱地追赶。他认为，中国可以对此进行改进，建立一个高效的外国工厂，充当“鲶鱼”的角色，鲶鱼是一种攻击性生物，可以让其他鱼游得更快。中国让特斯拉成为本土电动汽车品牌鲶鱼的愿景，被证明是有先见之明的。另一家供应商力劲集团在特斯拉的帮助下开发了巨型压铸机，可以一次性制造汽车的一部分。

But China’s electric vehicle push has prompted anxiety in Europe. “When we decided to shift from thermic engines to E.V.s, we were late vis-à-vis China — I would say between five and seven years late,” said Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister. When Mr. Musk traveled to China last May, the battery maker’s chairman welcomed him with a 16-course banquet. 
但中国对电动汽车的推动在欧洲引发了焦虑。“当我们决定从热力发动机转向电动汽车时，我们已经比中国晚了——差不多晚了五到七年，”法国财政部长布鲁诺·勒梅尔表示。去年5月，当马斯克访问中国时，这家电池制造商的董事长为他举办了一个16道菜的宴会。

The Biden administration is growing increasingly concerned that a glut of heavily subsidized green technology exports from China is distorting global markets and plans to confront Chinese officials about the problem during an upcoming round of economic talks in Beijing.
拜登政府越来越担心，中国得到大量补贴的绿色技术出口已导致供过于求，正在扭曲全球市场，打算在北京即将举行的新一轮经济谈判中就这一问题与中国官员交锋。

Now, as the tech and economic cold war between the United States and China accelerates, Silicon Valley’s leaders are capitalizing on the strife with a lobbying push for their interests in another promising field of technology: artificial intelligence. On May 1, more than 100 tech chiefs and investors will come to Washington for a daylong conference and private dinner focused on drumming up more hawkishness toward China’s progress in A.I.
现在，随着美国和中国之间的科技和经济冷战加速，硅谷业界领袖们正在利用这场冲突进行游说，争取他们在人工智能方面的利益，这是另一个前景广阔的技术领域。100多名科技公司负责人和投资者将来到华盛顿，参加为期一天的会议和私人晚宴，活动重点是鼓励对中国在人工智能方面的进展采取更强硬的态度。

When people ask us whether it is OK for the United States to abandon Ukraine, the answer is no, because the world is operating not in a black-and-white way, or if you only look at one theater at a time, The world is interconnected.
当别人问我们美国可不可以抛弃乌克兰时，答案是否定的，因为世界不以非黑即白的方式运作，或是你一次只能关注一个战区，这世界紧密相连。

Other attacks are occurring on Earth. Russian hackers targeted a satellite system’s ground infrastructure in Ukraine, cutting off internet at the start of the war there. Attacks like jamming, which drowns out satellite signals, and spoofing, which sends misleading data, are increasing, diverting flights and confounding pilots far from battlefields.
地球上正在发生其他侵袭。俄罗斯黑客曾把一个卫星系统在乌克兰地面的基础设施作为打击目标，在俄乌战争爆发时切断了乌克兰的互联网。用干扰信号淹没卫星信号，假冒卫星发送信号等攻击正在增多，导致航班改道，使远离战场的飞行员困惑。

China retained and upgraded a World War II-era system, known as Loran, that uses radio towers to beam time signals across long distances. An enhanced version provides signals to the eastern and central parts of the country, extending offshore to Taiwan and parts of Japan. Construction is underway to expand the system west. The Chinese did what we in America said we would do，They are resolutely on a path to be independent of space.
中国保留并升级了第二次世界大战期间研发出来的“罗兰”(Loran)系统，该系统使用无线电发射塔来发送远距离时间信号。改进后的系统能为中国东部和中部地区提供时间信号，并把信号覆盖延伸到台湾沿海和日本部分地区。将该系统向西扩展的建设正在进行中。中国人做了我们美国人说我们要做的事情，他们正在坚定地走上不依赖太空的道路。

N.I.S.T. scientists say the signals are a thousand times stronger than those from GPS satellites, which orbit more than 12,000 miles above Earth. That makes them harder to jam or spoof. And because low-Earth-orbit satellites are smaller and more dispersed, they are less vulnerable than GPS satellites to an attack in space. space becomes an increasingly congested and contested domain. Other countermeasures look to the past. The U.S. Naval Academy resumed teaching sailors to navigate by the stars.
NIST的科学家说，来自这些卫星的信号比来自GPS卫星的强1000倍，GPS卫星的轨道位于地球表面上方约2万公里处。高强度信号使它们更难被干扰或被假冒。而且近地轨道卫星的体积更小、分布更广，因此与GPS卫星相比，它们更不容易受到太空攻击。太空已成为一个日益拥挤和充满争议的领域， 其他对抗手段着眼于历史。美国海军学院已恢复了教授水手如何用星星导航的课程。

A world without satellite signals is a world that is nearly blind. Ambulances will be delayed on perpetually congested roads. Cellphone calls will drop. Ships may get lost. Power outages may last longer. Food can cost more. Getting around will be much harder.
没有卫星信号的世界是个近乎失明的世界。持续堵车的道路会导致救护车延误。手机通话会中途断掉。船只可能会迷失航向。断电的时间可能会更长。食物可能会更贵。到各地旅行会更困难。
