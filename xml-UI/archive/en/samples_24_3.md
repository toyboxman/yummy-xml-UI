And while Mr. Putin said he had no interest in pursuing another arms race, which helped bankrupt the Soviet Union, the implication was that the United States and Russia, already in a constant state of confrontation, would return to the worst competition of the Cold War.“We are dealing with a state,” he said, referring to the United States, “whose ruling circles are taking openly hostile actions against us. So what?”
普京说他无意再次进行曾导致苏联破产的军备竞赛，但言下之意是，已经处于持续对抗状态的美国和俄罗斯可能回到冷战时期最严酷的竞争。“我们在面对这样一个国家，”他说，其中的国家指的是美国，“它的统治集团正在对我们采取公开的敌对行动。所以怎么办？”

With those comments, Mr. Putin underscored one of the distinctive and most unsettling aspects of the war in Ukraine.In his speech, Mr. Putin portrayed Russia as the aggrieved state rather than the aggressor.Mr. Putin may have sensed, however, that this was a particularly ripe time to test the depth of the West’s anxieties. 
通过这些言论，普京强调了乌克兰战争特有的、最令人不安的方面。普京在讲话中称俄罗斯是受害者，不是侵犯者。然而普京可能感觉到，现在正是检验西方焦虑程度的好时候

The K-pop star looked utterly drained. Her face scrubbed of makeup, Goo Hara, one of South Korea’s most popular musical artists, gazed into the camera during an Instagram livestream from a hotel room in Japan. In a fading voice, she read questions from fans watching from around the world.In halting English, she gave a plaintive answer: “My life is always so fighting.”
这位K-pop歌星看上去已经被掏空了。在日本的一间酒店客房里，韩国人气最高音乐艺人之一具荷拉卸下了脸上的妆容，直愣愣盯着Instagram直播的镜头。她用越来越虚弱的声音读着世界各地的粉丝发来的问题。她用不自然的英语给出一个令人神伤的回答：“我一辈子都在奋斗。”

The deaths have exposed a darker side to South Korea’s entertainment industry, a cultural juggernaut whose crushing demands often fall on the performers who fuel an insatiable assembly line of pop bands and streaming series.The industry represents an extreme version of a pressure-packed South Korean society pummeled by educational, economic and other stresses. The country has the highest suicide rate among the world’s wealthiest nations, with the gap especially stark for women.Not long after, Mr. Goo found his father passed out and foaming at the mouth after he had swallowed more than 20 sleeping pills. 
这些死亡暴露了韩国娱乐业阴暗的一面，这个庞大的文化产业常常令艺人不堪重负，他们需要满足流行团体和流媒体连续剧生产线永无穷尽的需求。在教育、经济及其它种种因素的冲击下，韩国社会承受着重压，而娱乐产业是一个极端的体现。这个国家有着全世界富有国家中最高的自杀率，而女性的自杀问题尤其严重。此后不久，具荷拉发现父亲在吞下了20多片安眠药后昏迷，口吐白沫。

After Kara disbanded, Ms. Goo released a solo album that did not sell well.Her detractors could be cruel. When she had plastic surgery on her eyelids and uploaded a photo, commenters mocked her.Mr. Choi posted pictures of his injuries on social media and sent a message to a celebrity news outlet, suggesting he had a salacious tip about Ms. Goo.Mr. Once the media learned of the video, the incident escalated into a full-blown frenzy. Choi told one news outlet that Ms. Goo had recorded the footage herself, and told another that she had an “explosive personality.”
Kara解散后，具荷拉发行了一张个人专辑，但销量不佳。批评她的人有时很残酷。她做双眼皮手术后上传了一张照片，结果遭到了评论者的嘲笑。崔钟范在社交媒体上发布了自己的伤痕照片，并给一家名人新闻媒体发了一条信息，暗示他手上有关于具荷拉的黑料。媒体得知这段视频后，事件引发了一场全面的狂热。崔钟范告诉一家新闻媒体，是具荷拉自己录制了这段视频，并对另一家媒体说她“性格火爆”。

Some have been redirected to smaller clinics. The government has temporarily allowed hospitals to let nurses fill in for doctors when appropriate. Nonetheless, many major hospitals remain short-staffed, generating complaints from the public.
一些人被转到较小的诊所。政府暂时允许医院在适当的时候让护士代替医生。尽管如此，许多大医院仍然人手不足，这引起了公众的不满。

They say the government has ignored structural issues that make some specializations like cosmetic surgery and dermatology more lucrative than vital services like emergency and pediatrics.
他们说，政府忽视了一些结构性问题，使得整形外科和皮肤科等专科比急诊和儿科等重要服务的收入更高。

The Commerce Department investigation announced on Thursday grew from a series of conversations that administration officials had with automakers last fall, after the settlement of a United Automobile Workers strike during which Mr. Biden stood with the union and joined a picket line. 
美国汽车工人联合会的罢工去年秋天得到了解决，拜登曾在罢工期间与工会站在一起，并加入了纠察线。
