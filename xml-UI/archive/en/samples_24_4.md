A worker currently at Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner factory in North Charleston, S.C., described seeing numerous problems on planes being assembled, including wires being routed incorrectly, raising the risk that they could rub against one another, resulting in damage. Boeing began to cut jobs and encouraged workers to take buyouts or retire early. It ultimately lost about 19,000 employees companywide — including some with decades of experience.
一名目前在南卡罗来纳州北查尔斯顿的波音787梦想飞机工厂工作的人称，他看到了组装飞机时的许多问题，包括电线的走线错误，这种错误会增加电线相互摩擦、导致损坏的风险。波音开始裁员，鼓励员工买断工龄或提前退休。全公司最终失去了约1.9万名员工，包括一些有几十年经验的员工。

“To single out Hong Kong and suggest that journalists would only experience concerns when operating here but not in other countries would be grossly biased, if not outrageous,” a government spokesman said in an emailed statement.
政府发言人在电子邮件声明中表示：“单单指责香港，并声称记者只有在香港工作时才会遇到麻烦，而在其他国家则不会，这种说法即使不是无理取闹，也是严重偏颇的。”

And when it comes to domestic politics, note the contrast. Trump made a big show of taking on China, but he was ineffective when in office and appears to have folded on TikTok when donor money was at stake. Biden talks more softly but is wielding a really big stick. Or to put it another way, Trump isn’t actually a tough guy on China; he just plays one on TV. Biden is the real deal.
当谈到国内政治时，请注意对比。特朗普大张旗鼓地展示了与中国的对抗，但他在任期间并未带来实际效果，而且在事关捐款时，他在TikTok这件事上似乎已经弃牌。拜登说话比较温和，但挥舞着一根大棒。或者换句话说，特朗普对中国其实并不是一个强硬的人，他只是在电视上表演强硬。拜登是来真的。

The court has made few specific details public, but Mr. Lin’s killing was, as a Chinese news outlet put it, “as bizarre as a Hollywood blockbuster.” Chinese media reports, citing sources in his company and court documents, have described a tale of deadly corporate ambition and rivalry with a macabre edge. Sidelined at work, Mr. Xu reportedly exacted vengeance with meticulous planning, including by testing poisons on small animals in a makeshift lab. (He not only killed Mr. Lin, but also poisoned his own replacement.)
虽然法院没有公开多少具体细节，但正如中国一家新闻媒体报道的那样，林奇被害一案“情节离奇堪比好莱坞大片”。中国媒体的报道引用林奇公司的消息来源和法庭文件，讲述了一个令人毛骨悚然的故事，其中充满致命的商业野心与竞争。据报道，许垚在公司被边缘化后精心策划了报复行动，包括在一个临时实验室里用小动物来测试毒药。（他不仅杀害了林奇，也给自己的继任者投了毒。）

Watching “Oppenheimer,” the Oscar-winning biopic about the father of the atomic bomb that opened in Japan on Friday, Kako Okuno was stunned by a scene in which scientists celebrated the explosion over Hiroshima with thunderous foot stomping and the waving of American flags. Ms. Okuno, who watched the film in Tokyo on Saturday, lamented that it did not reflect the experiences of the hundreds of thousands of atomic bomb victims in Hiroshima or Nagasaki.
周五，关于原子弹之父的奥斯卡获奖传记片《奥本海默》在日本上映，观影期间奥野佳子（音）被一场戏震惊了：科学家们用雷鸣般的跺脚和挥舞美国国旗来庆祝广岛上空的爆炸。奥野周六在东京观看了这部电影，她悲叹影片没有反映广岛或长崎数十万原子弹受害者的经历。

Eight months after Christopher Nolan’s film became a box office hit in the United States, “Oppenheimer” is now confronting Japanese audiences with the flip-side American perspective on the most scarring events of Japan’s history. The movie follows the breakthrough discoveries of J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team before the United States struck Japan with the first salvo of the nuclear age.
在美国票房大卖八个月后，克里斯托弗·诺兰的电影来到日本观众面前，将处在对立面的美国人眼中这起日本历史上最具创伤性的事件呈现给他们。影片讲述了J·罗伯特·奥本海默与其团队在美国对日本发动核时代第一波攻击之前取得的突破性发现。

For more than half a century, the handbook for how developing countries can grow rich hasn’t changed much: Move subsistence farmers into manufacturing jobs, and then sell what they produce to the rest of the world. The recipe — customized in varying ways by Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and China — has produced the most potent engine the world has ever known for generating economic growth. It has helped lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, create jobs and raise standards of living.
半个多世纪以来，发展中国家实现发展致富的指南没有太大的变化：将自给自足的农民转移到制造业，然后把他们生产的产品销售到世界其他地方。这套方法在香港、新加坡、韩国、台湾和中国以当地不同的方式定制，产生了全球有史以来最强有力的经济增长引擎，帮助数以亿计的人摆脱了贫困，创造了就业机会，提高了生活水平。

Two-thirds of the world’s output now comes from the service sector — a mishmash that includes dog walkers, manicurists, food preparers, cleaners and drivers, as well as highly trained chip designers, graphic artists, nurses, engineers and accountants. It is possible to leapfrog to the service sector and grow by selling to businesses around the world, Mr. Baldwin argued. That is what helped India become the world’s fifth-largest economy.
目前，全球三分之二的产出来自服务业。这是个包罗万象的行业，从业者包括遛狗者、美甲师、食品准备者、清洁工和司机，以及芯片设计师、平面设计师、护士、工程师和会计师等受过专业训练的人。鲍德温认为，有可能直接跨越到服务业，并通过向世界各地的企业提供服务来实现增长。这就是印度成为世界第五大经济体的方式。

Many developing nations remain focused on building export-oriented industries as the path to prosperity. And that’s how it should be, said Justin Yifu Lin, dean of the Institute of New Structural Economics at Peking University. Pessimism about the classic development formula, he said, has been fueled by a misguided belief that the growth process was automatic: Just clear the way for the free market and the rest will take care of itself.
许多发展中国家仍把重点放在建设出口导向型产业上，将其作为通往繁荣的道路。这是必由之路，北京大学新结构经济学研究院院长林毅夫说。他说，一个错误的信念助长了对经典发展模式的悲观看法，那就是认为增长过程是自动的：只要为自由市场扫清道路，剩下的事情会水到渠成。

Countries were often pressured by the United States and the international institutions to embrace open markets and hands-off governance.Export-led growth in Africa and Latin America stumbled because governments failed to protect and subsidize infant industries, said Mr. Lin, a former chief economist at the World Bank.“Industrial policy was taboo for a long time,” he said, and many of those who tried failed. But there were also success stories like China and South Korea.
各国经常受到美国和国际机构的压力，要求它们接受开放的市场和放手式的治理。非洲和拉丁美洲的出口导向型经济增长模式步履蹒跚，是因为政府未能保护和补贴新兴工业，曾任世界银行首席经济学家的林毅夫说。“产业政策长期以来一直是禁忌，”他说，许多尝试者都失败了。但也有中国和韩国这样的成功例子。

The overriding question is whether anything — services or manufacturing — can generate the type of growth that is desperately needed: broad based, large scale and sustainable.The mismatch is everywhere. Other kinds of service jobs are proliferating, too, but many are neither well paid nor exportable. A barber in Bengaluru can’t cut your hair if you’re in Brooklyn.That could mean smaller — and more uneven — growth.Researchers at Yale University found that in India and several countries in sub-Saharan Africa, agricultural workers jumped into consumer service jobs and raised their productivity and incomes.But there was a catch: The gains were “strikingly unequal” and disproportionately benefited the rich.
最重要的问题是，服务业也好，制造业也好，是否能带来全球迫切需要的那种基础广泛、规模庞大、可持续的增长？教育与工作岗位的不匹配到处可见。其他类型的服务工作岗位也在激增，但许多岗位的报酬不高，也不能出口。班加罗尔的理发师无法给住在布鲁克林的人理发。这可能意味着规模更小、更不均衡的经济增长。耶鲁大学的研究人员发现，在印度和撒哈拉以南非洲的几个国家，从事农业的人跨越到消费者服务行业后提高了他们自己的生产力和收入。但这里面有一个隐藏的问题：收入的分布“极其不平等”，而且富人不成比例地受益。

The first quake was alarming enough — a rumble more powerful than anything felt in Taiwan for a quarter-century, lasting for more than a minute on Wednesday morning, knocking belongings and even whole buildings askew. It was so strong it set off tsunami warnings in Japan, China and the Philippines.But then, even in a fault-riddled place with long and hard experience with earthquakes, the jolt of aftershock after aftershock was startling, continuing every few minutes throughout the day.
第一次地震已经足够令人担忧了——周三早上的轰隆声比四分之一个世纪以来台湾所感受到的任何一次地震都更强烈，震感持续了一分多钟，震碎物品，甚至将整栋建筑物震歪。地震强度大到触发了日本、中国和菲律宾的海啸警报。但是随后，即使是在这样一个断层遍布、长期遭受严重地震灾害的地方，一次又一次的余震也令人震惊，余震持续了一整天，每几分钟就发生一次。

The heaviest damage was in Hualien County, a lush, scenic area prone to earthquakes.In the city of Hualien, the county seat, rescuers were focused on a brick building with glass windows called the Uranus Building, which had partially collapsed and was leaning heavily to one side. Residents emerged through windows and climbed down ladders, assisted by rescuers.
受灾最严重的是花莲县，这是一个苍翠繁茂、风景优美的地区，容易发生地震。在花莲县县治所在地花莲市，救援的重点是天王星大楼，这座有玻璃窗的砖砌建筑已部分倒塌，严重向一侧倾斜。居民们在救援人员的帮助下爬出窗外，然后爬梯子下去。

Taiwan is at the intersection of the Philippine Sea tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate, making it vulnerable to seismic activity. Hualien sits on multiple active faults, and 17 people died in a quake there in 2018.The earthquake hit Taiwan as many people here were preparing to travel for Tomb Sweeping Day on Thursday, when, across the Chinese-speaking world, people mourn the dead and make offerings at their graves. The holiday weekend would typically see a spike in travel as people visit family across Taiwan.
台湾位于菲律宾海板块和欧亚板块的交汇处，因此很容易受到地震活动的影响。花莲位于多个活跃断层上，2018年有17人在一场地震中丧生。地震发生时，许多台湾人正在为周四的清明节出行做准备，在华语世界中，人们在这一天悼念逝者，并到墓前祭奠。通常，人们会到台湾各地探亲，因此周末假期会出现出行高峰。
