A worker currently at Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner factory in North Charleston, S.C., described seeing numerous problems on planes being assembled, including wires being routed incorrectly, raising the risk that they could rub against one another, resulting in damage. Boeing began to cut jobs and encouraged workers to take buyouts or retire early. It ultimately lost about 19,000 employees companywide — including some with decades of experience.
一名目前在南卡罗来纳州北查尔斯顿的波音787梦想飞机工厂工作的人称，他看到了组装飞机时的许多问题，包括电线的走线错误，这种错误会增加电线相互摩擦、导致损坏的风险。波音开始裁员，鼓励员工买断工龄或提前退休。全公司最终失去了约1.9万名员工，包括一些有几十年经验的员工。

“To single out Hong Kong and suggest that journalists would only experience concerns when operating here but not in other countries would be grossly biased, if not outrageous,” a government spokesman said in an emailed statement.
政府发言人在电子邮件声明中表示：“单单指责香港，并声称记者只有在香港工作时才会遇到麻烦，而在其他国家则不会，这种说法即使不是无理取闹，也是严重偏颇的。”

And when it comes to domestic politics, note the contrast. Trump made a big show of taking on China, but he was ineffective when in office and appears to have folded on TikTok when donor money was at stake. Biden talks more softly but is wielding a really big stick. Or to put it another way, Trump isn’t actually a tough guy on China; he just plays one on TV. Biden is the real deal.
当谈到国内政治时，请注意对比。特朗普大张旗鼓地展示了与中国的对抗，但他在任期间并未带来实际效果，而且在事关捐款时，他在TikTok这件事上似乎已经弃牌。拜登说话比较温和，但挥舞着一根大棒。或者换句话说，特朗普对中国其实并不是一个强硬的人，他只是在电视上表演强硬。拜登是来真的。

The court has made few specific details public, but Mr. Lin’s killing was, as a Chinese news outlet put it, “as bizarre as a Hollywood blockbuster.” Chinese media reports, citing sources in his company and court documents, have described a tale of deadly corporate ambition and rivalry with a macabre edge. Sidelined at work, Mr. Xu reportedly exacted vengeance with meticulous planning, including by testing poisons on small animals in a makeshift lab. (He not only killed Mr. Lin, but also poisoned his own replacement.)
虽然法院没有公开多少具体细节，但正如中国一家新闻媒体报道的那样，林奇被害一案“情节离奇堪比好莱坞大片”。中国媒体的报道引用林奇公司的消息来源和法庭文件，讲述了一个令人毛骨悚然的故事，其中充满致命的商业野心与竞争。据报道，许垚在公司被边缘化后精心策划了报复行动，包括在一个临时实验室里用小动物来测试毒药。（他不仅杀害了林奇，也给自己的继任者投了毒。）

Watching “Oppenheimer,” the Oscar-winning biopic about the father of the atomic bomb that opened in Japan on Friday, Kako Okuno was stunned by a scene in which scientists celebrated the explosion over Hiroshima with thunderous foot stomping and the waving of American flags. Ms. Okuno, who watched the film in Tokyo on Saturday, lamented that it did not reflect the experiences of the hundreds of thousands of atomic bomb victims in Hiroshima or Nagasaki.
周五，关于原子弹之父的奥斯卡获奖传记片《奥本海默》在日本上映，观影期间奥野佳子（音）被一场戏震惊了：科学家们用雷鸣般的跺脚和挥舞美国国旗来庆祝广岛上空的爆炸。奥野周六在东京观看了这部电影，她悲叹影片没有反映广岛或长崎数十万原子弹受害者的经历。

Eight months after Christopher Nolan’s film became a box office hit in the United States, “Oppenheimer” is now confronting Japanese audiences with the flip-side American perspective on the most scarring events of Japan’s history. The movie follows the breakthrough discoveries of J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team before the United States struck Japan with the first salvo of the nuclear age.
在美国票房大卖八个月后，克里斯托弗·诺兰的电影来到日本观众面前，将处在对立面的美国人眼中这起日本历史上最具创伤性的事件呈现给他们。影片讲述了J·罗伯特·奥本海默与其团队在美国对日本发动核时代第一波攻击之前取得的突破性发现。

For more than half a century, the handbook for how developing countries can grow rich hasn’t changed much: Move subsistence farmers into manufacturing jobs, and then sell what they produce to the rest of the world. The recipe — customized in varying ways by Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and China — has produced the most potent engine the world has ever known for generating economic growth. It has helped lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, create jobs and raise standards of living.
半个多世纪以来，发展中国家实现发展致富的指南没有太大的变化：将自给自足的农民转移到制造业，然后把他们生产的产品销售到世界其他地方。这套方法在香港、新加坡、韩国、台湾和中国以当地不同的方式定制，产生了全球有史以来最强有力的经济增长引擎，帮助数以亿计的人摆脱了贫困，创造了就业机会，提高了生活水平。

Two-thirds of the world’s output now comes from the service sector — a mishmash that includes dog walkers, manicurists, food preparers, cleaners and drivers, as well as highly trained chip designers, graphic artists, nurses, engineers and accountants. It is possible to leapfrog to the service sector and grow by selling to businesses around the world, Mr. Baldwin argued. That is what helped India become the world’s fifth-largest economy.
目前，全球三分之二的产出来自服务业。这是个包罗万象的行业，从业者包括遛狗者、美甲师、食品准备者、清洁工和司机，以及芯片设计师、平面设计师、护士、工程师和会计师等受过专业训练的人。鲍德温认为，有可能直接跨越到服务业，并通过向世界各地的企业提供服务来实现增长。这就是印度成为世界第五大经济体的方式。

Many developing nations remain focused on building export-oriented industries as the path to prosperity. And that’s how it should be, said Justin Yifu Lin, dean of the Institute of New Structural Economics at Peking University. Pessimism about the classic development formula, he said, has been fueled by a misguided belief that the growth process was automatic: Just clear the way for the free market and the rest will take care of itself.
许多发展中国家仍把重点放在建设出口导向型产业上，将其作为通往繁荣的道路。这是必由之路，北京大学新结构经济学研究院院长林毅夫说。他说，一个错误的信念助长了对经典发展模式的悲观看法，那就是认为增长过程是自动的：只要为自由市场扫清道路，剩下的事情会水到渠成。

Countries were often pressured by the United States and the international institutions to embrace open markets and hands-off governance.Export-led growth in Africa and Latin America stumbled because governments failed to protect and subsidize infant industries, said Mr. Lin, a former chief economist at the World Bank.“Industrial policy was taboo for a long time,” he said, and many of those who tried failed. But there were also success stories like China and South Korea.
各国经常受到美国和国际机构的压力，要求它们接受开放的市场和放手式的治理。非洲和拉丁美洲的出口导向型经济增长模式步履蹒跚，是因为政府未能保护和补贴新兴工业，曾任世界银行首席经济学家的林毅夫说。“产业政策长期以来一直是禁忌，”他说，许多尝试者都失败了。但也有中国和韩国这样的成功例子。

The overriding question is whether anything — services or manufacturing — can generate the type of growth that is desperately needed: broad based, large scale and sustainable.The mismatch is everywhere. Other kinds of service jobs are proliferating, too, but many are neither well paid nor exportable. A barber in Bengaluru can’t cut your hair if you’re in Brooklyn.That could mean smaller — and more uneven — growth.Researchers at Yale University found that in India and several countries in sub-Saharan Africa, agricultural workers jumped into consumer service jobs and raised their productivity and incomes.But there was a catch: The gains were “strikingly unequal” and disproportionately benefited the rich.
最重要的问题是，服务业也好，制造业也好，是否能带来全球迫切需要的那种基础广泛、规模庞大、可持续的增长？教育与工作岗位的不匹配到处可见。其他类型的服务工作岗位也在激增，但许多岗位的报酬不高，也不能出口。班加罗尔的理发师无法给住在布鲁克林的人理发。这可能意味着规模更小、更不均衡的经济增长。耶鲁大学的研究人员发现，在印度和撒哈拉以南非洲的几个国家，从事农业的人跨越到消费者服务行业后提高了他们自己的生产力和收入。但这里面有一个隐藏的问题：收入的分布“极其不平等”，而且富人不成比例地受益。

The first quake was alarming enough — a rumble more powerful than anything felt in Taiwan for a quarter-century, lasting for more than a minute on Wednesday morning, knocking belongings and even whole buildings askew. It was so strong it set off tsunami warnings in Japan, China and the Philippines.But then, even in a fault-riddled place with long and hard experience with earthquakes, the jolt of aftershock after aftershock was startling, continuing every few minutes throughout the day.
第一次地震已经足够令人担忧了——周三早上的轰隆声比四分之一个世纪以来台湾所感受到的任何一次地震都更强烈，震感持续了一分多钟，震碎物品，甚至将整栋建筑物震歪。地震强度大到触发了日本、中国和菲律宾的海啸警报。但是随后，即使是在这样一个断层遍布、长期遭受严重地震灾害的地方，一次又一次的余震也令人震惊，余震持续了一整天，每几分钟就发生一次。

The heaviest damage was in Hualien County, a lush, scenic area prone to earthquakes.In the city of Hualien, the county seat, rescuers were focused on a brick building with glass windows called the Uranus Building, which had partially collapsed and was leaning heavily to one side. Residents emerged through windows and climbed down ladders, assisted by rescuers.
受灾最严重的是花莲县，这是一个苍翠繁茂、风景优美的地区，容易发生地震。在花莲县县治所在地花莲市，救援的重点是天王星大楼，这座有玻璃窗的砖砌建筑已部分倒塌，严重向一侧倾斜。居民们在救援人员的帮助下爬出窗外，然后爬梯子下去。

Taiwan is at the intersection of the Philippine Sea tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate, making it vulnerable to seismic activity. Hualien sits on multiple active faults, and 17 people died in a quake there in 2018.The earthquake hit Taiwan as many people here were preparing to travel for Tomb Sweeping Day on Thursday, when, across the Chinese-speaking world, people mourn the dead and make offerings at their graves. The holiday weekend would typically see a spike in travel as people visit family across Taiwan.
台湾位于菲律宾海板块和欧亚板块的交汇处，因此很容易受到地震活动的影响。花莲位于多个活跃断层上，2018年有17人在一场地震中丧生。地震发生时，许多台湾人正在为周四的清明节出行做准备，在华语世界中，人们在这一天悼念逝者，并到墓前祭奠。通常，人们会到台湾各地探亲，因此周末假期会出现出行高峰。

And the Treasury secretary’s consumption of a dish made with psychedelic “magic” mushrooms at a Yunnan-style restaurant in Beijing sparked something of a culinary craze in China, where Ms. Yellen is popular for being an acclaimed economist.
在那次访华期间，她曾在北京一家云南风味的餐馆吃了一道用致幻“神奇”蘑菇制作的菜肴，在中国引发了对那道菜的热潮，作为一名著名经济学家，耶伦在中国广受欢迎。

They planned to follow that with a scenic boat cruise along the city’s Pearl River.But the first of four days of discussions about their economies was about more than pleasantries. She also warned that a surge of Chinese green technology products being sold below the cost of production will warp global supply chains by depressing prices and forcing firms worldwide to shutter.But if Ms. Yellen’s message about overcapacity is followed by tariffs or other U.S. trade restrictions, relations could quickly sour.
计划随后乘船游览珠江。但是，在为期四天的经济讨论中，第一天的讨论远不止客套话。她还警告说，大量中国绿色科技产品以低于生产成本的价格出售，将压低价格、迫使全球各地的企业倒闭，从而扭曲全球供应链。但如果耶伦发出产能过剩的信息后美国征收关税或采取其他贸易限制，中美关系可能很快就会恶化。

A report last month published by the Rhodium Group, a research firm, recalled that a Chinese stimulus program initiated after the 2008 financial crisis focusing on infrastructure and property construction led to a global glut of steel and aluminum products after demand for real estate weakened.Following the pandemic slowdown, China has focused on factory production to bolster its sputtering economy. 
研究公司荣鼎咨询上月发布的报告称，2008年金融危机后，中国启动了一项刺激计划，重点关注基础设施和房地产建设，在房地产需求减弱后，导致全球钢铁和铝产品供过于求。在疫情放缓之后，中国一直把重点放在工厂生产上，以提振疲弱的经济。

Earthquakes are unavoidable in Taiwan, which sits on multiple active faults. Decades of work learning from other disasters, implementing strict building codes and increasing public awareness have gone into helping its people weather frequent strong quakes.We have retrofitted more than 10,000 school buildings in the last 20 years,The government had also helped reinforce private apartment buildings over the past six years by adding new steel braces and increasing column and beam sizes
台湾位于多条活跃断层上，地震不可避免。数十年来，台湾从其他灾难中吸取教训，实施了严格的建筑规范，提高公众意识，这些都有助于民众抵御频繁发生的强烈地震。在过去20年里，我们已经改造了1万多座校舍,过去六年来，政府还通过添加新的钢支撑以及加粗柱和梁的尺寸来帮助加固私人公寓楼。

Not far from the Uranus Building, for example, officials had inspected a building with cracked pillars and concluded that it was dangerous to stay in. Residents were given 15 minutes to dash inside and retrieve as many belongings as they could. Some ran out with computers, while others threw bags of clothes out of windows onto the street, which was also still littered with broken glass and cement fragments from the quake.
例如，在离天王星大楼不远的地方，官员们检查了一栋柱子开裂的大楼，认定呆在里面很危险。居民们有15分钟的时间冲进楼里，尽可能多地取走自己的物品。一些人拿着电脑跑了出来，另一些人则把一袋袋衣服从窗户扔到街上，街上还到处是地震留下的碎玻璃和水泥碎片。

Taiwan has made strides in its response to disasters, experts say. In the first 24 hours after the quake, rescuers freed hundreds of people who were trapped in cars in between rockfalls on the highway and stranded on mountain ledges in rock quarries.
专家表示，台湾在应对灾害方面取得了长足进步。地震发生后的最初24小时内，救援人员解救了数以百计人员，他们被困在高速公路落石之间的汽车中，还有人被困在采石场山脊上。

China has passed a demographic Rubicon just as many other countries have before it. The problem of underfunded retirement programs is not unique to China, either. But China’s demographic and economic troubles are colliding, shaking confidence in the pension system.China’s leaders could begin to tackle the problem by raising an “alarmingly low” retirement age
和其它许多国家一样，中国已经渡过了人口的卢比孔河。资金不足的养老金计划并非中国独有的问题。但中国的人口和经济困境的同时到来动摇了人们对这一系统的信心。中国领导人可以通过提高“低到惊人”的退休年龄来应对这一问题

But over the past year another problem has emerged: More people, whether they are unemployed or doing part-time or freelance work, are pausing their contributions or simply opting out.In some prosperous regions, as many as eight workers support each retiree. But in poorer areas, there are about two workers for every retiree.
但在过去的一年里，另一个问题出现了：越来越多的人，无论是失业者，还是兼职或自由职业者，都在暂停缴纳养老金，或者干脆不缴纳养老金。在一些繁荣地区，多达八名工人供养一个退休人员。但在较贫穷的地区，大约是两个工人供养一个退休人员。

I made myself sit through this violent scene. I have never seen what was known as a struggle session depicted blow-by-blow on the screen. I also felt compelled to watch it because of how the series, a Netflix adaptation of China’s most celebrated works of science fiction, has been received in China.Instead, many comments zeroed in on how unflatteringly China is portrayed and how few Chinese elements are included in the series. Netflix isn’t available in China but viewers flocked to see pirated versions of “3 Body Problem.”
我强迫自己看完了这个暴力场景。此前，我从未在屏幕上看到“批斗会”被如此活生生地展现出来过。由于这部网飞根据中国最著名的科幻作品改编的剧集在中国引起的反响，我也觉得必须看完这个场景。许多评论反而集中在该剧对中国的描绘多么有损形象、剧中的中国元素多么少等问题上。虽然网飞的服务范围不包括中国，但不少人已看过《3体》的盗版。

Marisa Peters had been experiencing symptoms for years: blood on her toilet paper after going to the bathroom, changes in her stool and difficulty controlling the urge to poop. But she was in her 30s, healthy and physically active. She did not have any abdominal pain, and doctors dismissed the symptoms as hemorrhoids, or normal postpartum changes after the birth of her first son. When Ms. Peters finally visited a gastroenterologist in 2021, after having her third child and experiencing worsening bleeding from her rectum along with changes in her stool consistency, an urgent colonoscopy confirmed that she had colorectal cancer.
玛丽莎·彼得斯多年来一直有这些症状：上完厕所后卫生纸上有血迹，大便发生变化，以及难以控制排便的冲动。但她才30多岁，身体健康，喜欢运动。她没有腹痛，医生认为是痔疮导致她的那些症状，或者是生完第一个儿子后的正常产后变化。2021年，在生了第三个孩子后，彼得斯终于去看了肠胃科医生，当时她的直肠出血的情况变严重了，大便粘稠度也发生了变化，紧急结肠镜检查证实她患有结直肠癌。

Some research has linked lifestyle and dietary changes to increased rates of colorectal cancer in both young people and older adults. Recent generations have consumed more red meat, ultraprocessed foods and sugary beverages, and have been known to binge drink more frequently; between 1992 and 1998, cigarette smoking also increased before declining again, while physical activity has continuously declined for decades. All of these factors — along with the rise in obesity rates since the 1980s — are associated with cancer risk. But once again, none of them fully account for the increase in early-onset colorectal cancer.
一些研究将生活方式、饮食变化与年轻人和年龄更大的人当中患结直肠癌的增加联系起来。近几代人消费了更多红肉、精加工食品和含糖饮料，并且更频繁地饮酒；在1992年至1998年间，吸烟也增加了，然后再次下降，而体育锻炼在过去几十年里持续减少。所有这些因素——以及自上世纪80年代以来肥胖率的上升——都与癌症风险有关。然而，再一次强调，这些因素并不能完全解释早发性结直肠癌的增加。

President Biden has intensified efforts to shield American industries from foreign competition in an election year, as he courts blue-collar workers and attempts to avoid being outflanked on trade by his Republican rival, former President Donald J. Trump.The moves have strained Mr. Biden’s relationships with international allies and rivals alike, drawing charges of protectionism from diplomats and some economists
在大选年，拜登总统加大了保护美国工业不受外国竞争影响的力度，他向蓝领工人示好，试图避免在贸易问题上被共和党对手、前总统特朗普占先。这些举措使拜登与国际盟友和竞争对手的关系变得紧张，招来外交官和一些经济学家指责他实施保护主义

when South Koreans go to the polls on Wednesday, they will also be signaling support for one of two leaders who are locked in what is known here as “gladiator politics.”The do-or-die rivalry between President Yoon Suk Yeol and the opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, whose party holds the majority in the National Assembly, has made the elections as fraught with fear and resentment as any in South Korea​n history. Neither leader commands broad popularity, instead relying on hard-line supporters who either want to see Mr. Yoon, a conservative, impeached for abuse of power, or Mr. Lee, a progressive, imprisoned for corruption.
但当韩国人周三投票时，他们也将向两位领导人之一发出支持的信号，两人正在进行被韩国人称为“角斗士政治”的角逐。总统尹锡悦和反对党领袖李在明（他所在的政党在国会占多数席位）之间你死我活的竞争，使这次选举和韩国历史上的选举一样，充满恐惧和怨恨。两位领导人都没有得到广泛的民众基础，而是依靠强硬的支持者，这些人要么希望看到保守派的尹锡悦因滥用权力而被弹劾，要么希望进步派的李在明因腐败而入狱。

Mr. Lee, a son of public toilet cleaners, was a teenage sweatshop worker in rubber and glove factories before becoming a labor lawyer, a mayor and a provincial governor. His supporters see him as an outspoken outsider who can fix establishment politics. But his critics call him a devious populist who cut corrupt deals while in office and quashed dissenting voices within his party in attempts to consolidate power.
李在明是公共厕所清洁工的儿子，青少年时期曾在生产橡胶和手套的血汗工厂工作，后来成为劳工律师、市长和知事。支持者认为他是一个敢于直言的局外人，可以修复建制政治。但批评者称他是一个狡猾的民粹主义者，执政期间进行腐败交易，在党内压制反对声音，试图巩固权力。

Mr. Yoon, a son of a college professor, was an elite prosecutor, rising to the ranks of prosecutor-general before becoming president. His supporters praise him for strengthening ties with the United States in the face of nuclear threats from North Korea. But his detractors call him a hamfisted elitist who favors the rich and uses coercive measures to silence critics.
尹锡悦是大学教授的儿子，是一名精英检察官，在成为总统之前曾担任检察总长。支持者称赞他在面对朝鲜核威胁时加强了与美国的关系。但批评者称他是一个拙劣的精英主义者，偏袒富人，使用强制措施来压制批评者。

“There is no place for dictatorships, hegemony, neocolonial and colonial practices, which are now being widely used by the United States and the rest of the ‘collective West,’” Mr. Lavrov said.Mr. Wang’s remarks were more measured — a reflection of China’s difficult balancing act in supporting Russia while also trying to avoid alienating important trading partners in Western Europe.
“美国和其他‘西方集体’国家正在广泛采用独裁、霸权、新殖民主义和殖民主义的做法，这是行不通的，”拉夫罗夫说。王毅的讲话则更加谨慎，这反映出中国在支持俄罗斯的同时，又努力避免疏远西欧重要贸易伙伴之间的艰难平衡。

Now that same infrastructure, backed by billions of dollars from the Japanese government, is being built about 750 miles away in the cow pastures and cabbage fields of Kikuyo in southwestern Japan.Chemical companies and equipment makers are vying for a piece of the semiconductor economy. 
现在，在日本政府数十亿美元的支持下，台积电正在大约1200公里之外日本西南部菊阳町的牧牛场和菜田里建设同样的基础设施。化学公司和设备制造商们正在争夺半导体经济的生意。

At rush hour in Kikuyo one day last month, the train platform at once-sleepy Haramizu station was crowded with workers from TSMC suppliers like Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron. Some carried hard hats in clear plastic backpacks while they waited for the train into Kumamoto, the nearest big city.
在上月一个上下班高峰时段，菊阳町曾经宁静的原水火车站站台上挤满了为应用材料公司、东京电子等台积供应商工作的工人。一些人携带的透明塑料背包中有安全帽，他们在等待开往最近的大城市熊本的火车。

On a recent night in a tatami-paneled banquet hall in Kumamoto, the city 10 miles from the new TSMC factory, visiting investors from Taiwan exchanged gifts with their hosts, a local chamber of commerce. Bottles of Kirin beer, tiny glasses of sake, T-shirts and key chains were passed around and plates of sushi placed in front of each person. “To all the money we’re going to make,” went the final toast.
最近的一个晚上，在距台积电新厂16公里的熊本市的一个铺着榻榻米的宴会厅里，来访的台湾投资者与东道主（一家当地商会）交换了礼物。就餐者相互传递着瓶装麒麟啤酒、小杯清酒、T恤衫和钥匙链，每个人前面摆着一盘寿司。“为我们将要赚到的钱干杯”是祝酒词的最后一句。

If war breaks out between the two sides of the strait, that would put an unbearable burden on the Chinese nation,The Chinese people on both sides of the Strait absolutely have the wisdom to peacefully handle the various disputes and avoid going toward conflict.
两岸如果发生战火，对中华民族都是不可承受之重，两岸的中国人，绝对有足够的智慧，和平处理各项争端，避免走向冲突。

During a pomp-filled ceremony honoring the visiting Japanese prime minister, the president said the United States and Japan would create an expanded defense architecture with Australia, participate in three-way military exercises with Britain and explore ways for Japan to join a U.S.-led coalition with Australia and Britain.
在为到访日本首相举行的盛大仪式上，拜登总统说，美国和日本将与澳大利亚建立一个扩大的防务架构，参加与英国的三方军事演习，并探讨日本如何加入美国领导的与澳大利亚和英国的联盟。

Other gifts included a lithograph and a two-volume LP set autographed by Billy Joel and a vintage vinyl record collection. Dr. Biden gave Ms. Kishida a framed painting of the Yoshino cherry tree that the two had planted on the South Lawn last spring, and a soccer ball signed by the U.S. women’s national soccer team and the Japanese women’s team.At the state dinner, the White House was scheduled to serve a meal that would include house-cured salmon and dry-aged rib-eye steak with blistered shishito pepper butter.
其它的礼物包括一幅版画、有比利·乔签名的一套双张黑胶唱片，以及一套黑胶老唱片收藏。拜登博士送给岸田夫人一幅经过装裱的画，画中是两人去年春天在白宫南草坪种下的一棵吉野樱树，以及一只有美国和日本女子足球国家队签名的足球。在国宴上，白宫计划的菜品包括自家熏制的三文鱼和干式熟成的眼肉牛排，佐以烤狮子唐辣椒调制的黄油。

More than a year ago, NetEase and Blizzard called an end to their long-running partnership when renewal talks turned testy, with both sides accusing each other of bad-faith negotiations. An uproar ensued among Chinese gamers, upset about losing access to a slew of popular titles from Blizzard’s parent company, the U.S. game developer Activision Blizzard.
一年多前，网易和暴雪的续约谈判不欢而散，双方宣布结束长期合作伙伴关系，并且都指责对方缺乏诚意。这在中国游戏玩家当中引发了轩然大波，他们对于无法再玩暴雪母公司美国游戏开发商动视暴雪旗下的一系列热门游戏感到不满。

Mr. Yoon needs help from the opposition in addressing runaway housing prices, a rapidly aging population and a long-delayed overhaul of the national pension system. 
尹锡悦需要反对党的帮助来解决房价失控、迅速老龄化的人口以及拖延已久的国家养老金制度改革等问题。

Western countries relied on coal for well over a century, which is why, in no small part, they account for the majority of historical greenhouse gas emissions.In an attempt to balance financial responsibility for the energy transition, richer countries have pooled tens of billions of dollars in loans to some coal-reliant developing countries.For now, however, much of that money remains undisbursed as stakeholders iron out disagreements.
西方国家依赖煤炭已远不止一个世纪，这在很大程度上解释了它们导致了半数以上历史上温室气体排放总量的原因。为了平衡能源转型的财务责任，富裕国家已集资数百亿美元，将为依赖煤炭的发展中国家提供贷款.但其中大部分资金目前尚未花出去，因为利益相关方仍在解决分歧。

O.J. Simpson, who died on Wednesday at 76, lived a life that made him one of the most famous people in America, as well as, at various times, the most celebrated and most reviled.A Heisman Trophy winner when he played football at the University of Southern California, he reached superstar status as a running back with the Buffalo Bills. As a commercial pitchman and a Hollywood actor, he became a household name across much of America.
O·J·辛普森于周三去世，享年76岁。他的一生使他成为美国最著名的人物之一，在不同的人生阶段里，他的声誉也在万众敬仰和万人唾骂之间摇摆。在南加州大学打橄榄球时，他获得了海斯曼奖；在布法罗比尔队担任跑卫时，他成了超级巨星。作为商业推销员和好莱坞演员，他在美国大多数地方家喻户晓。

For years, Israeli officials have argued, both in public and in private, that the harder Iran is hit, the warier it will be about fighting back. Iran’s barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles on Saturday — the first direct attack by Iran on Israel — has overturned that logic.The accumulated experience of Israel is that Iran doesn’t have good means to retaliate,There was a strong feeling that they don’t want to be involved in the war.
多年来，以色列官员无论是在公开场合还是私下里都认为，伊朗受到的打击越大，它就越不敢反击。伊朗周六发射的300多架无人机和导弹推翻了这一逻辑，这是伊朗对以色列发动的首次直接攻击。以色列积累的经验是，伊朗没有好的报复手段，之前以色列有一种强烈的感觉，那就是伊朗不想卷入战争。

Mr. Cauchi was shot and killed after Amy Scott, a police inspector, who was conducting routine duties nearby, was directed into the shopping center, where he lunged at her with his weapon.
有人把在附近执行例行任务的巡警艾米·斯科特带到购物中心，考奇持刀向她扑来，她开枪将其击毙。

Mr. Modi, a strongman who controls every lever of power in India and has expanded its relations with many other countries, appears uncharacteristically powerless in the face of the rupture with China.As Mr. Modi seeks a third term in an election that begins on Friday, the tensions weigh heavily on the overarching narrative of his campaign
莫迪是一个铁腕人物，控制着印度的每一个权力层面，并扩大了与许多其他国家的关系。但面对与中国的关系破裂，他似乎显得异常无力。随着莫迪在周五开始的选举中寻求第三个任期，紧张的局势严重影响了他竞选活动的总体叙事

A Chinese company targeted by members of Congress over potential ties to the Chinese government makes blockbuster drugs for the American market that have been hailed as advances in the treatment of cancers, obesity and debilitating illnesses like cystic fibrosis.
由于与中国政府的潜在关系，一家为美国市场生产重磅药物的中国公司成为了国会议员的攻击目标。这家公司生产的药物被认为在癌症、肥胖症以及囊性纤维化等严重损伤身体的疾病方面取得了重大进展。

WuXi is heavily embedded in the U.S. medicine chest, making some or all of the main ingredients for multibillion-dollar therapies that are highly sought to treat cancers like some types of leukemia and lymphoma as well as obesity and H.I.V.The Congressional spotlight on the company has rattled the pharmaceutical industry, which is already struggling with widespread drug shortages now at a 20-year high. 
美国人用的许多药都离不开药明康德，这家公司为美国市场上销售额高达数十亿美元的药物生产部分或全部主要成分，包括广泛用于某些类型的白血病和淋巴瘤等癌症，以及肥胖症和艾滋病毒的治疗药物。美国国会对药明康德的关注让制药行业感到不安，该行业已经面临广泛的药品短缺问题，目前处于20年来的最严重程度。

WuXi AppTec and an affiliated company, WuXi Biologics grew rapidly, offering services to major U.S. drugmakers that were seeking to shed costs and had shifted most manufacturing overseas in the last several decades.WuXi companies developed a reputation for low-cost and reliable work by thousands of chemists who could create new molecules and operate complex equipment to make them in bulk.Some public records, show that WuXi and its affiliates have made the active ingredients for critical drugs. 
药明康德及其一家子公司药明生物的快速发展源自为美国的主要制药商提供服务。为了削减成本，美国制药商已在过去几十年里将大部分生产转移到海外。药明系有成本低、产品可靠的声誉，并雇佣了数以千计的化学家，他们能开发新分子并操作批量生产它们的复杂设备。一些公开记录显示，药明康德及其附属公司一直在生产关键药物的活性成分。

Mary Aravanopoulos stood clutching her daughter, huddling for safety with about 15 other women in the dress shop filled with ethereal organza gowns. They had watched a man saunter past in the mall corridor, unhurriedly, swinging a large knife in his hand back and forth.
玛丽·阿拉瓦诺普洛斯抱着女儿，和其他15个女人挤在一起，躲在这家摆满飘逸欧根纱礼服的店里。她们看着一个男人在商场过道里不慌不忙地悠闲走过，来回舞动着手里的大刀。

“Bros-supports-bros culture is so deeply and inherently tied in with the Australian idea of masculinity,” she said. “That real testosterone-laden idea of what masculinity represents, there’s a pop culture mainstream representation of it that gets constantly reinforced.”With the belief that the attacker was singling out women, she said she shuddered to think what would have happened if the young, female store managers had not acted quickly and pulled down the shutters.
“兄弟支持兄弟的文化与澳大利亚人对男子气的概念有着根深蒂固的内在联系，”她说。“那种充斥着睾丸激素的男子气概观念，有一种流行文化的主流表现形式，并不断得到强化。”她认为袭击者是专门针对女性的，她说，如果当时年轻的女店长没有迅速采取行动拉下百叶窗，接下来可能发生的情形令她不寒而栗。

Jiuben is on the fourth floor of Pano City Mall, where restaurants advertising Korean, Japanese and Chinese food operate next to empty storefronts. Some places look abandoned: The lights are off but a pile of takeaway boxes sits by the till, lamps still hanging or chairs and tables intact.Centered around three curved, pebble-like buildings designed by Zaha Hadid, the neighborhood of Wangjing was once a hub of activity for the capital’s busiest workers. 
九本居酒屋位于望京新荟城三楼，这个商场聚集了韩餐、日餐和中餐，旁边许多店面都空着。有些地方看起来像是废弃了一般：灯都关着，但收银台旁放着一堆外卖盒子，灯还挂着，桌椅都没有被动过。以扎哈·哈迪德设计的三座弧形鹅卵石状建筑为中心，望京曾经是北京最繁忙的打工人活动中心。

Ms. Kou started her business more than eight years ago, selling baked goods like bitter melon bagels and ube mochi twists. Now she places less emphasis on developing new baked goods with different flavors. Instead, she focuses on keeping costs low so that the bakery can offer cheaper prices.
寇月圆8年多前开始了她的生意，销售苦瓜贝果和麻糬等烘焙食品。现在，她不再像过去那样花精力开发不同口味的新品种。相反，她专注于压低成本，这样面包店就能提供更便宜的价格。

Beijing is sure to welcome the message that German businesses are committed to China. The Asian giant is trying to court foreign investment to reinvigorate its economy, which has faltered because of a housing slowdown.From China’s perspective, Germany may be its best hope of delaying or watering down any trade restrictions from Europe
中国政府肯定会欢迎德国企业致力于与中国做生意的信息。这个亚洲巨人的经济受房地产市场放缓的拖累已陷入困境，正努力吸引外资重振经济。从中国的角度来看，德国也许是推迟或淡化任何来自欧洲的贸易限制的最佳希望

That leaves Mr. Scholz facing the delicate act of balancing the export-oriented needs of his domestic economy with pressure from allies to leverage his country’s position to make demands on the Chinese.
这让肖尔茨面临着一个微妙的平衡问题，既要满足本国经济的出口导向型需求，又要满足来自盟友的压力，以便利用本国的地位向中国提出要求。

And in the first three years of Mr. Biden’s presidency, the Middle East seemed relatively calm, until the Oct. 7 terror attack by Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis, upended his priorities and plunged the White House back into a familiar cauldron.While Mr. Biden used intermediaries to help assure that Iran’s retaliatory strikes over the weekend did not spin out of control — and Iran appeared intent on keeping indirect lines open
在拜登担任总统的头三年里，中东似乎相对平静，直到10月7日哈马斯发动的恐怖袭击导致1200名以色列人丧生，颠覆了他对轻重缓急的安排，让白宫重新陷入熟悉的困境。虽然拜登利用中间人来帮助确保伊朗周末的报复性袭击不会失控，而且伊朗似乎也有意保持间接线路的畅通

In the rush to diversify away from oil, many leaders in the region have set their sights on A.I. — and have been happy to play the United States and China off each other.
在急于从石油资源转向多元化过程中，该地区的许多领导人将目光投向了人工智能，并乐意让美国和中国相互博弈。

The four athletes ran in a group for much of the race, the livestream showed, ahead of the rest of the pack, with the African runners occasionally pulling slightly ahead.But it was the final moments of the race, when Mnangat and Keter both appeared to gesture to He to run in front of the others, that raised questions.
直播画面显示，在比赛的大部分时间里，四名运动员都是跑在同一组，领先于其他选手，期间非洲选手偶尔会稍稍领先。但在比赛的最后时刻，姆南加特和凯特都似乎示意何杰跑到他们前面，这引发了质疑。

In 2018, 258 participants were penalized for cheating in the Shenzhen Half Marathon, with organizers accusing them of wearing fake bib numbers, hiring imposters and taking shortcuts, according to Chinese state media.
据中国官方媒体报道，2018年，深圳半程马拉松赛中有258名参赛者因作弊受到处罚，组织者指控他们佩戴假号码布、雇佣冒名顶替者以及走捷径。

The sharpened debate is sure to be on display at the economic lollapalooza that opens Wednesday in Washington — otherwise known as the annual spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.There are different ways of shooting yourself in the foot,The current wave of policies, though, is a stark contrast to the classic open markets, hands-off government ideology championed by the citadels of capitalism in recent decades.
周三于华盛顿开幕的国际货币基金组织和世界银行年度春季会议这一经济盛事之上，肯定会出现关于这一话题的激烈争论。搬起石头砸自己的脚有很多种不同的方法,然而，当前的政策浪潮与近几十年来资本主义阵营所倡导的典型开放市场、政府不干涉的意识形态形成了剧烈反差。

The United States passed two mammoth bills in 2022 to strengthen its domestic semiconductor industry and renewable energy sector. Europe passed its own Green Deal Industrial Plan last year to speed the energy transition.Positive appraisals of the approach have grown in recent years. a Harvard economist, found that the “recent crop of papers offers in general a more positive take on industrial policy,” compared with the traditional “knee-jerk opposition from economists.”
美国在2022年通过了两项庞大的法案，以加强国内半导体产业和可再生能源产业。欧洲去年通过了自己的《绿色交易产业计划》，以加速能源转型。近年来，对这种方法的正面评价在增加。哈佛大学经济学家丹尼·罗德里克等人组成的团队对此做了综述，发现，与传统的“经济学家下意识的反对”相比，“最近的一批论文总体上对产业政策提出了更正面的看法”。

WADA said “the contamination scenario was further supported” by the low concentrations of the drug and the fluctuation of test results between positive and negative.The Chinese pointed to low concentrations of TMZ in the urine samples to conclude intentional doping was “impossible.”To reduce that risk, WADA is expected to step in whenever doubts emerge, or if national bodies appear to have favored their own athletes.A large cluster of positive tests and an unusual claim of mass contamination through tainted food, then, might have merited a deeper, and independent, investigation.
世界反兴奋剂组织说，样品中药物的浓度低，以及药检结果时而阳性、时而阴性的情况，“进一步支持了厨房受污染的情况”。中国的报告指出尿液样本中的TMZ浓度低，因此得出了“不可能”是故意服用兴奋剂的结论。为了降低这种风险，只要有人提出怀疑，或如果国家的反兴奋剂机构似乎偏袒本国运动员时，世界反兴奋剂组织按理就该介入。这样的话，集中出现的大量药检阳性结果，以及这种不寻常的说法——这些结果是众多运动员吃了受污染食品造成的——可能原本值得进行更深入的独立调查。

Dr. Nicholls added that, to his knowledge, this study is the first to measure subsidence across many urban areas at once using state-of-the-art radar data from satellites.Subsidence in these cities is caused in part by the sheer weight of buildings and infrastructure, the study found. Pumping water from aquifers underneath the cities also plays a role, as do oil drilling and coal mining, all activities that leave empty space underground where soil and rocks can compact or collapse.Land subsidence is an overlooked problem that almost exists everywhere
尼科尔斯还表示，据他所知，这项研究是第一次使用最先进的卫星雷达数据同时测量许多城市地区的下沉情况。研究发现，这些城市的下沉部分是由建筑物和基础设施的巨大重量造成的。从城市地下含水层抽水也起了作用，石油钻探和煤矿开采也是如此，所有这些活动都会在地下留下空间，可能造成土壤和岩石的压实或坍塌。地面沉降是一个被忽视的问题，几乎在任何地方都存在

Since China’s first nuclear weapons test, in 1964, the country has pledged loudly to never go first in a nuclear conflict — no matter what. That stance, coupled with a stated strategy of “minimum” deterrence, didn’t demand the level of American fear, loathing and attention that the Russian threat did.
自1964年中国首次进行核武器试验以来，中国一直高声承诺，无论发生什么情况，永远不会首先使用核武器。这种立场，再加上“最低限度”威慑的既定战略，并没有像俄罗斯的威胁那样引起美国人的恐惧、厌恶和关注。

It may seem like a no-brainer to take China up on the offer — wouldn’t it be better if everyone agreed not to be the first to use their nuclear weapons? — but it has been met with public silence from Washington. For American policymakers, committing to no-first-use is deeply divisive. 
接受中国的提议似乎是理所当然的——如果每个国家都同意不首先使用核武器，那不是更好吗——但华盛顿在公开层面上却对此保持沉默。对于美国决策者来说，承诺不首先使用核武器会引发严重分歧。

The Biden administration is wrestling with how it can deter both China and Russia without touching off a destabilizing three-way arms race. Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, publicly invited the two nations last summer to hold nuclear arms control deliberations without preconditions. Russia dismissed the offer outright, while China agreed to preliminary talks.U.S. administrations have not responded with great alacrity or interest to Chinese outreach on the question of no-first-use
去年夏天的时候，拜登的国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文曾公开邀请这两个国家举行不设先决条件的核军备控制磋商。俄罗斯直接拒绝了这一提议，而中国同意进行初步会谈。对于中国在不首先使用核武器问题上的主动提议，美国历届政府并没有做出非常积极或感兴趣的回应

It may be that an unequivocal no-first-use pledge ends up being impossible. The talks may not result in a deal anyone can agree upon, and even if a deal were to be reached, it would be impossible to verify, meaning it would be more symbolic than substantive. 
或许，最终并不能达成明确的不首先使用核武器的承诺。谈判可能不会达成所有人都同意的协议，而且即使达成了协议，也可能无法查证核实，这意味着它的象征意义大于实质意义。

Pinduoduo felt more like a gimmick than a future rival. It was a combination of a game arcade, a shopping mall and a social network. Its main selling point was lower prices for shoppers who recruited other buyers to make group purchases. Customers could pass the time by playing video games or earn money by logging in daily to browse the app.Now, no one is taking the company lightly.
那时，拼多多给人的感觉更像是个噱头，而不是未来竞争对手。该应用把游戏厅、购物平台和社交网络结合起来，主要卖点是为“拼团”的购物者提供更低的价格。用户在上面玩视频游戏来打发时间，或通过每天登录应用程序浏览内容赚点钱。现在，人们不再轻视这家公司。

Pinduoduo, which did not respond to requests for comment, grew by word of mouth because it offered steep discounts. Sharing the bargains online was easy because Pinduoduo was deeply intertwined with Tencent’s WeChat, a ubiquitous messaging service in China.The main appeal of Pinduoduo is its shockingly low prices. A 5.5-pound box of cherry tomatoes costs about $4.50, but the price per box is cut in half if another person joins to make a “team purchase.” A dozen rolls of five-ply toilet paper cost 80 cents. Both are delivered free. 
拼多多靠口头传开的大幅折扣实现了增长。因为拼多多与中国无处不在的短信平台——腾讯的微信紧密相联，用户在网上分享特价商品很容易。拼多多的主要吸引力在于平台上的价格低得惊人。一盒五斤的樱桃西红柿售价不到35元，但如果另一个人加入“团购”的话，每盒的价格将减半。卷纸五层的12卷卫生纸售价不到六元。而且都是免费送货。

In its early days, Pinduoduo was overrun with knockoffs. It took aggressive steps to address the issue. Buyers who receive counterfeit goods are eligible for a refund of up to 10 times their money from the seller. Sellers provide a refund with no questions asked if a customer is dissatisfied with a purchase.For sellers, the huge traffic to the app is the draw. 
早期的拼多多平台上曾充斥着假货。公司采取了积极的措施来解决这个问题。收到假货的买家有资格从卖家那里获得最高10倍的退款。如果顾客对买来的东西不满意，可以退货，卖家不问任何问题就会退款。对卖家来说，吸引他们的是拼多多带来的巨大流量。

Such statements of altruism run at odds with some of the company’s tactics, critics say. Last year, the Google Play store suspended Pinduoduo’s app outside China after cybersecurity experts found that it was laced with malware. 
批评人士称，这些利他主义言论与公司的一些做法相矛盾。去年，Google Play商店暂停了拼多多应用程序在中国境外的下载，因为网络安全专家发现该应用程序中有大量恶意软件。

He reserves fear for one person, Melania Trump.At the end of the day, she could probably make or break him.Melania was tugged back into the news this week as her husband went on trial in Manhattan on charges stemming from his supposed dalliance with the porn star Stormy Daniels. Journalists wanted to know what Melania Trump was thinking. The judge presiding over the trial said that she could theoretically be called to testify.
他只怕一个人，梅拉尼娅·特朗普。到头来，他的成与败可能是由她决定的。随着她的丈夫因与色情明星“风暴丹尼尔斯”的风流事而导致的指控在曼哈顿接受审判，梅拉尼娅再次成为新闻焦点。记者们想知道梅拉尼娅·特朗普在想什么。主审法官说，理论上，她可以被传唤作证。

And Donald Trump fumed to reporters that the trial might prevent him from joining Melania at the high school graduation of their son, Barron, on May 17.In this case, the truth really is opaque.All these years and tweets and town halls and tirades since he came down that infernal escalator, there’s still stuff that we don’t know about a man who is, paradoxically, perhaps the greatest exhibitionist ever to reach the pinnacle of American politics. He over-shares his every absurd irritation and eccentric rumination. He is forever beseeching us to look at him, look at him, look at him.
唐纳德·特朗普愤怒地对记者们说，审判可能会妨碍他在5月17日与梅拉尼娅一起参加他们儿子巴伦的高中毕业典礼。在这种情况下，真相确实是不透明的。自从他从那通往地狱的自动扶梯上下来之后，这么多年来，他的推文、市政厅集会露面和咆哮之中，仍然有一些我们不知道的东西，吊诡的是，他可能是有史以来达到美国政治顶峰的最伟大的暴露癖。他过度分享自己的每一个荒谬的愤怒和古怪的遐想。他总是恳求我们看看他，看看他，再看看他。

Are his family members’ meanings to him more ornamental than sentimental? Again, I can’t tell. It’s possible that Ivanka’s emphatic exit from his political life wounds him greatly and that Don Jr.’s clinging presence touches him deeply.It’s possible that he views them as transactional figures, making decisions based entirely on their own immediate interests — apples fallen close to the tree.
对他来说，家庭成员的装饰意义是不是大于情感意义？我还是不知道。伊万卡断然退出他的政治生活，可能对他造成了极大的伤害，而小唐纳德对他的执着则深深打动了他。他有可能把他们看作是交易数字，做决定时完全是从自己的直接利益出发——有其父必有其子。

And Melania? How much does she matter to him, and vice versa? I draw no conclusions because I accept the adage that nobody outside a marriage has any firm grasp of what goes on inside it. And she gives away nothing, a paragon of inscrutability. She disappears, she reappears, she wears a jacket with the words “I really don’t care, do u?” scrawled across the back.
梅拉尼娅呢？她对他来说有多重要，他对她又有多重要呢？我没有得出任何结论，因为我接受这句格言：清官难断家务事。她什么也不透露，堪称高深莫测的典范。她消失了，又出现了，身穿一件夹克，背面潦草地写着“我真的不在乎，你呢？”

The trial that began with jury selection on Monday is in part an excavation of Donald Trump’s private life, as lawyers argue over, and the judge rules on, whether certain details about his reputed infidelities are relevant. But there’s much that these proceedings won’t bring to the surface.
周一以挑选陪审团成员开始的审判在一定程度上是对唐纳德·特朗普私人生活的挖掘，关于他被指控为不忠的某些细节是否重要，律师们要就此进行争论，法官要就此做出裁决。但这些诉讼不会暴露太多东西。

From the American neoliberal economic viewpoint, a state-led push like this might seem illegitimate or even unfair. The state, with its subsidies and political directives, is making decisions that are better left to the markets, the thinking goes.But China’s leaders have their own calculations, which prioritize stability decades from now over shareholder returns today. Chinese history is littered with dynasties that fell because of famines, floods or failures to adapt to new realities. 
从美国新自由主义经济学的观点来看，由国家主导的这种推动似乎是不正当的，甚至是不公平的。这种想法认为，政府凭借补贴和政治指令，做出了更适合由市场来做的决定。但中国领导人有自己的考量，他们更看重几十年后的稳定，而不是今天的股东回报。中国历史上因饥荒、洪水或未能适应新现实而覆灭的王朝比比皆是。

China received a frightening reminder of this in 2022, when vast areas of the country baked for weeks under a record heat wave that dried up rivers, withered crops and was blamed for several heatstroke deaths.China’s government knows that it must make this green transition out of rational self-interest or risk joining the Soviet Union on history’s scrap heap, and is actively positioning itself to do so. It is increasingly led by people with backgrounds in science, technology and environmental issues. 
中国在2022年收到了一个可怕的提醒——一场创纪录的热浪持续数周，使河流干涸、庄稼枯萎，并导致数人中暑死亡。中国政府知道，出于理性的自利，它必需进行绿色转型，否则就有可能和苏联一样，进入历史的垃圾堆，如今，它正在积极地做准备。越来越多具有科学、技术和环境问题背景的人士开始领导中国政府。

Much like how the United States showed up late for World War II, China’s clean-tech companies are latecomers, piggybacking on technology developed elsewhere. But history rewards not necessarily who was there first but who was there last — when a problem was solved.
就像美国在第二次世界大战中姗姗来迟一样，中国的清洁技术公司也是后来者，它们借用了其他地方开发的技术。但历史奖励的不一定是先到者，而是当问题得到解决时还在场的人。

Inside a canteen for seniors in downtown Shanghai, a worker brandishing a sponge inched closer to Maggie Xu, 29, as she was finishing her rice and garlic-and-oil-soaked broccoli. Ms. Xu ignored her.They also start to hover — like the auntie with the sponge — hurrying laggards out the door.The food is affordable and plentiful. The plates on offer, sometimes as cheap as $1.40, are crammed with local specialties like shredded eel with hot oil, steamed pork ribs or red braised pork belly.
上海市中心一家老年食堂里，29岁的玛吉·徐（音）马上就要吃完她的米饭和蒜茸西兰花了，清洁工手持海绵慢慢向她坐的地方擦过来。徐女士没有理会她。她们也会像那名清洁工那样，开始逼近那些来得晚的人，让他们快点离开。社区食堂的价格实惠，菜品丰富。有很多带有地方特色的菜，便宜的只要十块钱，如响油鳝丝、蒸排骨、红烧肉。

But instead of quelling the protests, Shafik’s decision appeared to backfire. By this week, she was besieged on all sides.Students protesters were unbowed, and soon the encampment had regrown to be even larger than before. Shafik’s own faculty threatened to revolt over an “unprecedented assault on student rights.” A least one major Jewish donor cut off support. And while the White House voiced deep concern, the very Republican lawmakers she had set out to appeal to called for her resignation.Shafik was now focused on “de-escalating the rancor” on campus.
然而沙菲克的决定不但没能平息抗议，似乎还产生了适得其反的效果。到了这一周，她已经四面楚歌。抗议学生不为所动，营地很快发展了到前所未有的规模。沙菲克的教员们威胁要起事，认为这是“对学生权利的一场空前的攻击”。至少有一名犹太大金主切断了资金支持。白宫表达了严正关切，然而那些她本想要努力迎合的共和党议员，却在呼吁她辞职。沙菲克现在把注意力放在“化解敌意”上。

Shafik defended free speech rights but said universities “cannot and should not tolerate abuse of this privilege.”Grudging Republicans largely accepted the answers.Organizers said they held hours of discussions with a senior university vice president to see if the two sides could find an off-ramp. The students were demanding the university divest from any financial interests enriching Israel and grant amnesty for all activists under investigation for protest actions, among other demands.
沙菲克为言论自由辩护，但表示，大学“不能也不应该容忍对这一特权的滥用”。心怀积怨的共和党人基本上接受了这些回答。组织者说，他们与大学的一位高级副校长进行了几个小时的讨论，看看双方是否能找到一个解决办法。学生们要求学校从任何有利于以色列的金融利益中撤资，并赦免所有因抗议活动而受到调查的活动人士，此外还有其他要求。

On the outskirts of Chongqing, western China’s largest city, sits a huge symbol of the country’s glut of car factories. It’s a complex of gray buildings, nearly a square mile in size. The thousands of employees who used to work there have moved on. Its crimson loading docks are closed.Dozens of gasoline-powered vehicle factories are barely running or have already been mothballed.The old internal combustion capacity is dying.
在中国西部最大城市重庆的郊区，坐落着中国汽车制造厂过剩的巨大象征。这是一个灰色建筑群，面积近250公顷。曾经在那里工作的数千名员工已经离开。深红色的装卸码头已经关闭。数十家以汽油为动力的汽车工厂要么勉强运转，要么已经停产。旧的内燃机产能正在消亡。

Within the United States, anti-China rhetoric is likely to intensify as the Democrats and Republicans compete to outdo each other on one of the few areas of bipartisan agreement.But both countries may also have little room for diplomatic maneuvering, because of hardening public opinion on both sides.There are already so many irritants and issues of mistrust within the relationship,If you have a pot which is already close to boiling, it only takes adding a degree or two to push things over the edge.
在美国国内，随着两党竞相对华强硬，反华言论可能会加剧，对华态度是两党意见一致的少数领域之一。但两国也许都没有多少外交上的回旋余地，因为双方的公众舆论都已趋于强硬。两国关系中已存在着很多刺激因素和不信任，就像一锅快烧开的水，只需再提高一两度就会沸腾起来。

The net result may be an Asia-Pacific region that is even more divided and dangerous than it is today, marked by a deepening arms race. In this increasingly contentious and militarized environment, the chance of some political incident or military accident triggering a devastating regional war is likely to grow. This is especially likely, given the absence of meaningful U.S. and allied crisis communication channels with China to prevent such an incident from spiraling out of control.
最终的结果可能是亚太地区比现在更加分裂和危险，军备竞赛日益加剧。在这种争议和军事化日益激烈的环境中，一些政治事件或军事意外引发毁灭性地区战争的可能性会增加。鉴于美国及其盟国与中国缺乏有效的危机沟通渠道来防止此类事件失控，这种情况尤其有可能发生。

For a start, the United States and key allies like Japan should make a sustained effort to establish a durable crisis prevention and management dialogue with China involving each nation’s foreign policy and security agencies.This process should include the establishment of an agreed-upon set of leaders’ best practices for crisis management and a trusted but unofficial channel through which the relevant parties can discuss crisis-averting understandings. 
首先，美国和日本等主要盟友应该做出持续努力，与中国建立持久的危机预防和管理对话，让各国的外交政策和安全机构都参与其中。这一进程应包括建立一套各方领导人一致认可的危机管理最佳做法，以及建立一个可信但非官方的渠道，通过该渠道，有关各方可以讨论避免危机的共识。

None of this will be easy, given the intense suspicion that now exists between Beijing and Washington and its allies. But new thinking and new diplomatic efforts could incentivize China to reciprocate in meaningful ways. At the very least, it’s necessary to try. Focusing on military deterrence alone won’t work. Trying to find a way to cooperate with China is the best way — perhaps the only way — to steer the world away from disaster.
鉴于北京与华盛顿及其盟友之间目前存在的强烈猜疑，这一切都不会是容易的事。但新的思维和新的外交努力可以激励中国以有意义的方式做出回应。说到底，试一试总是有必要的。仅仅关注军事威慑是行不通的。尝试找到一种与中国合作的方式，这是引导世界远离灾难的最佳途径——也许是唯一的途径。

To steer around opposition from right-wing Republicans in the House, Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, used a convoluted plan to pass it over the weekend.Military funding for Ukraine makes up the largest part of the package, totaling $60.8 billion.The bill closely mirrors the original Senate package, It prioritizes defensive capabilities, providing more than $5 billion to replenish the Iron Dome, David’s Sling and Iron Beam defense systems.
为了避开众议院右翼共和党人的反对，众议院议长、路易斯安那州共和党人迈克·约翰逊采用了迂回之道，于周末通过了这项法案。向乌克兰提供的军事资金占整个援助计划的大头，总额达到608亿美元。该法案与参议院最初的法案版本基本一致.该法案优先考虑以色列的防御能力，提供逾50亿美元用于补充“铁穹”、“大卫投石索”和“铁光束”等防御系统。

American allies, including France and Germany, have been skeptical about the viability of such a move under international law. They have instead been pushing for a solution that uses the proceeds on the interest from the nearly $300 billion of frozen Russian assets to give to Ukraine directly, either in the form of loans or as collateral to borrow money.
包括法国和德国在内的美国盟友一直对该举措在国际法下的可行性持怀疑态度。他们一直在推动一项解决方案，利用将近3000亿美元遭到冻结的俄罗斯资产的利息收入直接提供给乌克兰，可以是以贷款的形式或作为借款的担保。

the bill “was crafted in secret, rushed through the House and ultimately passed as part of a larger, must-pass bill exactly because it is a ban that Americans will find objectionable.”He added that it was “sadly ironic that Congress would pass a law trampling 170 million Americans’ right to free expression as part of a package they say is aimed at advancing freedom around the world.”
该法案“是秘密制定的，匆忙在众议院获得通过，并最终作为一项更大的、必须通过的法案的一部分获得通过，正是因为这是一项美国人会反对的禁令”。他补充说，“具有讽刺意味的是，国会通过一项践踏1.7亿美国人言论自由权的法律，而这是他们说的旨在促进世界各地自由的行动的一部分。”

Speaking to students at the N.Y.U.’s Shanghai campus later that morning, he said the educational exchanges the students were engaged in provided a “ballast” for a complicated and confrontational relationship.But the Biden administration has still been marching toward a more restrictive economic relationship with China.Mr. Biden emphasized that the United States would continue to take necessary actions to prevent advanced American technologies from being used to undermine its own national security, without unduly limiting trade and investment, according to the White House.But the moves have rankled Chinese leaders and pushed tensions over economic measures to their highest point in years.
当天上午晚些时候，他在纽约大学上海校区对学生们说，学生们参与的教育交流为复杂而充满对抗的关系提供了“压舱石”。但拜登政府仍在寻求更加严厉的对华经济关系。据白宫称，拜登强调，美国将继续采取必要行动，防止美国的先进技术被用来破坏自身国家安全，同时又不会过度限制贸易和投资。但这些举措激怒了中国领导人，并将围绕经济措施的紧张关系推至多年来的最高点。

The drones circled over the caves and crevices scattered around the mountain trails in northern Utah, feeding real-time video back to a search team on the ground looking for a missing hiker. Nineteen minutes later, they had her coordinates, bringing the rescue — a drill — closer to conclusion.
无人机在犹他州北部山路上散布的洞穴和裂缝上空盘旋，将实时视频传回给地面上寻找失踪徒步旅行者的搜救队。19分钟后，他们得到了她的坐标，这场救援（一场演习）也接近尾声。

The court said the trial’s fairness had been compromised by two key prosecution strategies: the use of Molineux witnesses and the prosecutors’ disclosure that if Mr. Weinstein took the stand in his own defense, they would ask him about dozens of allegations of other crimes and boorish, frightening behavior.Before the trial, during what is known as a Sandoval hearing, Justice Burke said he would let prosecutors question Mr. Weinstein about 28 allegations that included physically attacking his brother, threatening to cut off a colleague’s genitals with gardening shears, throwing a table of food, and screaming and cursing at hotel restaurant staff after they told him the kitchen was closed.“The threat of a cross-examination highlighting these untested allegations undermined defendant’s right to testify,” Judge Rivera wrote. “The remedy for these egregious errors is a new trial.”
法庭称，检方的两个关键策略破坏了审判的公正性：一是对莫里诺证人的使用，二是检方公开表示，如果韦恩斯坦出庭为自己辩护，他们会就他的其它数十项罪行指控和粗野、骇人的行径向他提问。在庭审前的一次所谓“桑多瓦尔听证”中，伯克大法官说他会允许检方就28项指控向韦恩斯特提问，其中包括对其弟的肢体袭击，威胁要用一把园艺剪剪掉一名同事的生殖器，在酒店餐馆工作人员告知厨房已经下班后，掀翻了一桌子的食物并对工作人员恶语相向。“威胁通过质证强调这些未经验证的陈词，损害了被告人出庭作证的权利，”里维拉写道。“对这些显著错误的纠正应该是一场新的审判。”

The three dissenting judges slammed the majority.Three judges — Madeline Singas, Anthony Cannataro and Michael J. Garcia — dissented in a pair of scathing opinions that accused the majority of continuing “a disturbing trend of overturning juries’ guilty verdicts in cases involving sexual violence.”The case clearly caused tension among the court, evident in a series of back-and-forth statements between the judges, with the majority defending itself against the dissenters’ claims that the ruling weakened the ability of accusers to push their cases through the criminal court system.
三位异议法官猛烈批评了多数意见。这三位法官——麦德琳·辛加斯、安瑟尼·坎纳塔罗和迈克尔·J·加西亚——用两份措辞严厉的意见书表达了异议，指责多数意见方延续了“在涉性暴力的案件中推翻陪审团有罪裁断的恼人趋势”。本案显然在法庭内造成了紧张的对立，这从法官陈词中的针锋相对就能看出来，多数意见方反驳了异议方的说法，认为该裁决并不会削弱提告者在刑事法庭系统内进行诉讼的能力。
