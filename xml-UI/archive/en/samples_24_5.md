In 1979 my mother pulled out a Band-Aid in a Nanjing hospital. The nurses clustered around it, amazed. “The West has everything!” they said.We were on a family visit to China, where my Shanghai relatives were similarly wowed by our excellent teeth and ample body fat, not to mention our descriptions of American dishwashers, refrigerators and air-conditioning. And with the general awe came V.I.P. treatment. Hosts broke out bottles of expensive orange soda that they freely mixed with expensive warm beer. We could not escape drinking this any more than we could escape our government-assigned “guide,” whose job was to strictly monitor visitors like us. Relatives or not, we were foreigners.
1979年，我母亲在南京的一家医院里拿出了一张创可贴。护士们围着它，赞叹不已。她们说：“西方什么都有！”我们当时正在中国探亲，我的上海亲戚们同样惊叹于我们的一口好牙和丰腴的身材，更不用说我们对美国洗碗机、冰箱和空调的描述了。伴随着人们普遍的敬畏，我们也受到了贵宾级的待遇。主人们拿出一瓶瓶昂贵的橘子汽水，随意与昂贵的温啤酒混合在一起。我们不能不喝，就像我们不能不接受政府指派的“向导”一样，他们的工作就是严格监控像我们这样的游客。不管是不是亲戚，我们都是外国人。

I returned to teach English at the Shandong Mining Institute in 1981. My students were coal mining engineers preparing to study abroad, so that they might bring back safer mining techniques. I was their “foreign expert.” As such, I had not only a sit-down toilet in the apartment provided to me, but also running hot water, an unheard-of luxury. My ayi, or housekeeper, would make a fire under a vat of water on the roof and, when it was ready, turn the faucet handle in my bathtub.
1981年，我再次回到中国，在山东矿业学院教英语。我的学生都是煤矿工程师，他们准备出国留学，希望带回更安全的采矿技术。我是他们的“外国专家”。因此，我的公寓里不仅有坐式马桶，还有自来水，这是闻所未闻的奢侈品。我的打扫阿姨会在屋顶上生火加热一大桶水，等水烧好了，就转开我浴缸里的水龙头把手。

Tesla has separately concluded a deal with one of China’s largest tech companies, Baidu, to obtain high-resolution maps of road lanes, according to a person familiar with the deal who was not authorized to speak about it publicly. Tesla cars in China have used Baidu maps for four years for basic navigation, directing drivers where to turn, but have not previously had access to the higher-resolution maps.
据一位未获授权公开谈论此事的知情人士透露，特斯拉已单独与中国最大的科技公司之一百度达成一项协议，以获得高分辨率的道路地图。中国的特斯拉汽车四年来一直使用百度地图进行基本导航，指导驾驶员该在何处转弯，但此前从未使用过更高分辨率的地图

In a din of firecrackers, cymbals and horns, a team of devotees carried the shrouded wooden statue of a serene-faced woman, holding her aloft on a brightly decorated litter as they navigated through tens of thousands of onlookers.Mazu, sometimes known as the Goddess of the Sea, is the most widely venerated of dozens of folk deities that many people in Taiwan turn to for solace, guidance and good fortune. The huge annual processions to honor her are noisy and gaudy. And yet for many, they are also deeply spiritual events, acts of faith showing that Mazu and other spirits remain vibrant presences here, alongside Buddhism and Christianity.
在一阵鞭炮、铙钹和喇叭声中，虔诚的信徒们抬着一尊面容安详的木制雕像，把她高高举起，放在装饰鲜艳的銮驾上，从成千上万的观众中走过。妈祖，有时也被称为海神娘娘，是台湾许多人寻求慰藉、指引和好运的几十个民间神灵中最受尊敬的一位。每年为纪念她而举行的盛大游行既喧闹又华丽。然而，对许多人来说，它们也是深刻的精神活动，这些虔诚的举动表明，像妈祖这样的神灵与佛教和基督教一样，在这里仍然充满活力。

But in flipping that decision, three appellate judges said Wednesday that the anthem was a “weapon” that could be used to undermine national security.“It has the effect of justifying and even romanticizing and glorifying the unlawful and violent acts inflicted on Hong Kong in the past few years, arousing and rekindling strong emotions and the desire to violent confrontations,” the court wrote.
但三名上诉法官周三推翻了这一裁决，称这首歌是可以用来破坏国家安全的“武器”。法院写道：“其作用是将过去几年在香港发生的非法暴力行为合理化，甚至浪漫化和美化，唤起并重新点燃强烈的情绪和暴力对抗的欲望。”

After a decade, the program has reeled in billions of euros in investments, but it has also helped fuel a wrenching housing crisis for its own citizens.“There’s nothing I can afford,” said Dr. Barba, an allergist who has been working 100 hours overtime every month to save up a nest egg. “If foreigners inflate the prices for those of us who live here, it’s an injustice,” she said.
推出十年来，该项目吸引了数十亿欧元的投资，但也助长了令本国居民感到痛苦的住房危机。“我什么都负担不起，”过敏症专科医生巴尔巴说，为了攒下积蓄，她每个月会加班100小时。“如果外国人抬高了我们这些住在这里的人要承担的价格，这是不公正的，”她说。

Half a dozen eurozone countries offered the visas at the height of Europe’s debt crisis in 2012 to help plug gaping budget deficits.The government in Lisbon is trying to fix the affordable housing problem with new rules that would require landlords to rent empty flats to families, capping rents and converting some commercial real estate to housing.many apartment and home listings around Athens and on breezy Greek islands suddenly shot up from bargain-basement prices to €250,000, well out of reach for most Greeks.
2012年，当欧洲债务危机最严重的时候，六个欧元区国家提供了这种签证，以帮助填补不断扩大的预算赤字。里斯本政府正试图通过新规定解决经济适用房问题，这些规定要求房东向家庭出租空置公寓，限制租金并将一些商业地产转变为住房。在雅典周边和微风吹拂的希腊岛屿上，许多公寓和房屋的价格突然从极低价位飙升至25万欧元，令大多数希腊人望尘莫及。

The pullback is coming as a broader housing crisis grips Europe, after years in which its real estate markets have undergone a profound metamorphosis that has increasingly pushed out modest-income workers, including doctors, teachers and police officers.
这一退出趋势正值欧洲面临更广泛的住房危机之时，欧洲房地产市场多年来经历了一场深刻的蜕变，日益将医生、教师和警察等中等收入工作者挤出市场。

Not only that, he has set up a task force to explore how to limit imports from countries that have high carbon footprints, a practice that he called “carbon dumping.” That was considered a veiled reference to China.In a world free from geopolitics, if China wanted to supply the world with cheap and plentiful clean energy inputs, from solar panels to critical minerals, it would benefit us all by enabling the fastest energy transition possible
不仅如此，他还成立了一个特别工作组，研究如何限制从碳足迹高的国家进口产品，他将这种做法称为“碳倾销”。这被视为在暗指中国。在一个不受地缘政治影响的世界里，如果中国想向世界提供廉价而丰富的清洁能源，从太阳能电池板到关键矿产，将使我们所有人都受益，因为能以最快的速度实现能源转型

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who believes that a personal touch is the key to diplomacy, lured President Xi Jinping of China to a 7,000-foot pass in the Pyrenees on Tuesday, expecting to show off the sweeping views that had stamped his childhood, but instead finding dense fog and wild snow flurries.Undeterred, but running two hours late, Mr. Macron greeted Mr. Xi under an umbrella at one of his favorite restaurants, L’Étape du Berger, or the Shepherd’s Stop, where dancers in colorful local dress twirled and jigged to the sounds of a flute, an accordion and a tom-tom.
法国总统马克龙相信个人化的色彩是外交的关键，周二，他把中国国家主席习近平引到比利牛斯山脉一个约2100米的山口，希望能展示童年记忆中的壮丽景色，结果却遭遇浓雾和大雪。马克龙虽然耽搁了两个小时，但并未受到影响，他撑着伞，在自己最喜欢的一家餐厅L’Étape du Berger（牧羊人小站）迎接习近平，穿着五颜六色当地服装的舞者随着长笛、手风琴和筒鼓的声音旋转起舞。

The Col du Tourmalet, where the leaders met, has mythical status in the Tour de France; its steep and winding ascent is a severe test. It is also a place dear to Mr. Macron, who regularly came here from his home in northern France to stay at the nearby house of his maternal grandmother, Germaine Nogues, the member of his family about whom he speaks most effusively.
二人会面的图尔马莱峰在环法自行车赛中有着神话般的地位；它陡峭而曲折的上坡路对于车手是一个严峻的考验。对马克龙来说，这里也是一个很亲切的地方，他经常从法国北部的家中来到这里，住在附近他的外祖母热尔梅娜·诺盖斯家的房子里。谈起外祖母，马克龙总是滔滔不绝。

Eric Abédie, the chef and a friend of Mr. Macron, offered a lunch of ham — cured for 24 months, from the black pigs of the region — shoulder of lamb, and blueberry tart. Cheeses and fine wines abounded. The ham, served as an aperitif, particularly impressed Mr. Xi, who said he would promote it back home. The atmosphere was festive, intimate and relaxed, as Mr. Macron wished.What exactly it would achieve was another matter.
马克龙的朋友、厨师埃里克·阿伯萨迪制作的午餐包括火腿——用该地区的黑猪腌制了24个月——羊肩肉和蓝莓馅饼。奶酪和美酒应有尽有。作为开胃菜的火腿给习近平留下了特别深刻的印象，他表示会在国内推广这款火腿。正如马克龙所希望的那样，现场气氛欢快、亲密、轻松。它究竟能取得什么样的成果则是另一回事了。

They did, however, note that the wine served was a Jean-Luc Colombo 2008 vintage, the year of the Beijing Olympics, and that its “robe rouge,” or red dress, recalled the name of a famous Chinese tea made in Fujian Province, which was once governed by Mr. Xi.Diplomacy is a subtle business, at least as practiced by the French.
然而，他们指出，午餐中提供的葡萄酒是2008年份的让-吕克·克伦伯，那是北京奥运会举行的年份，而它的“红袍”——也就是酒裙，则让人想起习近平曾经主政的福建出产的一种中国名茶。外交是一门微妙的学问，至少法国人的做法很微妙。
