In 1979 my mother pulled out a Band-Aid in a Nanjing hospital. The nurses clustered around it, amazed. “The West has everything!” they said.We were on a family visit to China, where my Shanghai relatives were similarly wowed by our excellent teeth and ample body fat, not to mention our descriptions of American dishwashers, refrigerators and air-conditioning. And with the general awe came V.I.P. treatment. Hosts broke out bottles of expensive orange soda that they freely mixed with expensive warm beer. We could not escape drinking this any more than we could escape our government-assigned “guide,” whose job was to strictly monitor visitors like us. Relatives or not, we were foreigners.
1979年，我母亲在南京的一家医院里拿出了一张创可贴。护士们围着它，赞叹不已。她们说：“西方什么都有！”我们当时正在中国探亲，我的上海亲戚们同样惊叹于我们的一口好牙和丰腴的身材，更不用说我们对美国洗碗机、冰箱和空调的描述了。伴随着人们普遍的敬畏，我们也受到了贵宾级的待遇。主人们拿出一瓶瓶昂贵的橘子汽水，随意与昂贵的温啤酒混合在一起。我们不能不喝，就像我们不能不接受政府指派的“向导”一样，他们的工作就是严格监控像我们这样的游客。不管是不是亲戚，我们都是外国人。

I returned to teach English at the Shandong Mining Institute in 1981. My students were coal mining engineers preparing to study abroad, so that they might bring back safer mining techniques. I was their “foreign expert.” As such, I had not only a sit-down toilet in the apartment provided to me, but also running hot water, an unheard-of luxury. My ayi, or housekeeper, would make a fire under a vat of water on the roof and, when it was ready, turn the faucet handle in my bathtub.
1981年，我再次回到中国，在山东矿业学院教英语。我的学生都是煤矿工程师，他们准备出国留学，希望带回更安全的采矿技术。我是他们的“外国专家”。因此，我的公寓里不仅有坐式马桶，还有自来水，这是闻所未闻的奢侈品。我的打扫阿姨会在屋顶上生火加热一大桶水，等水烧好了，就转开我浴缸里的水龙头把手。

Tesla has separately concluded a deal with one of China’s largest tech companies, Baidu, to obtain high-resolution maps of road lanes, according to a person familiar with the deal who was not authorized to speak about it publicly. Tesla cars in China have used Baidu maps for four years for basic navigation, directing drivers where to turn, but have not previously had access to the higher-resolution maps.
据一位未获授权公开谈论此事的知情人士透露，特斯拉已单独与中国最大的科技公司之一百度达成一项协议，以获得高分辨率的道路地图。中国的特斯拉汽车四年来一直使用百度地图进行基本导航，指导驾驶员该在何处转弯，但此前从未使用过更高分辨率的地图

In a din of firecrackers, cymbals and horns, a team of devotees carried the shrouded wooden statue of a serene-faced woman, holding her aloft on a brightly decorated litter as they navigated through tens of thousands of onlookers.Mazu, sometimes known as the Goddess of the Sea, is the most widely venerated of dozens of folk deities that many people in Taiwan turn to for solace, guidance and good fortune. The huge annual processions to honor her are noisy and gaudy. And yet for many, they are also deeply spiritual events, acts of faith showing that Mazu and other spirits remain vibrant presences here, alongside Buddhism and Christianity.
在一阵鞭炮、铙钹和喇叭声中，虔诚的信徒们抬着一尊面容安详的木制雕像，把她高高举起，放在装饰鲜艳的銮驾上，从成千上万的观众中走过。妈祖，有时也被称为海神娘娘，是台湾许多人寻求慰藉、指引和好运的几十个民间神灵中最受尊敬的一位。每年为纪念她而举行的盛大游行既喧闹又华丽。然而，对许多人来说，它们也是深刻的精神活动，这些虔诚的举动表明，像妈祖这样的神灵与佛教和基督教一样，在这里仍然充满活力。

But in flipping that decision, three appellate judges said Wednesday that the anthem was a “weapon” that could be used to undermine national security.“It has the effect of justifying and even romanticizing and glorifying the unlawful and violent acts inflicted on Hong Kong in the past few years, arousing and rekindling strong emotions and the desire to violent confrontations,” the court wrote.
但三名上诉法官周三推翻了这一裁决，称这首歌是可以用来破坏国家安全的“武器”。法院写道：“其作用是将过去几年在香港发生的非法暴力行为合理化，甚至浪漫化和美化，唤起并重新点燃强烈的情绪和暴力对抗的欲望。”

After a decade, the program has reeled in billions of euros in investments, but it has also helped fuel a wrenching housing crisis for its own citizens.“There’s nothing I can afford,” said Dr. Barba, an allergist who has been working 100 hours overtime every month to save up a nest egg. “If foreigners inflate the prices for those of us who live here, it’s an injustice,” she said.
推出十年来，该项目吸引了数十亿欧元的投资，但也助长了令本国居民感到痛苦的住房危机。“我什么都负担不起，”过敏症专科医生巴尔巴说，为了攒下积蓄，她每个月会加班100小时。“如果外国人抬高了我们这些住在这里的人要承担的价格，这是不公正的，”她说。

Half a dozen eurozone countries offered the visas at the height of Europe’s debt crisis in 2012 to help plug gaping budget deficits.The government in Lisbon is trying to fix the affordable housing problem with new rules that would require landlords to rent empty flats to families, capping rents and converting some commercial real estate to housing.many apartment and home listings around Athens and on breezy Greek islands suddenly shot up from bargain-basement prices to €250,000, well out of reach for most Greeks.
2012年，当欧洲债务危机最严重的时候，六个欧元区国家提供了这种签证，以帮助填补不断扩大的预算赤字。里斯本政府正试图通过新规定解决经济适用房问题，这些规定要求房东向家庭出租空置公寓，限制租金并将一些商业地产转变为住房。在雅典周边和微风吹拂的希腊岛屿上，许多公寓和房屋的价格突然从极低价位飙升至25万欧元，令大多数希腊人望尘莫及。

The pullback is coming as a broader housing crisis grips Europe, after years in which its real estate markets have undergone a profound metamorphosis that has increasingly pushed out modest-income workers, including doctors, teachers and police officers.
这一退出趋势正值欧洲面临更广泛的住房危机之时，欧洲房地产市场多年来经历了一场深刻的蜕变，日益将医生、教师和警察等中等收入工作者挤出市场。

Not only that, he has set up a task force to explore how to limit imports from countries that have high carbon footprints, a practice that he called “carbon dumping.” That was considered a veiled reference to China.In a world free from geopolitics, if China wanted to supply the world with cheap and plentiful clean energy inputs, from solar panels to critical minerals, it would benefit us all by enabling the fastest energy transition possible
不仅如此，他还成立了一个特别工作组，研究如何限制从碳足迹高的国家进口产品，他将这种做法称为“碳倾销”。这被视为在暗指中国。在一个不受地缘政治影响的世界里，如果中国想向世界提供廉价而丰富的清洁能源，从太阳能电池板到关键矿产，将使我们所有人都受益，因为能以最快的速度实现能源转型

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who believes that a personal touch is the key to diplomacy, lured President Xi Jinping of China to a 7,000-foot pass in the Pyrenees on Tuesday, expecting to show off the sweeping views that had stamped his childhood, but instead finding dense fog and wild snow flurries.Undeterred, but running two hours late, Mr. Macron greeted Mr. Xi under an umbrella at one of his favorite restaurants, L’Étape du Berger, or the Shepherd’s Stop, where dancers in colorful local dress twirled and jigged to the sounds of a flute, an accordion and a tom-tom.
法国总统马克龙相信个人化的色彩是外交的关键，周二，他把中国国家主席习近平引到比利牛斯山脉一个约2100米的山口，希望能展示童年记忆中的壮丽景色，结果却遭遇浓雾和大雪。马克龙虽然耽搁了两个小时，但并未受到影响，他撑着伞，在自己最喜欢的一家餐厅L’Étape du Berger（牧羊人小站）迎接习近平，穿着五颜六色当地服装的舞者随着长笛、手风琴和筒鼓的声音旋转起舞。

The Col du Tourmalet, where the leaders met, has mythical status in the Tour de France; its steep and winding ascent is a severe test. It is also a place dear to Mr. Macron, who regularly came here from his home in northern France to stay at the nearby house of his maternal grandmother, Germaine Nogues, the member of his family about whom he speaks most effusively.
二人会面的图尔马莱峰在环法自行车赛中有着神话般的地位；它陡峭而曲折的上坡路对于车手是一个严峻的考验。对马克龙来说，这里也是一个很亲切的地方，他经常从法国北部的家中来到这里，住在附近他的外祖母热尔梅娜·诺盖斯家的房子里。谈起外祖母，马克龙总是滔滔不绝。

Eric Abédie, the chef and a friend of Mr. Macron, offered a lunch of ham — cured for 24 months, from the black pigs of the region — shoulder of lamb, and blueberry tart. Cheeses and fine wines abounded. The ham, served as an aperitif, particularly impressed Mr. Xi, who said he would promote it back home. The atmosphere was festive, intimate and relaxed, as Mr. Macron wished.What exactly it would achieve was another matter.
马克龙的朋友、厨师埃里克·阿伯萨迪制作的午餐包括火腿——用该地区的黑猪腌制了24个月——羊肩肉和蓝莓馅饼。奶酪和美酒应有尽有。作为开胃菜的火腿给习近平留下了特别深刻的印象，他表示会在国内推广这款火腿。正如马克龙所希望的那样，现场气氛欢快、亲密、轻松。它究竟能取得什么样的成果则是另一回事了。

They did, however, note that the wine served was a Jean-Luc Colombo 2008 vintage, the year of the Beijing Olympics, and that its “robe rouge,” or red dress, recalled the name of a famous Chinese tea made in Fujian Province, which was once governed by Mr. Xi.Diplomacy is a subtle business, at least as practiced by the French.
然而，他们指出，午餐中提供的葡萄酒是2008年份的让-吕克·克伦伯，那是北京奥运会举行的年份，而它的“红袍”——也就是酒裙，则让人想起习近平曾经主政的福建出产的一种中国名茶。外交是一门微妙的学问，至少法国人的做法很微妙。

Train stations in these cities have become crowded, particularly during holidays like the recent five-day May Day break. Shanghai’s Hongqiao station, with a departure hall as long as three football fields, was still mobbed two days after the holiday ended.
这些城市的火车站变得拥挤不堪，尤其是在像最近的五一五天假期这样的节日期间。上海虹桥站的出发大厅有三个橄榄场那么长，在假期结束两天后仍然人头攒动。

The laws restricting ownership of cryptomining operations in Arkansas are intended to amend last year’s so-called Right to Mine law, which offered broad protections to the industry by limiting local regulation, and set off a fierce backlash among residents near the mines. One of those operations, with connections to the Chinese nationals, is the target of a lawsuit by residents who say the incessant whine from the thousands of fans cooling the computers has ruined their lives and depressed property values.
限制阿肯色州加密币采矿业务所有权的法律旨在修订去年所谓的“采矿权法”，该法通过限制地方监管，为该行业提供了广泛的保护，但在矿场附近的居民中引发了强烈反对。其中一家与中国公民有关系的公司，是当地居民提起诉讼的对象。他们说，数以千计为电脑降温的风扇发出持续不断的噪音，破坏了他们的生活，压低了房产价值。

Mr. Xi told President Emmanuel Macron of France that relations would be “as vibrant and thriving as springtime.” At his next stop, he said the “tree of China-Serbia friendship will grow tall and sturdy.” In Hungary, Mr. Xi told Prime Minister Viktor Orban that their countries were poised to “embark on a golden voyage.”“The two leaders sat gazing out the window at clouds rolling by,” the Xinhua report said. “They spoke at ease about their experiences growing up and thoughts on governance, and they reached many points of consensus.”
习近平对法国总统马克龙说，“中法关系必将如春天般充满生机、欣欣向荣。”在欧洲之行的第二站，他说，“让我们一起见证和期待中塞友谊之树茁壮成长。”在匈牙利，习近平对总理欧尔班说，两国关系已开始驶入“黄金航道”。“两国领导人临窗而坐，看窗外云卷云舒，”新华社的报道写道。他们“畅谈各自成长经历和治国理政感想，达成很多共识”。

After years of living in dorms and subpar apartments, Lisa Li could not wait to close on her new home.The one-bedroom condo in Miami’s financial district had a view of the river, was in a safe neighborhood and, Ms. Li heard, had neighbors who were much like her — less party, more chill. Then things took a sharp turn. At the last minute, the title company raised concerns about a small United States Coast Guard outpost near South Beach a few miles away.
在宿舍和差强人意的公寓住了多年后，丽莎·李（音）迫不及待地想要住进新家。这套一居室的河景公寓位于迈阿密的金融区，是一个安全的社区，丽莎·李听说，邻居们和她很像——不太喜欢派对，更喜欢放松。然后事情急转直下。物权凭证公司在最后关头提出一个担忧，因为离公寓楼几公里远的南海滩附近有一个美国海岸警卫队的小前哨

But he said categorical bans could further alienate a Chinese diaspora community that could be of particular help to the United States in the event of a conflict with China.We need to be careful about these blunt instrument laws, Nearly one year after her home-buying attempt fell through, Ms. Li, the renter in Miami, still vividly recalls the days spent frantically trying to salvage her deal.
但他表示，绝对的禁令可能会进一步疏远华人社区，如果与中国发生冲突的话，这个社区可能对美国特别有帮助。我们需要小心使用这些钝器法,购房失败近一年后，迈阿密的租房者李女士仍清楚地记得那些疯狂地试图挽救购房交易的日子。

The amygdala is a pair of neural clusters near the base of the brain that assesses danger and can help prompt a fight-or-flight response. A prolonged stress response may contribute to anxiety, which can cause people to perceive danger where there is none and obsess about worst-case scenarios.America’s collective national body is suffering from a chronic case of China anxiety. Mao Zedong once said that in an uncertain world, the Chinese must “Dig tunnels deep, store grain everywhere and never seek hegemony.” That sort of siege mentality is coming back.
杏仁核是靠近大脑底部的一对神经簇，负责评估危险，并有助于引发人们的“战或逃”反应。长时间的应激反应可能会导致焦虑，令人在没有危险的情况下认为有危险，总是在想着最坏的情况。美国的国家机体患上了慢性的中国焦虑征。毛泽东曾说过，在一个不确定的世界里，中国人必须“深挖洞、广积粮、不称霸”，如今，那种被围困的心态又回来了。

It’s not just that the world has in our lifetimes seen the greatest improvement in human wellness that we know of since the birth of our species. Despite some setbacks for democracy — and real risks here in the United States — I’ve learned to doubt despotism in the long run.
世界在我们有生之年见证的不只是自人类诞生以来人类健康的最大进步。虽然民主制度遭到一些挫折，而且在美国面临着真正的风险，但我已经学会了从长远上对专制主义持怀疑态度。

I couldn’t obtain a government pass to get through checkpoints, but I realized that U.N. workers were showing English-language credentials that the soldiers surely couldn’t read. So I put my United Airlines Mileage Plus card on a lanyard, drove up to a checkpoint and showed it — and the soldiers waved me through.Recklessness caught up with me, and eventually I was stopped at a checkpoint and kept in a detention hut decorated with a grisly mural of a prisoner being impaled by a stake through the stomach. It was a frightening wait as the soldiers summoned their commander. 
我弄不到检查站的政府通行证，但我发现联合国的工作人员出示的是英语证件，士兵们显然看不懂。于是我把美联航的航空里程卡挂在挂绳上，开车来到一处检查站，出示我的里程卡——士兵们挥手放行。出来混迟早要还，终于，我在一个检查站被拦下，关进了拘留室，里面有一幅可怕的壁画，画的是一个囚犯被木桩刺穿肚子。士兵去叫管事的，等待的过程令人恐惧。

Hans Rosling, a Swedish development expert, used to say that he wasn’t an optimist but a possibilist. In other words, he saw better outcomes as possible if we worked to achieve them. That makes sense to me, and it means replacing despair with guarded hope.This isn’t hope as a naïve faith that things will somehow end up OK. No, it is a somewhat battered hope that improvements are possible if we push hard enough.Mukhtar taught me that we humans are endowed with strength — and hope — that, if we recognize it and flex it, can achieve the impossible.
瑞典的发展专家汉斯·罗斯林曾经说过，他不是一个乐观主义者，而是一个可能性论者。换句话说，他认为只要我们足够努力，就有可能取得更好的结果。对我来说，这是有道理的，它意味着用谨慎的希望取代绝望。这种希望并非天真地相信一切都会好起来。不，它是一种有些受挫的希望，即如果我们足够努力，改善是可能的。穆赫塔尔告诉我，我们人类被赋予了力量与希望，如果我们认识到这一点，并运用它，就能实现不可能的目标。

None is forthcoming. Since 2020 and again in recent months, official Chinese voices have railed against a potential divestment. Government spokesmen have denounced the deal’s “robber’s logic.” nor does Beijing seem to mind an opportunity to jerk the leash of ByteDance, whose founder once issued a groveling apology for failing to uphold “socialist core values.”And as TikTok continues to operate, Mr. Biden himself hardly acts as if the app is menacing our national security. His re-election campaign persists in using TikTok to reach younger voters.
这种批准不会出现。自2020年以来，以及最近几个月，中国官方一直在抨击潜在的剥离。政府发言人谴责这笔交易是“强盗逻辑”。.似乎也不介意借机给字节跳动一点颜色看看，它的创始人曾经因为未坚守“社会主义核心价值观”而发表公开信，低声下气地道歉。随着TikTok的继续运营，拜登本人几乎没有表现出该应用程序正在威胁我国安全的样子。他的连任竞选活动坚持使用TikTok来吸引年轻选民。

The law to force a sale of TikTok will not address the failures of American tech giants who continue to profit from polarizing content. Taking down TikTok will remove some toxic posts, but do little to redress the harms to minors from Snap and Instagram. Impassioned controversies, from campus protests to the November election, travel extensively on other platforms as well, which have no lack of deceptive content from potential state actors.
强制出售TikTok的法律并不能解决美国科技巨头继续从两极分化的内容中获利的问题。关闭TikTok将除掉一些有毒的帖子，但对于解决Snap和Instagram给未成年人造成的伤害问题却几乎无济于事。从校园抗议到11月的大选，激烈的争议在其他平台上也广泛传播，这些平台上同样存在来自潜在国家行为者的欺骗性内容。

America is now committed to a long legal fight to ban TikTok. A potential defeat won’t look good, but victory may bear bitter fruit as well: the muddling of our values at home and a propaganda win for autocrats abroad.
为了禁止TikTok，美国现在正在打一场长期的法律战。万一失败肯定不好看，但胜利也可能结出苦果：在国内，我们的价值观被玷污，而在国外，专制者取得宣传的胜利。

Singapore was once known as an affluent and strait-laced city-state. Today, it’s a glitzy international destination. It has hosted Taylor Swift concerts and Formula One night races. And it is substantially richer, per capita, than the United States.Earlier this month, Mr. Lee gave his last major address to the nation at an icon of the new Singapore, the Marina Bay Sands casino resort.
新加坡曾作为依傍海峡的富有城邦为人所知，现在已经是一个华丽的国际旅游胜地。这里是泰勒·斯威夫特演唱会和一级方程式夜间赛的举办地。人均财富远远超过美国。本月早些时候，李显龙在新新加坡的标志——滨海湾金沙酒店向全国发表了他最后一次重要讲话。

Mr. Wong has tried to project an everyman image: He was raised in public housing, did not attend the same elite schools as his predecessors, and loves playing the guitar. Mr. Lee will stay on as “senior minister,” as his father did after stepping down in 1990. Mr. Lee has said that his children are not interested in entering politics.
黄循财一直努力塑造一个普通人的形象：他在公共住房中长大，没有上过与前任总理一样的名校，他喜欢弹吉他。李显龙将继续担任“国务资政”，就像他的父亲在1990年卸任后所做的那样。李显龙说过，他的子女对从政不感兴趣。

It transformed Singapore from a backwater swamp into a first-world nation and a key cog in global maritime trade.The city-state, a major financial hub, deftly managed the coronavirus pandemic and rising tensions between the United States and China.Mr. Choo said. “But I would argue that the opportunities for social mobility are far, far less.”In recent years, Mr. Lee had to contend with a public feud with his siblings and a series of scandals within the P.A.P. that sullied the squeaky-clean image the party projects. But he leaves office as a popular leader.
它把新加坡从一个落后的沼泽地变成了发达国家和全球海上贸易的重要枢纽。作为一个重要的金融中心，这个城市国家巧妙地应对了新冠大流行，以及美国和中国之间日益紧张的关系。周一雄说。“但我认为，社会流动性的机会要少得多。”近年来，李显龙不得不应对与兄弟姐妹之间的公开不和，以及人民行动党内部的一系列丑闻，这些丑闻玷污了该党打造的清廉形象。但他离任时仍是一位受欢迎的领导人。

The pomp and pageantry that greeted Mr. Putin in Beijing made clear the importance of that relationship and the leaders’ “no limits” strategic alignment. Mr. Xi welcomed Mr. Putin at the Great Hall of the People with a tightly choreographed ceremony featuring a 21-gun salute, a marching band, an honor guard and children jumping and waving in sync. The substance, the most important part, is hidden,It is the underwater part of the iceberg.
普京在北京受到的隆重接待清楚地表明了两国关系，以及两国领导人“无止境”战略联盟的重要性。习近平在人民大会堂外为普京举行了精心设计的欢迎仪式，包括21响礼炮、军乐队和仪仗队，以及同步挥手跳跃的儿童。最重要的实质部分被隐藏起来了，它是冰山的水下部分。

Chinese products, from electronics to cars, have filled the gap left by Western companies that quit the Russian market after the start of the war, allowing Mr. Putin to retain a semblance of consumer normalcy for his people despite Moscow’s isolation.The Russia leader lauded the two countries’ use of rubles and renminbi to settle trade to circumvent U.S. restrictions on using dollars.trade turnover between Russia and China is increasing at a good pace
俄乌战争爆发后，西方公司退出俄罗斯市场，而中国生产的产品——从电子设备到汽车，填补了西方产品走后留下的空白，让普京能在俄罗斯被孤立的情况下，为他的人民保留表面上的消费常态。俄罗斯领导人赞扬两国在贸易结算上使用卢布和人民币的做法，这样做规避了美国对使用美元的限制。俄罗斯和中国之间的贸易额仍在迅速增长

Russian forces opened a new line of attack in recent days near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Ukraine’s forces are stretched thin and running short on weapons, but billions of dollars’ worth of arms from the United States are expected to trickle in soon.
最近几天，俄罗斯军队在乌克兰第二大城市哈尔科夫附近展开了新的攻势。乌克兰的武装力量已经捉襟见肘，武器短缺，但美国价值数十亿美元的武器预计很快就会陆续运抵。

Vladimir Putin’s trip to Beijing this week, where he will meet with Xi Jinping and top Chinese officials, is another clear demonstration of the current closeness between Russia and China.Yet many in the West still want to believe that their alliance is an aberration, driven by Mr. Putin’s emotional anti-Americanism and his toxic fixation on Ukraine. These shifts are tectonic. Even in czarist times, Russia shipped its commodities to Europe and relied on imports from the West of manufactured goods. 
在本周的北京之行中，弗拉基米尔·普京将与习近平和中国高级官员会晤，再次明确展现俄中两国目前的亲密关系。然而，许多西方人还是愿意相信，他们之间的联盟不过是一种错乱，是普京情绪化的反美主义和他对乌克兰的不良执念所驱动的。这些变化是结构性的。即使在沙皇时代，俄罗斯也是将商品运往欧洲，并依赖从西方进口制成品。

In his dystopian novel “Day of the Oprichnik,” Vladimir Sorokin describes a deeply anti-Western Russia of 2028 that survives on Chinese technology while cosplaying the medieval brutality of Ivan the Terrible’s era. With every passing day, this unsettling and foresighted novel — published in 2006 as a warning to Russia about the direction of travel under Mr. Putin — reads more and more like the news.
弗拉基米尔·索罗金在他的反乌托邦小说《骑兵横行的日子》(Day of the Oprichnik)中描述了2028年一个极度反西方的俄罗斯，它依靠中国技术生存，同时又在上演“恐怖的伊凡”时代的中世纪暴行。随着一天天的过去，这部令人不安且富有远见的小说（出版于2006年，旨在警示俄罗斯在普京的领导下会走向何方）读起来越来越像新闻。

Mr. Putin’s tour of the institute was steeped in symbolism. The 103-year-old institution recently opened a joint campus with St. Petersburg State University, Mr. Putin’s alma mater. And in something of a snub to Washington, the school belongs on the United States’ so-called entity list, barring it from accessing American technology and taking part in educational exchanges because of its links to the People’s Liberation Army.
普京对哈工大的访问充满了象征意义。这所建校已103年的大学最近与普京的母校圣彼得堡国立大学一起设立了一个联合校区。而且，这在某种程度上是对华盛顿的一种冷落，因为该校由于跟中国人民解放军的关系，被美国列入所谓的实体名单，不得获取美国技术、参与美国的教育交流。

Russian forces are making advances around Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, seizing momentum before Ukrainian forces can be resupplied by billions of dollars in arms from the United States. Both Ukrainian and U.S. officials have warned of dire consequences if Ukrainian forces continue to be outmanned and outgunned.
俄罗斯军队正在向乌克兰第二大城市哈尔科夫推进，希望赶在乌克兰军队从美国获得数十亿美元的武器补给之前抢占先机。乌克兰和美国官员都警告，如果乌克兰军队继续在兵力和武器方面处于劣势，后果将不堪设想。

In a housing crisis that shows no end, the Chinese government is stepping in as a buyer of last resort.Chinese officials on Friday took their boldest step yet, unveiling a nationwide plan to buy up some of the vast housing stock languishing on the market. They also loosened rules for mortgages. The central bank said it would provide $41.5 billion in cheap loans to help state-owned enterprises buy housing built but not sold.Addressing officials on Friday, Mr. He said they had to “fight the tough battle” of dealing with all the unfinished property around the country, according to an official account from the Chinese state media outlet Xinhua.
在这场看不到尽头的房地产危机中，中国政府正以最后买家的身份介入。上周五，中国官员迈出了迄今为止最大胆的一步，公布了一项全国性计划，收购市场上大量闲置的部分住房。他们还放宽了抵押贷款的规定。中国央行表示，将提供3000亿元的低息贷款，帮助国有企业购买已建成但尚未出售的住房。据中国官方媒体新华社的官方报道，何立峰在周五对官员发表讲话时表示，必须打好“攻坚战”，处理全国各地所有未完工的房地产。

As it is in the United States, TikTok is popular in Taiwan, used by a quarter of the island’s 23 million residents.People post videos of themselves shopping for trendy clothes, dressing up as video game characters and playing pranks on their roommates. Influencers share their choreographed dances and debate whether the sticky rice dumplings are better in Taiwan’s north or south.
和在美国一样，TikTok在台湾很受欢迎，岛上2300万居民中有四分之一在使用它。人们发布自己购买时尚服装、打扮成游戏角色、捉弄室友的视频。网红们分享精心编排的舞蹈，讨论台湾北部和南部的粽子哪个更好吃。

“The old consensus has been blown apart, and a new one has not arisen,” said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who helped lead the pioneering research into what has come to be known as the China Shock of the early 2000s, when China’s acceptance into the World Trade Organization helped wipe out manufacturing jobs across the developed world.
“旧的共识被打破了，新的共识还没有形成，”麻省理工学院经济学家戴维·奥托说。他参与主持了对本世纪初所谓“中国冲击”的开创性研究，当时中国加入世界贸易组织，导致发达国家的制造业就业岗位大量流失。

But consumers and voters, Mr. Autor cautioned, “can’t have it both ways. You can make a trade-off. All the world is trade-offs. If you want to get to the point where the U.S. maintains and regains leadership in these technological areas, you’re going to have to pay more. And it’s not clear it’ll work.”“There’s a group of people who think that consumption is the end,” Mr. Lighthizer said. “And my view is production is the end, and safe and happy communities are the end. You should be willing to pay a price for that.”
但奥托警告说，消费者和选民“不可能两全其美”。“你要做出取舍。整个世界都在做取舍。如果你想让美国在这些技术领域保持并且重新获得领导地位，你就必须付出更多。即便这样也不见得一定能成。”“有些人认为消费就是目的，”莱特希泽说。“我的观点是，生产才是目的，安全和幸福的社区才是目的。你应该愿意为此付出代价。”

Welcome to a flourishing genre on Chinese social media: A.I.-manipulated videos that use young, purportedly Russian, women to rally support for China-Russia ties, stoke patriotic fervor or make money — and sometimes all three at once.“This representation of young white women in sexually objectified ways is a typical trope of gendered nationalism, or nationalistic sexism,” Professor Zhang wrote in an email. “Viewers can get both their nationalistic and masculine pride reaffirmed in consuming this content.”
欢迎观看这个中国社交媒体上风生水起的类型：以据称是俄罗斯年轻女性为主角的人工智能伪造视频，它们被用来争取对中俄关系的支持，激发爱国热情或是赚钱——有时三者兼而有之。“以性物化的方式呈现年轻白人女性是性别民族主义或民族主义性别歧视的典型表现，”张晨晨在一封电子邮件中写道。“观众可以在消费这些内容的过程中坚定自己的民族主义和男性自豪感。”

The levels of sophistication vary. Some of the fake women appear entirely computer generated, move stiffly and look like glorified Sims. Some, like those featuring Ms. Loiek’s likeness, are very good. He followed orders and expressed his deep remorse in a public apology. “I feel regretful because I have let down the guidance and expectations of the supervisory authorities all along,” he wrote.The path is narrowing, and the slope is getting steeper
这些视频的复杂程度各不相同。一些假女人看起来完全是电脑生成的，动作僵硬，也就比《模拟人生》游戏人物强些。有些则非常出色，比如以洛伊克为原型篡改的视频。他照办了，并在一份公开道歉中表示了自责和内疚。“自责是因为辜负了主管部门一直以来的指导和期待，”他写道。道路越来越窄，坡度越来越陡

Countless travelers have experienced the distinct anxiety-inducing sensation of turbulence on flights: Eyes squeezed shut, hands clamped to the armrests for dear life, bracing for the roller coaster to come.It can be intense and cause injuries during flights. 
无数旅客经历过飞机遭遇湍流时的焦虑：双眼紧闭，双手死死抓住扶手，准备迎接过山车的到来。湍流可能会很强烈，并在飞行中造成伤害。

“An investigation is ongoing into the death, which is currently being treated as unexplained,” the police said in a statement, adding that “a post-mortem will be conducted in due course.”
“目前正在对这起死因不明事件进行调查，”警方在声明中表示。警方还称，“将在适当的时候进行尸检。”

Wang Yi, China’s top foreign policy official, said this week: “The ugly acts of Lai Ching-te and others who betray the nation and their ancestors is disgraceful,” according to China’s Foreign Ministry. “All Taiwan independence separatists will be nailed to the pillar of shame in history.”
据中国外交部称，中国最高外交政策官员王毅本周表示，“赖清德之流背叛民族和祖先的丑行令人不齿”，“所有‘台独’分裂分子都将被钉在历史的耻辱柱上。”

The scale of China’s real estate boom was breathtaking. The extent of its unrelenting bust, which began nearly four years ago, remains vast and unclear.Few experts believe that Beijing can transition to more sustainable growth without confronting all those empty apartments and the developers that overextended to build them. All told, trillions of dollars are owed to builders, painters, real estate agents, small companies and banks around the country.
曾经，中国房地产繁荣的规模令人惊叹。近四年前持续萧条开始出现，其规模之大且具体情况仍不明晰。专家们普遍认为，若不解决所有这些空置公寓以及开发商过度扩张等问题，北京就无法过渡到更可持续的增长。全国各地的建筑商、油漆工、房地产中介、小公司和银行总共被拖欠了数万亿美元。

It was the first test of Beijing’s determination to wean China’s economy off its decades-long dependence on building and construction to sustain the economy.By the time a judge ordered the company to be liquidated five months ago, Evergrande had effectively ceased being a viable business.China’s top leaders are instead refocusing the lens to address the millions of apartments that no one wants to buy, pledging to turn them into social housing at lower rents. 
对于北京让中国经济摆脱几十年来对建筑和建造业依赖的决心，这是首次考验。到5个月前法官下令对恒大进行清算时，恒大实际上已不再是一家有生存能力的企业。相反，中国高层领导人正在重新调整视角，解决数以百万计无人想买的住房，承诺将这些住房改成租金更低的保障性住房。

Policymakers pulled other levers. They made their biggest cut ever to mortgage rates. They tried pilot programs to get residents to trade in old apartments and buy new ones. They even offered cheap loans to some cities to test out the idea of buying unsold apartments.The task, he added, was a daunting one that required “more patience when awaiting more draconian measures.”
政策制定者还动用了其他手段。他们对抵押贷款利率进行了有史以来最大幅度的下调。他们尝试了一些试点项目，让居民以旧换新。他们甚至向一些城市提供低息贷款，以测试购买未售出公寓的想法。他补充说，这是一项艰巨的任务，需要“在等待更严厉的措施时有更多耐心”。

But since Trump’s election in 2016, chastened Democratic policymakers have come to see green industrial policy as a kind of one-size-fits-all, policy-and-politics tool — a recipe for addressing the climate crisis, yes, but also for the postindustrial “secular stagnation” of the U.S. economy, for the domestic manufacturing decline, for white working-class resentment and for the geopolitical challenge posed by China.Trade protectionism is now perhaps the closest thing we have to a bipartisan consensus in Washington, but sometimes all those goals sit at cross purposes. 
但自从特朗普2016年当选总统以来，经历挫败后想有所改进的民主党政策制定者们已开始将绿色产业政策视为一种通用的政策和政治工具，它不仅是解决气候危机的办法，也是解决美国经济在后工业化时代“长期停滞”、国内制造业衰退、白人工人阶级不满，以及中国带来的地缘政治挑战等诸多问题的办法。贸易保护主义现在可能是我们在华盛顿看到的最接近两党共识的东西，但所有这些目标有时是相互矛盾的。

A few weeks ago, the electric-vehicle analyst Kevin Williams took a trip to Beijing to take the measure of the competition. Williams had gone to the city’s big annual automotive show to test one American perspective on China’s E.V. boom — that it was something between a state-sponsored boondoggle and a mirage of pointless overproduction.
几周前，电动汽车行业的分析师凯文·威廉姆斯为了摸清竞争对手的底细访问了北京。威廉姆斯参观了一年一度的北京车展，以验证一个美国对中国电动汽车行业繁荣的看法——这种看法曾介于那是国家支持的毫无意义的工作和无目标的过度生产幻象之间。

Mr. Musk has helped turn the pugnacious libertarian into one of the new faces of the modern right. But offline, he has used the relationship to press for benefits to his other businesses, the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX.Mr. Milei is part of a pattern by Mr. Musk of fostering relationships with a constellation of right-wing heads of state, with clear beneficiaries: his companies and himself.
马斯克帮助这位好斗的自由主义者变成了现代右翼的新招牌之一。但在线下，他利用这种关系为他的其他企业——电动汽车制造商特斯拉和火箭公司SpaceX——谋取利益 米莱是马斯克与一群右翼国家元首建立关系的一种模式的一部分，这种模式的受益者显然是他的公司和他自己。

“We know that the czarist regimes, for instance, kept tabs on Russian dissidents in Paris.”The Russian secret police even staged provocations in Paris to make dissidents seem dangerous and persuade French authorities to crack down on them. “The most notorious provocation occurred in Paris in 1890, when Arkadiy Harting (a.k.a. Abraham Gekel’man or Landezen) organized a well-armed team of bombthrowers and then betrayed them to the Paris police,” the C.I.A. historian Ben B. Fisher wrote in a 1996 analysis of the Paris operation.
“比如说，我们知道，沙皇政权密切关注身在巴黎的俄国异见人士。”沙俄的秘密警察甚至在巴黎挑事，令持不同政见者看起来很危险，并说服法国当局对他们进行镇压。“最臭名昭著的挑衅发生在1890年的巴黎，当时阿尔卡季·哈廷（又名亚伯拉罕·盖科尔曼或兰德岑）组建了一支装备精良的投弹手团队，然后向巴黎警方告发他们，”中央情报局的历史学家本·费舍尔在1996年对巴黎行动的分析中写道。

Ms. Shanahan, 38, a onetime Silicon Valley lawyer, has never held public office and has scant name recognition. But she was selected after Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Ventura fell through as vice-presidential candidates and Mr. Kennedy’s campaign needed money to fund its efforts to get onto state ballots, three people familiar with the events said. And money was something that Ms. Shanahan could provide in abundance.Status is very important to Nicole, and the amount of money you have.Her remark drew laughter from the crowd.
38岁的沙纳汉曾是硅谷律师，从未担任公职，知名度也很低。但据三位知情人士透露，她是在罗杰斯和文图拉落选副总统候选人后，肯尼迪的竞选团队为进入州选举而需要资金之时被选中的。资金是沙纳汉可以大量提供的东西。地位对妮可来说非常重要，还有就是你有多少钱.她的话令人群发出笑声。

Ms. Shanahan is “exactly the right person,” Mr. Kennedy said when he announced her as his running mate in March. He called her a “fierce warrior mom” who “overcame every daunting obstacle and went on to achieve the highest levels of the American dream.”On the campaign trail, Ms. Shanahan, who grew up in Oakland, Calif., has said she knew what it was like to be “one misfortune away from disaster. ”At a party in early 2021 in Miami, Ms. Shanahan was so intoxicated by drugs and alcohol that she required an IV infusion, the documents show.
沙纳汉“是最合适的人选”，肯尼迪在今年3月宣布她为竞选伙伴时说。他称她为“勇猛善战的母亲”，她“克服了所有令人生畏的障碍，最终实现了美国梦的最高境界”。竞选活动中，在加州奥克兰长大的沙纳汉曾表示，她知道“离灾难只有一步之遥的不幸”是什么感觉。文件显示，2021年初在迈阿密举行的一次派对上，沙纳汉因吸毒和酗酒导致严重的中毒反应，需要静脉输液。
