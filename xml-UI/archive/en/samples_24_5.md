In 1979 my mother pulled out a Band-Aid in a Nanjing hospital. The nurses clustered around it, amazed. “The West has everything!” they said.We were on a family visit to China, where my Shanghai relatives were similarly wowed by our excellent teeth and ample body fat, not to mention our descriptions of American dishwashers, refrigerators and air-conditioning. And with the general awe came V.I.P. treatment. Hosts broke out bottles of expensive orange soda that they freely mixed with expensive warm beer. We could not escape drinking this any more than we could escape our government-assigned “guide,” whose job was to strictly monitor visitors like us. Relatives or not, we were foreigners.
1979年，我母亲在南京的一家医院里拿出了一张创可贴。护士们围着它，赞叹不已。她们说：“西方什么都有！”我们当时正在中国探亲，我的上海亲戚们同样惊叹于我们的一口好牙和丰腴的身材，更不用说我们对美国洗碗机、冰箱和空调的描述了。伴随着人们普遍的敬畏，我们也受到了贵宾级的待遇。主人们拿出一瓶瓶昂贵的橘子汽水，随意与昂贵的温啤酒混合在一起。我们不能不喝，就像我们不能不接受政府指派的“向导”一样，他们的工作就是严格监控像我们这样的游客。不管是不是亲戚，我们都是外国人。

I returned to teach English at the Shandong Mining Institute in 1981. My students were coal mining engineers preparing to study abroad, so that they might bring back safer mining techniques. I was their “foreign expert.” As such, I had not only a sit-down toilet in the apartment provided to me, but also running hot water, an unheard-of luxury. My ayi, or housekeeper, would make a fire under a vat of water on the roof and, when it was ready, turn the faucet handle in my bathtub.
1981年，我再次回到中国，在山东矿业学院教英语。我的学生都是煤矿工程师，他们准备出国留学，希望带回更安全的采矿技术。我是他们的“外国专家”。因此，我的公寓里不仅有坐式马桶，还有自来水，这是闻所未闻的奢侈品。我的打扫阿姨会在屋顶上生火加热一大桶水，等水烧好了，就转开我浴缸里的水龙头把手。
