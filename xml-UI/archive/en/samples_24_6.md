But there was an ominous undertone when South Korea urged people not to touch the balloons and to report them to the authorities immediately. North Korea is known to hold large stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons, which its agents once used to assassinate Mr. Kim’s estranged half brother, Kim Jong-nam.
但当韩国呼吁人们不要触摸气球，一经发现立即向当局报告时，却带有一种不祥的暗示。众所周知，朝鲜拥有大量生物和化学武器，朝鲜特工曾用这些武器暗杀同金正恩关系疏远的同父异母兄长金正男。

Southern California appeared to be under siege from a blockade.More than 50 enormous vessels bobbed in the frigid waters of the Pacific Ocean, marooned off the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif. As days stretched into weeks, they waited their turn to pull up to the docks and disgorge their cargo. Rubberneckers flocked to the water’s edge with binoculars, trying to count the ships that stretched to the inky horizon.This was no act of war. This was what it looked like when the global economy came shuddering to a halt.
南加州看上去就像被封锁了。超过50艘巨轮在太平洋寒冷的海水中颠簸，被困在洛杉矶和加州长滩的两个港口附近。随着时间一天天过去，它们等待着轮到自己靠岸，卸下货物。看热闹的人拿着双筒望远镜蜂拥到水边，试图数清绵延至漆黑地平线的船到底有多少艘。这不是战争。这是全球经济陷入停滞时的情形。

It was October 2021, and the planet had been seized by the worst pandemic in a century. International commerce was rife with bewildering dysfunction. Basic geography itself seemed reconfigured, as if the oceans had stretched wider, adding to the distance separating the factories of China from the superstores of the United States.
那是在2021年10月，地球上发生了百年来最严重的大流行。国际贸易中到处都是令人困惑的失常。最基本的地理格局仿佛经过了重组，海洋被拉长，中国工厂与美国超市之间的距离变远。

Given the scale of container ships — the largest were longer than four times the height of the Statue of Liberty — any single vessel held at anchor indicated that enormous volumes of orders were not reaching their intended destinations. The decks of the ships were stacked to the skies with containers loaded with the components of contemporary life — from clothing and electronics to drums full of chemicals used to concoct other products like paint and pharmaceuticals.
鉴于集装箱船的规模——最大的集装箱船长度是自由女神像高度的四倍多——任何一艘停泊等待的集装箱船都意味着大量订单没有到达预定目的地。甲板上堆满了集装箱，里面的东西从服装和电子产品，到装满化学品（用于制造油漆和药品等产品）的桶，它们构成了当代生活的方方面面。

The trucking industry complained that it could not hire enough drivers to move this tsunami of product. Warehouses were stuffed to the rafters and short of workers. The railroads — hollowed out by years of corporate cost cutting — were buckling in the face of a surge of demand.For decades, the world had seemed compressed, the continents bridged by container ships, internet links and exuberant faith in globalization. Now, the earth again felt vast.
卡车运输业抱怨说，他们招不到足够多的司机来运送这些海啸般涌来的货物。仓库满满当当，却缺少工人。多年来由于企业削减成本而被掏空的铁路行业在需求激增的情况下陷入困境。几十年来，世界似乎被压缩了，各大洲被集装箱船、互联网和对全球化的狂热信仰连接起来。现在，人们重新感受到大地的辽阔。

The globalization to which we have become accustomed was propelled by an especially intoxicating form of efficiency, a concept known as Just in Time, or lean manufacturing.But the shortages of the pandemic have prompted some companies to recalibrate, building up inventories as they pivot from Just in Time to Just in Case.
我们已经习以为常的全球化是由一种特别令人陶醉的效率形式推动的，这种概念被称为及时制度(Just in Time)或精益制造。但疫情的短缺促使一些公司重新调整，在从“及时”转向“以防万一”的过程中增加库存。

At the end of the harrowing journey of the past four years lies one singular truth: Humanity has come to depend on a disorganized and rickety global supply chain for access to the products of our age, from lifesaving drugs and computer chips to toys and games. The system relies on myriad forms of labor exploitation, which has made it perpetually vulnerable to breakdown. And it has been constructed as a means of rewarding the investor class, often at the expense of reliability.
过去四年的艰辛历程告诉了我们一个真相：从拯救生命的药物和电脑芯片到玩具和电动游戏，人类依赖着一条混乱脆弱的全球供应链，以获取我们这个时代的产品。这个系统依赖于各种形式的劳动盘剥，这使得它永远面临着崩溃的可能性。它的建立是为了回报投资者群体，但往往以牺牲可靠性为代价。

Coalition politics are back — expect a game of musical chairs.India’s Wall Street twisted and turned.The blue-chip index lost about 6 percent, nearly wiping out its gains from the first five months of the year.This new era in Parliament is sure to begin with a few rounds of political retribution. Politicians who failed to deliver seats for their bosses will be shown the door. 
联盟政治又回来了，将会有一场抢椅子游戏。印度华尔街跌宕起伏.蓝筹股指数下跌了约6%，几乎抹平了今年前五个月的涨幅。议会的新时代必将以几轮政治报复开始。未能为他们的上司赢得席位的政治人士将被扫地出门。

They live in a parallel online universe. They know it and even joke about it.Now they are discovering that, beneath a facade bustling with short videos, livestreaming and e-commerce, their internet — and collective online memory — is disappearing in chunks.
他们生活在一个平行的网络世界里。他们知道这件事，甚至拿它来开玩笑。如今，他们发现，在短视频、直播和电子商务热闹的表象之下，他们的互联网——以及集体在线记忆——正在崩塌。

The government must thread a needle as it tries to address the collapse of an industry that accounts for a quarter of the Chinese economy. While discontent over the economy could shake social stability, so could a backlash by homeowners, many of whom are holding on to hope that their properties will build wealth for future generations.The government’s relaxation on price cuts addresses two protracted problems.
在解决占中国经济四分之一的房地产行业崩溃问题时，政府必须谨慎行事。虽然对经济的不满可能会动摇社会稳定，但房主的反弹同样如此，他们当中许多人都希望自己的房产能为子孙后代创造财富。政府对放宽降价限制解决了两个长期存在的问题。

But he has already declared that “radical change” is necessary. In his view, that means an enormous increase in joint spending, an overhaul of Europe’s higgledy-piggledy financing and regulations, and a consolidation of smaller companies.And without consolidating smaller companies, it cannot match the economies of scale available to mammoth foreign firms that are better positioned to gulp up market share and profits.
但他已经宣布，“彻底变革”是必要的。在他看来，这意味着大幅增加联合开支，彻底改革欧洲繁琐的融资和法规，以及整合小型公司。而且，如果不整合小公司，欧洲就无法与那些更有能力吞下市场份额和利润的巨型外国公司相比。

But they are wary of giving Brussels more control and financial muscle. And they are often reluctant to watch national brands merged with rivals or familiar business practices and administrative rules disappear. Creating a new morass of red tape is another worry.And some of the economic disparities with the United States are a result of choice. Half the gap in per-capita gross domestic product between Europe and the United States is a result of Europeans’ opting to work fewer hours, on average, over a lifetime.
但他们又不太愿意给予布鲁塞尔更多的控制权和财务力量。他们往往不希望看到本土品牌与竞争对手合并，或者熟悉的商业惯例和行政规则消失。另一个令人担忧的问题是繁文缛节造成的新混乱。与美国的一些经济差距是自愿的结果。欧洲和美国之间的人均国内生产总值差距，有一半是由于欧洲人选择在一生中平均工作更少的时间。

Angry farmers in France and Belgium blocked roadways and dumped truckloads of manure this year to protest the proliferation of E.U. environmental regulations that rule their use of pesticides and fertilizers, planting schedules, zoning and much more.
今年，愤怒的法国和比利时农民封锁了道路，倾倒大量粪便，以抗议欧盟环境法规的大量增加，这些法规规定了他们对农药和化肥的使用、种植时间表、区域划分等等。

“It’s between you and the higher-up,” said George K. Mullins, 99, a former staff sergeant in the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne, as he recalled the day he came ashore at Utah Beach with a folding carbine hooked to his belt and two K-rations. “We know there’s a spirit somewhere.”D-Day was not an end but a beginning. The Normandy campaign, zigzagging through the hedgerows that still divide fields today and teem in the sunlight with insect life, took a terrible toll.
99岁的乔治·K·穆林斯曾是第101空降师第327滑翔机步兵团的上士，在犹他海滩上岸的那一天，他的腰带上挂着一把折叠式卡宾枪和两份K口粮。“那是你和上苍之间的事，”他回忆起那天时说，“我们知道神灵就在某一个地方”。诺曼底登陆不是结束，而是开始。诺曼底战役造成了惨重的损失。士兵们曾在篱笆中曲折穿行，这些篱笆至今仍分割着田野，昆虫在阳光下繁衍生息。

History may not repeat itself but it does rhyme, as Mark Twain is said to have noted. In their youthful expressions, innocence and hope predominate. Roland Barthes, the French essayist, observed that in every old photograph lurks catastrophe.Certainly, with armed conflicts raging in Ukraine and Gaza, it needs no reminder of war’s perennial grip on humanity.
相传马克·吐温说过，历史也许不会重演，但它会押韵。他们年轻的脸庞充满天真和希望。而法国散文家罗兰·巴特指出，每张老照片中都潜藏着灾难。当然，在乌克兰和加沙武装冲突肆虐之际，战争如何长期笼罩着人类，也无需提醒。

Hatred gets the blood pumping in a way that reasoned compromise and civilized disagreement — foundations of any healthy society living in freedom under the rule of law — do not. Today, many politicians in Western societies do not hesitate to play on such emotions in attacking “the other.”“You realize that peace is never won for all time, it’s an eternal struggle to secure it,” he said. “We should unite to avoid war, but extreme parties are rising and represent the very contrary of what we are celebrating here.”
仇恨会让人热血沸腾，而理智的妥协和文明的分歧——任何在法治下自由生活的健康社会的基础——则不会。如今，西方社会的许多政客都毫不犹豫地利用这种情绪来攻击“他者”。“你要知道，和平永远不会一劳永逸，这是一场永恒的斗争，”他说。“我们应该团结起来避免战争，但极端政党正在崛起，他们所代表的东西与我们在这里庆祝的完全相反。”

The celebration has an extraordinary magnetism. The horrifying cratered landscape at the Pointe du Hoc, reminiscent of the still-pitted terrain of the Battle of Verdun in World War I, poses and reposes the question of how U.S. Rangers scaled that cliff. People flock to see it and wonder.
庆祝活动具有非凡的吸引力。奥克角可怕的弹坑景观让人想起第一次世界大战中的凡尔登战役，那里依然坑洼不平，同时也让人思考：美国陆军游骑兵是如何攀登这座悬崖的。人们蜂拥而至，对眼前的景象惊叹不已。

Converging from countless countries, they join in uniformed re-enactment groups. They careen around and among the hedgerows in jeeps, provoking endless traffic jams. They party and they dance and they come together on the vast wide sandy beaches in solemn contemplation of how Europe was saved from Hitler. Their children go to museums that recreate the terrain and the battle.
参观者来自无数国家，有人组成了穿制服的情景再现小组。他们开着吉普车在树篱间穿梭，引发严重的交通堵塞。他们狂欢、跳舞，聚集在广阔的沙滩上，沉思着欧洲是如何从希特勒手中被拯救出来。他们的孩子前往博物馆，那里重现了当年的地形和战争。

“It really hurt me to look at those skin-and-bone prisoners, and I knew that many were already dead,” Corporal Myers told me. “I’ve never forgotten it, but for 50 years I was silent because if I tried to talk about the war I would tear up and get embarrassed. Finally, I got the strength.”
“看着那些皮包骨头的囚犯，我真的很难过，我知道很多人已经死了，”迈尔斯告诉我。“我永远忘不了，但50年来我一直保持沉默，因为如果我想谈论那场战争，就会流泪并感到羞愧。最后，我终于鼓起了勇气。”

It has been hard to escape that feeling even in a festive Normandy, and I have found myself thinking of the last verse of Siegfried Sassoon’s “Suicide in the Trenches,” a poem of World War I: You smug-faced crowds with kindling eye Who cheer when soldier lads march by, Sneak home and pray you’ll never know The hell where youth and laughter go.
即使在欢庆的诺曼底也很难摆脱这种感觉，我想起西格夫里·萨松的《战壕中的自杀》(Suicide in the Trenches)的最后一节，这是一首关于第一次世界大战的诗：你们这些洋洋得意、眼神狂热的看客/士兵们列队经过，你们欢呼雀跃/然后溜回家里，祈祷永远不会知道/那青春和欢笑去了什么样的地方。

In India, a powerful leader wins another term but sees his party’s majority vanish. In South Africa, the governing party is humbled by voters for the first time since the end of apartheid. In Britain, a populist insurgent barges into an election that is shaping up to be a crushing defeat for the long-ruling Conservatives.If there is a common thread halfway through this global year of elections, it is a desire by voters to send a strong signal to the powers that be — if not quite a wholesale housecleaning, then a defiant shake-up of the status quo.
在印度，一位强大的领导人赢得了连任，但他所在政党在议会失去了多数席位。在南非，执政党自种族隔离制度结束以来第一次遭到选民的教训。在英国，一场民粹主义颠覆运动在选举中横冲直撞，而长期执政的保守党眼看要在这场选举中遭遇惨败。在这个全球选举年过半之际，如果说各国选举有什么共同点的话，那就是选民希望向当权者发出强烈信号——即使不是大清洗，至少也要对现状进行大举改革。

For years, populist and strongmen leaders have chipped away at democratic institutions, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of elections, while social media has swamped voters with disinformation and conspiracy theories.Yet now, Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan have both had their wings clipped. Soaring inflation, chronic unemployment and uneven economic growth have widened inequality in India, Turkey and elsewhere, frustrating voters who have shown a willingness to buck the establishment. They had been regarded as close to invincible, using appeals to nationalism or sectarianism to mobilize supporters and bending institutions to suit their purposes.
多年来，民粹主义和强人领导人削弱了民主制度，播下了对选举合法性的怀疑，而社交媒体则令选民被虚假信息和阴谋论淹没。然而现在，莫迪和埃尔多安双双折翼。通胀飙升、长期失业和不平衡的经济增长加剧了印度、土耳其和其他国家的不平等，引起那些不介意跟建制派翻脸的选民的不满。他们曾被视为近乎不可战胜，利用民族主义或宗派主义来动员支持者，并使制度屈从于自己的目的。

That will add to the headache for the Conservative Party, which has lagged the opposition Labour Party by double digits in polls for nearly 18 months. Reform, which is fielding candidates across the country, could siphon off Conservative votes among those who blame the party for a weak economy and rising immigration numbers since Britain left the European Union in 2020.More fundamentally, though, the Conservatives have been in power for 14 years, and they face the same pent-up dissatisfaction with the status quo that fueled the recent elections in India, South Africa and Turkey.
这将给保守党带来更多麻烦，该党在最近18个月的民调中均落后于反对党工党两位数。改革党在全国范围内提名候选人，可能会分流保守党的选票，这部分选民认为，英国于2020年脱欧后经济不景气、移民增多，该党难辞其咎。但从根本上说，保守党已经执政14年，他们面临着对现状压抑已久的不满情绪，而印度、南非和土耳其最近的选举也是如此。

South Africans flock to cities looking for work. But many end up in decrepit buildings and slapdash shack communities, often without running water or sanitary toilets. Regular power outages leave streets dark and residents of many communities vulnerable to crime.
南非人涌向城市寻找工作。但许多人最终住进了破旧的房屋和简陋的棚户区，往往没有自来水和卫生厕所。经常停电，街道一片黑暗，许多社区的居民易受犯罪的侵害。

As Americans gear up to greet pandas once again, we should remember that our infatuation with these animals requires a commitment to treating them with reverence and solicitude — because their presence improves us, and the planet, in ways that transcend the sheer joy of observing them.
当美国人再次准备迎接大熊猫时，我们应该记住，我们对这些动物的迷恋需要我们承诺以崇敬和关怀的态度去对待它们——因为它们的存在为我们和地球带来了好处，远不止观察它们所带来的纯粹欢乐。

As the great field biologist George Schaller wrote, these bears with a meat eater’s digestive system and the diet of a vegetarian are “as improbable as a carnivorous cow.” Unlike any other bear’s, their pupils are vertical, like a cat’s. And their method of mating in captivity seems anything but, well, productive. When they do conceive, their babies are born vulnerable and tiny, comparable in size to a stick of butter. (Case in point: One of the National Zoo’s most famous former resident pandas was nicknamed Butterstick.)
正如伟大的野外生物学家乔治·夏勒所写的那样，这种具有食肉动物消化系统和食草动物饮食习惯的熊类“就像食肉的牛一样不可思议”。与其他熊类不同的是，大熊猫的瞳孔是垂直的，就像猫一样。在圈养环境下，它们的交配方式似乎显得非常低效。就算能够怀孕，新生大熊猫也非常脆弱，个头很小，只有一根黄油棒那么大。（国家动物园以前最有名的一只常驻大熊猫绰号就叫黄油棒。）

“He was dashing, comfortable, even swashbuckling as a leader,” Paul Arnold, a violinist with the orchestra, said in the statement. “His playing was bold, expressive and hall-filling.” Mr. Carol “went on to personally embody the ‘Philadelphia Sound,’” he added.
“作为一名领导者，他潇洒、得体，甚至可以说雄姿英发，”乐团的小提琴手保罗·阿诺德在声明中说道。“他的演奏大胆、富有表现力、大气。”卡罗尔“后来成为了‘费城之音’的个人代表，”他补充道。

That fabled sound, which emerged under Leopold Stokowski and took shape under Ormandy, the orchestra’s longtime music director starting in the 1930s, is built on “distinctive honeyed timbre” emanating from its strings, as the journal Classical Voice North America noted in 2015, along with softer attacks from the brass section and a more blended percussion approach.
正如《北美古典之声》杂志在2015年所指出的，声名遐迩的费城之音滥觞于利奥波德·斯托科夫斯基任内，并在从20世纪30年代开始长期担任乐团音乐总监的奥曼迪的领导下逐渐形成的，它建立在弦乐部分所发出的“独特的蜜糖音色”上，同时铜管乐器的攻击更加柔和，打击乐器的演奏方法也更加融合。

By special request of Madame Mao, the Philadelphia Orchestra performed Beethoven’s Sixth Symphony, known as the Pastoral Symphony, a piece that dovetailed with the agrarian ideals of the revolution.Ormandy was not particularly fond of the symphony but relented, telling a colleague, “When in Rome, we should do as the Romans wish.”
应江青的特别要求，费城交响乐团演奏了贝多芬的《第六交响曲》，这部又名《田园交响曲》的作品与文革的农耕理想不谋而合。奥曼迪对这部作品并不是特别感冒，但最终还是同意了，他对一位同事说：“入乡随俗，就客随主便吧。”

Within hours of the verdict, President Biden traveled home, disembarked from Marine One and embraced his son. The president hugged Hunter Biden’s son and wife, as well, and bent over to kiss the head of his grandson, Beau Biden.To call the relationship between father and son battle tested is an understatement.
判决宣布仅几个小时后，拜登总统回到故乡，从海军陆战队一号上下来，拥抱了他的儿子。总统还拥抱了亨特·拜登的儿子和妻子，弯腰亲吻了孙子博·拜登的头。此情此景，仅仅说父子关系经受了考验是不够的。

People close to Mr. Biden say he still believes in his son and his ability to stay clean. Hunter Biden has maintained that he has been sober since 2019. 
He has also grown more resigned and worried than ever about what the future might hold for his son, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to relay private conversations.
与拜登关系密切的人士表示，拜登仍然相信儿子，相信他有能力不碰毒品。亨特·拜登则坚称自己自2019年以来一直保持戒毒戒酒的状态。他也变得比以往任何时候都更加听天由命，更担心儿子的未来，由于是私下里的谈话，前述相关人士都要求匿名。

Hunter Biden has faced serious legal problems for many years. Most recently he has relied on a wealthy benefactor, the Los Angeles lawyer Kevin Morris, to pay his multimillion-dollar back taxes bill and legal expenses. But as his legal problems continue, his cash crunch is only growing.
亨特·拜登多年来一直面临严重的法律问题。最近，他依靠富有的赞助人、洛杉矶律师凯文·莫里斯来支付数以百万计美元的补缴税款和法务费用。但随着他的法律问题继续，他的资金短缺只会越来越严重。

Since the beginning of the trial, Mr. Biden’s schedule has kept him physically away from the proceedings in Wilmington, Del. He honored World War II veterans in France and, shortly after the jury began deliberating on Monday, hosted a Juneteenth celebration at the White House. He is scheduled to leave for Italy on Wednesday to attend the Group of 7 summit.
自审判开始以来，拜登的日程安排使他无法亲临特拉华州威尔明顿的庭审。他在法国向“二战”老兵致敬，陪审团于周一开始审议后不久，他又在白宫主持解放黑奴纪念日庆祝活动。他还定于周三前往意大利参加七国集团峰会。

Now, those same shops have transformed into sleekly designed chains with in-store roti machines, mobile ordering apps and locations across the country — all aiming to serve the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States and the millions of others who now crave flavors like Shin Ramyun, chili crisp, chaat masala and chai.Miso, ghee, turmeric, soy sauce — their journeys to becoming widely available pantry staples all began with an Asian grocer.She lamented: When did the Indian grocery store get so corporate?
现在，这些商店已经变成了设计时尚的连锁店，店内设有印度烙饼机，开发了手机下单应用程序，门店遍布全美各地——所有这些都旨在服务于美国增长最快的族裔群体和数以百万计其他渴望辛拉面、辣酱、玛莎拉小食和印度奶茶等口味的人。味噌、酥油、姜黄、酱油——它们作为常备食品被广泛接受的过程，都是从一家亚洲杂货店开始的。她哀叹道：印度杂货店什么时候变得如此公司化了？

China decried the tariffs as lacking “factual and legal basis” that amounted to “weaponizing economic and trade issues,” said He Yadong, a spokesman for the commerce ministry.“This is not in line with the consensus reached by Chinese and European leaders on strengthening cooperation, and will affect the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade cooperation between China and Europe,”Tariffs for the other exporting companies will be based on the weighted average of the duty imposed on the three that were investigated.
中国商务部发言人何亚东表示，中国谴责这些关税缺乏“事实和法律依据”，等同于“将经贸问题武器化”。“这不符合中欧领导人就加强合作达成的共识，也会影响中欧双边经贸合作的氛围，”对其他出口公司征收的关税将基于对三家被调查公司征收关税的加权平均值。

He anticipated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and adroitly rallied NATO to stand up to it. In Asia, he shored up old alliances, built new ones and fanned China’s economic headwinds.Yet there is more to global leadership than backing friends and beating back foes. Leaders, in the full sense, don’t just remain on top; they solve problems and inspire confidence. Mr. Trump barely pretends to offer that kind of leadership on the world stage. But precisely because most U.S. officials do, it is all the more striking where American power stands today. The United States is not outmatched, exactly. But it is badly overstretched.
他预料到了俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，并巧妙地召集北约抗俄。在亚洲，他巩固了旧联盟，建立了新联盟，并削弱了中国的经济势头。然而，全球领导力不仅仅在于支持朋友和击退敌人。真正的领导者不仅能保持领先地位，还能解决问题、激发信心。向世界展示这样的领导力，特朗普连装都懒得装。然而恰恰因为大多数美国官员也是这样做的，美国今日的国力处境才格外令人震惊。说美国处于劣势倒还不至于。但的确是捉襟见肘了。

The Gaza war came at the worst possible time, and Mr. Biden responded to this calamity by plunging in. Having chosen to follow, not lead, Mr. Biden was left to tut-tut about Israel’s behavior from the self-imposed sidelines. In a defining conflict, the United States has managed to be weak and oppressive at once. 
加沙战争来得非常不是时候，拜登对这场灾难的回应是全力投入。拜登选择跟随而不是引领，只能在自我设定的旁观者位置上对以色列的行为表达不满。在一场决定性的冲突中，美国居然做到了既软弱又专横。

Despite the tough report on Microsoft’s security lapses, lawmakers at the hearing did not question Mr. Smith aggressively and instead focused on ways the government and private sector could work together.This is not a gotcha hearing, We urge stakeholders across industry, civil society and our international partners to work with us to eliminate the scourge of forced labor,
尽管有关微软安全漏洞的报告措辞严厉，但听证会上的议员们并没有对史密斯提出尖锐的质疑，而是把重点放在了政府和私营部门合作的方式上。这不是一场抓罪证的听证会.我们敦促整个行业的利益相关者、民间社会和我们的国际伙伴与我们合作，消除强迫劳动的苦难

The kind of lucrative endorsements enjoyed by foreign athletes are not usually given to Nepal’s ethnic Sherpas. For them, the profession of Himalayan guide offers a path out of deep poverty, but also a possible route — strewed with avalanches and icefalls — to a premature death.
尼泊尔的夏尔巴人通常得不到外国运动员享有的那种利润丰厚的代言合同。对他们来说，喜马拉雅向导的职业提供了一条摆脱极度贫困的道路，但也是一条到处都是雪崩和冰瀑，可能通往过早死亡的道路。

This is what a Sherpa does: He lugs heavy packs and oxygen cylinders for foreign clients. He cooks and sets up camp. He navigates through snowstorms and clears piles of trash. He wakes before dawn and spends hours driving metal pickets into the snow so a rope line can protect foreign climbers. He trudges past icefalls where bus-size slabs have buried other Sherpas in frozen graveyards. (On the mountain, he is usually a he; female Sherpas don’t tend to work as guides.)
夏尔巴人的工作如下：为外国客户搬运沉重的包裹和氧气瓶。做饭和搭帐篷。在暴风雪中穿行，清理成堆的垃圾。天不亮就起床，花几个小时在雪地上固定金属桩，拦出保护外国登山者的绳索。艰难地走过冰瀑，那些大巴车大小的板状冰体下，是夏尔巴人的坟场。(上山的夏尔巴人通常是男性；女性夏尔巴人一般不做向导。)

elevations above 26,000 feet, or 8,000 meters, where human cognition slows without supplemental oxygen and altitude sickness can quickly turn fatal.Yet their expertise earns them wages that, while high by local standards, are only a fraction of what most of their clients shell out for their expeditions.
海拔8000米以上的地方）能待的时间要长得多，在没有氧气补充的情况下，人类的认知会变迟钝，高原反应可能在短时间内导致死亡。

Mr. Lama lugged and hammered and pulled and hefted, making up for the missing half-dozen men. He was fast and efficient, with no unneeded movements in the thin air, Ms. Harila said.“Lama did all the jobs,” she said. “No one would have summited if Lama wasn’t there.”Whenever he could, after his exploits — 37 summits of the world’s tallest mountains by the time he died — Mr. Lama would return home to Walung, an isolated hamlet in northeastern Nepal. Walung sits in a high-altitude valley below barley and millet fields, where shaggy yaks graze, hunched against the cold. Mr. Lama and his brothers grew up herding livestock. They played soccer with a knot of worn socks serving as a ball.
“喇嘛”又拖又锤，又拉又扛，承担了那空缺的六人的工作。哈里拉说，他速度快，效率高，在稀薄的空气中没有任何不必要的动作。“‘喇嘛’做了所有的工作，”她说。“如果没有‘喇嘛’，没有人能登顶。”到“喇嘛”去世之前，他已经取得了登上了37座世界最高山峰的成就。一有时间，他就会回到瓦隆的家，那是尼泊尔东北部一个与世隔绝的小村庄，坐落在一个高海拔的山谷里，下面是大麦和谷田，毛茸茸的牦牛在田间吃草，弓着背抵御寒冷。“喇嘛”和兄弟们从小放牧牲畜。用破旧的袜子打结当足球踢。

Small scratches and dents are inevitable, but we have never had any major casualties,The government has not issued statistics on safety incidents involving driverless cars or advanced assisted-driving technologies, like automated lane changes and obstacle avoidance on highways. 
小刮小蹭在所难免，但没有出现过重大的人员伤亡事故。政府没有发布过涉及无人驾驶汽车或先进辅助驾驶技术的安全事故的统计数据，比如在高速公路上自动变道和躲避障碍物。

Over two days last month, I went for six rides in Baidu robot taxis in Wuhan. On one of the trips, with no safety driver ready to take over, the vehicle slowed nearly to a stop in fast-moving traffic on the upper deck of an expressway bridge high above the Yangtze River.It started beeping its horn automatically to yield the right of way, instead of accelerating to enter the adjacent lane. Both cars kept slowing until they were barely moving.A third car, moving at highway speed, whipped around both cars.
上个月的两天时间里，我在武汉乘坐了六次百度的机器人出租车。其中一次，没有配备安全驾驶员的自动驾驶出租车在一座长江大桥的上层公路桥快速行驶的车流中减速，几乎停了下来。它开始自动鸣笛以示礼让，而不是加速进入相邻车道。两辆车都在减速，直到它们几乎停下来。第三辆车以跑高速的速度绕过了我们这两辆车。

A spokeswoman said that the incident was an unusual circumstance and that drivers in Wuhan were seldom so willing to yield the right of way. She said the company would study the incident and consider whether to adjust the algorithms that control its driverless cars.Many drivers in Wuhan are indeed fairly aggressive. I saw a different robot taxi stop at a pedestrian crossing to allow people to walk across the street, only for motorists to blow their horns impatiently.
一名发言人表示，这起事件是一种不寻常的情况，武汉的司机很少如此愿意让路。她说，公司将研究这起事件，并会考虑是否调整控制无人驾驶汽车的算法。武汉的很多司机开车确实相当猛。我看到另一辆机器人出租车停在人行横道前，让行人过马路时，很多司机不耐烦地按起了喇叭。
