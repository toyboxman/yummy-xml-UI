But there was an ominous undertone when South Korea urged people not to touch the balloons and to report them to the authorities immediately. North Korea is known to hold large stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons, which its agents once used to assassinate Mr. Kim’s estranged half brother, Kim Jong-nam.
但当韩国呼吁人们不要触摸气球，一经发现立即向当局报告时，却带有一种不祥的暗示。众所周知，朝鲜拥有大量生物和化学武器，朝鲜特工曾用这些武器暗杀同金正恩关系疏远的同父异母兄长金正男。

Southern California appeared to be under siege from a blockade.More than 50 enormous vessels bobbed in the frigid waters of the Pacific Ocean, marooned off the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif. As days stretched into weeks, they waited their turn to pull up to the docks and disgorge their cargo. Rubberneckers flocked to the water’s edge with binoculars, trying to count the ships that stretched to the inky horizon.This was no act of war. This was what it looked like when the global economy came shuddering to a halt.
南加州看上去就像被封锁了。超过50艘巨轮在太平洋寒冷的海水中颠簸，被困在洛杉矶和加州长滩的两个港口附近。随着时间一天天过去，它们等待着轮到自己靠岸，卸下货物。看热闹的人拿着双筒望远镜蜂拥到水边，试图数清绵延至漆黑地平线的船到底有多少艘。这不是战争。这是全球经济陷入停滞时的情形。

It was October 2021, and the planet had been seized by the worst pandemic in a century. International commerce was rife with bewildering dysfunction. Basic geography itself seemed reconfigured, as if the oceans had stretched wider, adding to the distance separating the factories of China from the superstores of the United States.
那是在2021年10月，地球上发生了百年来最严重的大流行。国际贸易中到处都是令人困惑的失常。最基本的地理格局仿佛经过了重组，海洋被拉长，中国工厂与美国超市之间的距离变远。

Given the scale of container ships — the largest were longer than four times the height of the Statue of Liberty — any single vessel held at anchor indicated that enormous volumes of orders were not reaching their intended destinations. The decks of the ships were stacked to the skies with containers loaded with the components of contemporary life — from clothing and electronics to drums full of chemicals used to concoct other products like paint and pharmaceuticals.
鉴于集装箱船的规模——最大的集装箱船长度是自由女神像高度的四倍多——任何一艘停泊等待的集装箱船都意味着大量订单没有到达预定目的地。甲板上堆满了集装箱，里面的东西从服装和电子产品，到装满化学品（用于制造油漆和药品等产品）的桶，它们构成了当代生活的方方面面。

The trucking industry complained that it could not hire enough drivers to move this tsunami of product. Warehouses were stuffed to the rafters and short of workers. The railroads — hollowed out by years of corporate cost cutting — were buckling in the face of a surge of demand.For decades, the world had seemed compressed, the continents bridged by container ships, internet links and exuberant faith in globalization. Now, the earth again felt vast.
卡车运输业抱怨说，他们招不到足够多的司机来运送这些海啸般涌来的货物。仓库满满当当，却缺少工人。多年来由于企业削减成本而被掏空的铁路行业在需求激增的情况下陷入困境。几十年来，世界似乎被压缩了，各大洲被集装箱船、互联网和对全球化的狂热信仰连接起来。现在，人们重新感受到大地的辽阔。

The globalization to which we have become accustomed was propelled by an especially intoxicating form of efficiency, a concept known as Just in Time, or lean manufacturing.But the shortages of the pandemic have prompted some companies to recalibrate, building up inventories as they pivot from Just in Time to Just in Case.
我们已经习以为常的全球化是由一种特别令人陶醉的效率形式推动的，这种概念被称为及时制度(Just in Time)或精益制造。但疫情的短缺促使一些公司重新调整，在从“及时”转向“以防万一”的过程中增加库存。

At the end of the harrowing journey of the past four years lies one singular truth: Humanity has come to depend on a disorganized and rickety global supply chain for access to the products of our age, from lifesaving drugs and computer chips to toys and games. The system relies on myriad forms of labor exploitation, which has made it perpetually vulnerable to breakdown. And it has been constructed as a means of rewarding the investor class, often at the expense of reliability.
过去四年的艰辛历程告诉了我们一个真相：从拯救生命的药物和电脑芯片到玩具和电动游戏，人类依赖着一条混乱脆弱的全球供应链，以获取我们这个时代的产品。这个系统依赖于各种形式的劳动盘剥，这使得它永远面临着崩溃的可能性。它的建立是为了回报投资者群体，但往往以牺牲可靠性为代价。

Coalition politics are back — expect a game of musical chairs.India’s Wall Street twisted and turned.The blue-chip index lost about 6 percent, nearly wiping out its gains from the first five months of the year.This new era in Parliament is sure to begin with a few rounds of political retribution. Politicians who failed to deliver seats for their bosses will be shown the door. 
联盟政治又回来了，将会有一场抢椅子游戏。印度华尔街跌宕起伏.蓝筹股指数下跌了约6%，几乎抹平了今年前五个月的涨幅。议会的新时代必将以几轮政治报复开始。未能为他们的上司赢得席位的政治人士将被扫地出门。

They live in a parallel online universe. They know it and even joke about it.Now they are discovering that, beneath a facade bustling with short videos, livestreaming and e-commerce, their internet — and collective online memory — is disappearing in chunks.
他们生活在一个平行的网络世界里。他们知道这件事，甚至拿它来开玩笑。如今，他们发现，在短视频、直播和电子商务热闹的表象之下，他们的互联网——以及集体在线记忆——正在崩塌。

The government must thread a needle as it tries to address the collapse of an industry that accounts for a quarter of the Chinese economy. While discontent over the economy could shake social stability, so could a backlash by homeowners, many of whom are holding on to hope that their properties will build wealth for future generations.The government’s relaxation on price cuts addresses two protracted problems.
在解决占中国经济四分之一的房地产行业崩溃问题时，政府必须谨慎行事。虽然对经济的不满可能会动摇社会稳定，但房主的反弹同样如此，他们当中许多人都希望自己的房产能为子孙后代创造财富。政府对放宽降价限制解决了两个长期存在的问题。

But he has already declared that “radical change” is necessary. In his view, that means an enormous increase in joint spending, an overhaul of Europe’s higgledy-piggledy financing and regulations, and a consolidation of smaller companies.And without consolidating smaller companies, it cannot match the economies of scale available to mammoth foreign firms that are better positioned to gulp up market share and profits.
但他已经宣布，“彻底变革”是必要的。在他看来，这意味着大幅增加联合开支，彻底改革欧洲繁琐的融资和法规，以及整合小型公司。而且，如果不整合小公司，欧洲就无法与那些更有能力吞下市场份额和利润的巨型外国公司相比。

But they are wary of giving Brussels more control and financial muscle. And they are often reluctant to watch national brands merged with rivals or familiar business practices and administrative rules disappear. Creating a new morass of red tape is another worry.And some of the economic disparities with the United States are a result of choice. Half the gap in per-capita gross domestic product between Europe and the United States is a result of Europeans’ opting to work fewer hours, on average, over a lifetime.
但他们又不太愿意给予布鲁塞尔更多的控制权和财务力量。他们往往不希望看到本土品牌与竞争对手合并，或者熟悉的商业惯例和行政规则消失。另一个令人担忧的问题是繁文缛节造成的新混乱。与美国的一些经济差距是自愿的结果。欧洲和美国之间的人均国内生产总值差距，有一半是由于欧洲人选择在一生中平均工作更少的时间。

Angry farmers in France and Belgium blocked roadways and dumped truckloads of manure this year to protest the proliferation of E.U. environmental regulations that rule their use of pesticides and fertilizers, planting schedules, zoning and much more.
今年，愤怒的法国和比利时农民封锁了道路，倾倒大量粪便，以抗议欧盟环境法规的大量增加，这些法规规定了他们对农药和化肥的使用、种植时间表、区域划分等等。

“It’s between you and the higher-up,” said George K. Mullins, 99, a former staff sergeant in the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne, as he recalled the day he came ashore at Utah Beach with a folding carbine hooked to his belt and two K-rations. “We know there’s a spirit somewhere.”D-Day was not an end but a beginning. The Normandy campaign, zigzagging through the hedgerows that still divide fields today and teem in the sunlight with insect life, took a terrible toll.
99岁的乔治·K·穆林斯曾是第101空降师第327滑翔机步兵团的上士，在犹他海滩上岸的那一天，他的腰带上挂着一把折叠式卡宾枪和两份K口粮。“那是你和上苍之间的事，”他回忆起那天时说，“我们知道神灵就在某一个地方”。诺曼底登陆不是结束，而是开始。诺曼底战役造成了惨重的损失。士兵们曾在篱笆中曲折穿行，这些篱笆至今仍分割着田野，昆虫在阳光下繁衍生息。

History may not repeat itself but it does rhyme, as Mark Twain is said to have noted. In their youthful expressions, innocence and hope predominate. Roland Barthes, the French essayist, observed that in every old photograph lurks catastrophe.Certainly, with armed conflicts raging in Ukraine and Gaza, it needs no reminder of war’s perennial grip on humanity.
相传马克·吐温说过，历史也许不会重演，但它会押韵。他们年轻的脸庞充满天真和希望。而法国散文家罗兰·巴特指出，每张老照片中都潜藏着灾难。当然，在乌克兰和加沙武装冲突肆虐之际，战争如何长期笼罩着人类，也无需提醒。

Hatred gets the blood pumping in a way that reasoned compromise and civilized disagreement — foundations of any healthy society living in freedom under the rule of law — do not. Today, many politicians in Western societies do not hesitate to play on such emotions in attacking “the other.”“You realize that peace is never won for all time, it’s an eternal struggle to secure it,” he said. “We should unite to avoid war, but extreme parties are rising and represent the very contrary of what we are celebrating here.”
仇恨会让人热血沸腾，而理智的妥协和文明的分歧——任何在法治下自由生活的健康社会的基础——则不会。如今，西方社会的许多政客都毫不犹豫地利用这种情绪来攻击“他者”。“你要知道，和平永远不会一劳永逸，这是一场永恒的斗争，”他说。“我们应该团结起来避免战争，但极端政党正在崛起，他们所代表的东西与我们在这里庆祝的完全相反。”

The celebration has an extraordinary magnetism. The horrifying cratered landscape at the Pointe du Hoc, reminiscent of the still-pitted terrain of the Battle of Verdun in World War I, poses and reposes the question of how U.S. Rangers scaled that cliff. People flock to see it and wonder.
庆祝活动具有非凡的吸引力。奥克角可怕的弹坑景观让人想起第一次世界大战中的凡尔登战役，那里依然坑洼不平，同时也让人思考：美国陆军游骑兵是如何攀登这座悬崖的。人们蜂拥而至，对眼前的景象惊叹不已。

Converging from countless countries, they join in uniformed re-enactment groups. They careen around and among the hedgerows in jeeps, provoking endless traffic jams. They party and they dance and they come together on the vast wide sandy beaches in solemn contemplation of how Europe was saved from Hitler. Their children go to museums that recreate the terrain and the battle.
参观者来自无数国家，有人组成了穿制服的情景再现小组。他们开着吉普车在树篱间穿梭，引发严重的交通堵塞。他们狂欢、跳舞，聚集在广阔的沙滩上，沉思着欧洲是如何从希特勒手中被拯救出来。他们的孩子前往博物馆，那里重现了当年的地形和战争。

“It really hurt me to look at those skin-and-bone prisoners, and I knew that many were already dead,” Corporal Myers told me. “I’ve never forgotten it, but for 50 years I was silent because if I tried to talk about the war I would tear up and get embarrassed. Finally, I got the strength.”
“看着那些皮包骨头的囚犯，我真的很难过，我知道很多人已经死了，”迈尔斯告诉我。“我永远忘不了，但50年来我一直保持沉默，因为如果我想谈论那场战争，就会流泪并感到羞愧。最后，我终于鼓起了勇气。”

It has been hard to escape that feeling even in a festive Normandy, and I have found myself thinking of the last verse of Siegfried Sassoon’s “Suicide in the Trenches,” a poem of World War I: You smug-faced crowds with kindling eye Who cheer when soldier lads march by, Sneak home and pray you’ll never know The hell where youth and laughter go.
即使在欢庆的诺曼底也很难摆脱这种感觉，我想起西格夫里·萨松的《战壕中的自杀》(Suicide in the Trenches)的最后一节，这是一首关于第一次世界大战的诗：你们这些洋洋得意、眼神狂热的看客/士兵们列队经过，你们欢呼雀跃/然后溜回家里，祈祷永远不会知道/那青春和欢笑去了什么样的地方。

In India, a powerful leader wins another term but sees his party’s majority vanish. In South Africa, the governing party is humbled by voters for the first time since the end of apartheid. In Britain, a populist insurgent barges into an election that is shaping up to be a crushing defeat for the long-ruling Conservatives.If there is a common thread halfway through this global year of elections, it is a desire by voters to send a strong signal to the powers that be — if not quite a wholesale housecleaning, then a defiant shake-up of the status quo.
在印度，一位强大的领导人赢得了连任，但他所在政党在议会失去了多数席位。在南非，执政党自种族隔离制度结束以来第一次遭到选民的教训。在英国，一场民粹主义颠覆运动在选举中横冲直撞，而长期执政的保守党眼看要在这场选举中遭遇惨败。在这个全球选举年过半之际，如果说各国选举有什么共同点的话，那就是选民希望向当权者发出强烈信号——即使不是大清洗，至少也要对现状进行大举改革。

For years, populist and strongmen leaders have chipped away at democratic institutions, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of elections, while social media has swamped voters with disinformation and conspiracy theories.Yet now, Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan have both had their wings clipped. Soaring inflation, chronic unemployment and uneven economic growth have widened inequality in India, Turkey and elsewhere, frustrating voters who have shown a willingness to buck the establishment. They had been regarded as close to invincible, using appeals to nationalism or sectarianism to mobilize supporters and bending institutions to suit their purposes.
多年来，民粹主义和强人领导人削弱了民主制度，播下了对选举合法性的怀疑，而社交媒体则令选民被虚假信息和阴谋论淹没。然而现在，莫迪和埃尔多安双双折翼。通胀飙升、长期失业和不平衡的经济增长加剧了印度、土耳其和其他国家的不平等，引起那些不介意跟建制派翻脸的选民的不满。他们曾被视为近乎不可战胜，利用民族主义或宗派主义来动员支持者，并使制度屈从于自己的目的。

That will add to the headache for the Conservative Party, which has lagged the opposition Labour Party by double digits in polls for nearly 18 months. Reform, which is fielding candidates across the country, could siphon off Conservative votes among those who blame the party for a weak economy and rising immigration numbers since Britain left the European Union in 2020.More fundamentally, though, the Conservatives have been in power for 14 years, and they face the same pent-up dissatisfaction with the status quo that fueled the recent elections in India, South Africa and Turkey.
这将给保守党带来更多麻烦，该党在最近18个月的民调中均落后于反对党工党两位数。改革党在全国范围内提名候选人，可能会分流保守党的选票，这部分选民认为，英国于2020年脱欧后经济不景气、移民增多，该党难辞其咎。但从根本上说，保守党已经执政14年，他们面临着对现状压抑已久的不满情绪，而印度、南非和土耳其最近的选举也是如此。

South Africans flock to cities looking for work. But many end up in decrepit buildings and slapdash shack communities, often without running water or sanitary toilets. Regular power outages leave streets dark and residents of many communities vulnerable to crime.
南非人涌向城市寻找工作。但许多人最终住进了破旧的房屋和简陋的棚户区，往往没有自来水和卫生厕所。经常停电，街道一片黑暗，许多社区的居民易受犯罪的侵害。
