In New Delhi, where walking out of the house felt like walking into an oven, officials feared that the electricity grid was being overwhelmed and that the city’s water supply might need rationing.Scientists said this week that the average person on Earth had experienced 26 more days of abnormally high temperatures in the past year than would have been the case without human-induced climate change.
在新德里，走出家门就像走进烤箱，官员们担心电网不堪重负，城市供水可能需要定量配给。科学家本周表示，与没有人为气候变化的情况相比，过去一年地球上平均每人经历的异常高温天数增加了26天。

Losses are also mourned. Newborn panda cubs are about the size of a stick of butter, and they are extremely fragile — tiny and pink, they can be bruised easily by human handlers or by the mother. Since they are born nearly hairless, their body temperature must be constantly regulated. When they urinate or defecate, human helpers must make sure their fluid and nutrient levels are healthy.
去世也会受到哀悼。刚出生的熊猫幼崽只有一根黄油棒那么大，它们幼小粉嫩，非常脆弱，很容易被饲养员或熊猫妈妈弄伤。由于它们出生时几乎没有毛，因此必须不断调节体温。当它们排尿或排便时，人类助手必须确保它们的体液和营养水平是健康的。

Many owners of vacant investment apartments also find themselves facing years of hefty mortgage payments but little chance the apartments will appreciate significantly in value.China’s top leader, said that China’s policies were helping the world by increasing the global supply of goods and alleviating international inflation pressures.
许多空置的投资型公寓的业主发现，他们有要还很多年的大笔贷款，但公寓大幅升值的可能性却很小。中国最高领导人表示，中国丰富了全球商品供应，缓解了全球通胀压力

Mr. Xi has been wary of increases in social spending. “We still must not aim too high or go overboard with social security, and steer clear of the idleness-breeding trap of welfarism,” he said in a speech three years ago.
领导人对社会支出的增加始终持谨慎态度。他在三年前的一次讲话中提到：“不能提过高的目标，搞过头的保障，坚决防止落入‘福利主义’养懒汉的陷阱。”

For the I.M.F., trade squabbles between the West and China come at a particularly delicate time. The fund, which lends money at low interest rates to countries in fiscal distress, is supported financially by investments from member countries.
对IMF来说，西方和中国的贸易争端发生在一个特别微妙的时刻。IMF以低利率向陷入财政困境的国家提供贷款，其财政支持来自成员国的投资。

Like Google, Meta and Microsoft, OpenAI offers online chatbots and other A.I. tools that can write social media posts, generate photorealistic images and write computer programs. In its report, the company said its tools had been used in influence campaigns that researchers had tracked for years, including a Russian campaign called Doppelganger and a Chinese campaign called Spamouflage.
与谷歌、Meta和微软一样，OpenAI也提供在线聊天机器人和其他人工智能工具，这些工具可以撰写社交媒体帖子、生成逼真的图像和编写计算机程序。该公司在报告中表示，其工具已被用于研究人员追踪多年的影响力活动，包括被称为“二重身”的俄罗斯活动和被称为“垃圾邮件伪装”的中国活动。

Even before the trial’s opening statements, the Secret Service was in some measure planning for the extraordinary possibility of a former president’s incarceration. In the days before the trial began in April, prosecutors asked Justice Merchan to remind Mr. Trump that attacks on witnesses and jurors could land him in jail even before a verdict was rendered.
甚至在审判开始之前，特勤局就在某种程度上为前总统被监禁的特殊可能性做出了计划。在4月审判开始前几天，检察官要求默肯提醒特朗普，对证人和陪审员的攻击可能会让他在判决做出之前就入狱。

Steven Cheung, the communications director for Mr. Trump’s campaign, has said that the case against the former president was “so spurious and so weak” that other prosecutors had refused to bring it, and called it “an unprecedented partisan witch hunt.”That the Democrat fever dream of incarcerating the nominee of the Republican Party has reached this level exposes their Stalinist roots and displays their utter contempt for American democracy
特朗普竞选团队的通讯联络主管史蒂芬·张曾表示，针对前总统的指控“如此虚假，如此无力”，以至于其他检察官拒绝提起诉讼，并称这是“史无前例的党派政治迫害”。民主党把共和党提名人关进监狱的妄想已经达到了这种程度，这暴露了他们的斯大林主义根源，显示了他们对美国民主的彻底蔑视

If he were to be imprisoned, a detail of agents would work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, rotating in and out of the facility, several officials said. While firearms are strictly prohibited in prisons, the agents would, most likely, nonetheless be armed.
几名官员说，如果他被关进监狱，一组特工将每周七天、每天24小时轮班工作，轮流进出监狱。虽然枪支在监狱里是严格禁止的，但特工们很可能还是会携带武器。

The Republican and Democratic Parties have guaranteed spots on general-election ballots in every state, and the parties tell election officials whose name to put in their spot. States could, in theory, try to keep Mr. Trump off the ballot by passing legislation requiring a clean criminal record, but this would be on legally shaky ground.New York’s rules are somewhat more lenient: Felons there can vote while on parole or probation.
每个州的大选选票上都为共和党和民主党留有固定的位置，由两党告知选举官员在那个位置上写谁的名字。理论上各州可以通过立法要求候选人不得有犯罪记录，从而让特朗普不能上选票，不过这样做在法律上是不太站得住脚的。纽约州的规定相对宽大：重罪犯可以在假释或缓刑期间投票。

The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that states could not keep Mr. Trump off their ballots under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which disqualifies people who “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” after taking an oath to support the Constitution.In December, the Colorado Supreme Court found him ineligible, and Maine’s secretary of state did the same.But none of the crimes Mr. Trump is charged with carry that automatic penalty.
最高法院在3月全票裁决各州不能根据宪法第14修正案第3款阻止特朗普上选票，该法规定一个人在宣誓维护合众国宪法后如果存在“对合众国作乱或反叛”的行为，将被取消资格。12月，科罗拉多州最高法院裁决他不具备资格，缅因州州务卿做出了同样的决定。但特朗普被指控的罪名中，没有哪一项必然引致这样的惩罚。

The Justice Department does not indict sitting presidents, a policy outlined in a 1973 memo, during the Nixon era. It has never had reason to develop a policy on what to do with an incoming president who has already been indicted. But the rationale for not indicting sitting presidents — that it would interfere with their ability to perform their duties — applies just as well in this hypothetical scenario.
司法部不起诉在任总统，这是尼克松时代1973年一份备忘录中概述的政策。它从来没有理由去制定一项政策，来处理一位已经被公诉的即将上任的总统。但是，不起诉现任总统的理由——这会干扰总统履行职责的能力——同样适用于这种假设。

What would happen to the Georgia case, a state criminal proceeding beyond the reach of a Trump-run Justice Department, is a harder question still — one the country has never had reason to develop a road map for.In its Clinton v. Jones ruling in 1997, the court allowed a lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed. But that case was civil, not criminal, and it was filed by a private citizen, not by the government itself.
佐治亚州的案件是一项州刑事诉讼，超出了特朗普领导的司法部的管辖范围，这将是一个更难回答的问题——这个国家从来没有理由为这种情形制定方案。在1997年琼斯诉克林顿案的判决中，法院允许对比尔·克林顿总统的诉讼继续进行。但那是民事案，不是刑事案，而且是由一个普通公民提起，不是由政府本身提起的。

“To be prepared for war,” George Washington said, “is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.” President Ronald Reagan agreed with his forebear’s words, and peace through strength became a theme of his administration. Most Americans do not realize the specter of great power conflict has risen again.Then, they darken that already unsettling picture by explaining that our armed forces are at risk of being underequipped and outgunned. We struggle to build and maintain ships, our fighter jet fleet is dangerously small, and our military infrastructure is outdated. This whole endeavor would shake our status quo but be far less disruptive and expensive than the alternative.
乔治·华盛顿说过：“做好战争准备是维护和平的最有效手段之一。”罗纳德·里根总统赞同这位开国总统的说法，以实力求和平成为了里根政府的一个主题。大多数美国人都没有意识到，大国冲突的幽灵已经再现。然后他们解释说，我们的武装部队面临着装备不足和被超过的风险，这让原已令人不安的画面变得更加暗淡。我们在建造和维护军舰上困难重重，我们的战斗机数量少到了危险的程度，我们的军事基础设施已经过时。

This whole endeavor would shake our status quo but be far less disruptive and expensive than the alternative. Should China decide to wage war with the United States, the global economy could immediately fall into a depression. Our ability to deter our adversaries can be regained because we have done it before. At the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, in the twilight of the Soviet Union, George H.W. Bush reflected on the lessons of Pearl Harbor. Though the conflict was long gone, it taught him an enduring lesson: “When it comes to national defense,” he said, “finishing second means finishing last.”
所有这一切会动摇我们的现状，但这样做的破坏性和代价远低于其他选择。如果中国决定与美国打一仗的话，全球经济会马上陷入萧条。我们能重新获得威慑对手的能力，因为我们以前曾做到过这一点。在纪念珍珠港事件50周年之际，在苏联进入晚期的时候，乔治·H·W·布什反思了珍珠港事件的教训。虽然那场冲突早已过去，但他仍牢记着那个教训：“在国防问题上，位居第二就意味着位居最后，”他说。

I wrote a column recently lamenting the decline in marriage rates, noting that a record half of American adults are now unmarried. As a long-married romantic myself, steeped in statistics suggesting that marriage correlates with happiness, I found that sad.My readers, not so much.Many women readers in particular dismissed heterosexual marriage as an outdated institution that pampers men while turning women into unpaid servants.
我最近写了一篇痛惜婚姻率下降的专栏文章，指出有一半美国成年人现在处于未婚状态。我本人是结婚多年的浪漫主义者，知道很多认为婚姻与幸福有关联的统计数据，所以我对这种状态感到悲哀。我的读者们却不这么认为。尤其是许多女性读者，她们认为异性婚姻是一种过时的制度，它纵容男性，把女性变成无偿劳动的仆人。

Mr. Trump showed little emotion as the verdict was read, then shook his son Eric’s hand after being dismissed from the courtroom. Outside, he appeared somber as he repeated a litany of complaints about the case, including that the judge in the case, Juan M. Merchan, was biased against him.The former president sat largely expressionless, a glum look on his face, after the jury issued its verdict.
特朗普在宣读判决时没有表现出任何情绪，然后在离开法庭时与儿子埃里克握手。在法庭外，他面色阴郁，重复了一连串关于此案的抱怨，包括此案的法官胡安·默坎对他有偏见。陪审团宣布裁决后，这位前总统坐在那里，面无表情，脸色阴沉。

Dueling views of the case: A prosecutor from the Manhattan district attorney’s office said in closing arguments that Mr. Trump had tried to “hoodwink the American voter” with a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election. “All roads lead to the man who benefited the most: Donald Trump,” the prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, told the jury.
对案件的不同看法：曼哈顿地区检察官办公室的一名检察官在结案陈词中说，特朗普试图“蒙蔽美国选民”，阴谋影响2016年大选。“所有的道路都通向最大的受益者：唐纳德·特朗普，”约书亚·斯坦格拉斯检察官对陪审团说。
