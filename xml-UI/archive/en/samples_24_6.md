But there was an ominous undertone when South Korea urged people not to touch the balloons and to report them to the authorities immediately. North Korea is known to hold large stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons, which its agents once used to assassinate Mr. Kim’s estranged half brother, Kim Jong-nam.
但当韩国呼吁人们不要触摸气球，一经发现立即向当局报告时，却带有一种不祥的暗示。众所周知，朝鲜拥有大量生物和化学武器，朝鲜特工曾用这些武器暗杀同金正恩关系疏远的同父异母兄长金正男。

Southern California appeared to be under siege from a blockade.More than 50 enormous vessels bobbed in the frigid waters of the Pacific Ocean, marooned off the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif. As days stretched into weeks, they waited their turn to pull up to the docks and disgorge their cargo. Rubberneckers flocked to the water’s edge with binoculars, trying to count the ships that stretched to the inky horizon.This was no act of war. This was what it looked like when the global economy came shuddering to a halt.
南加州看上去就像被封锁了。超过50艘巨轮在太平洋寒冷的海水中颠簸，被困在洛杉矶和加州长滩的两个港口附近。随着时间一天天过去，它们等待着轮到自己靠岸，卸下货物。看热闹的人拿着双筒望远镜蜂拥到水边，试图数清绵延至漆黑地平线的船到底有多少艘。这不是战争。这是全球经济陷入停滞时的情形。

It was October 2021, and the planet had been seized by the worst pandemic in a century. International commerce was rife with bewildering dysfunction. Basic geography itself seemed reconfigured, as if the oceans had stretched wider, adding to the distance separating the factories of China from the superstores of the United States.
那是在2021年10月，地球上发生了百年来最严重的大流行。国际贸易中到处都是令人困惑的失常。最基本的地理格局仿佛经过了重组，海洋被拉长，中国工厂与美国超市之间的距离变远。

Given the scale of container ships — the largest were longer than four times the height of the Statue of Liberty — any single vessel held at anchor indicated that enormous volumes of orders were not reaching their intended destinations. The decks of the ships were stacked to the skies with containers loaded with the components of contemporary life — from clothing and electronics to drums full of chemicals used to concoct other products like paint and pharmaceuticals.
鉴于集装箱船的规模——最大的集装箱船长度是自由女神像高度的四倍多——任何一艘停泊等待的集装箱船都意味着大量订单没有到达预定目的地。甲板上堆满了集装箱，里面的东西从服装和电子产品，到装满化学品（用于制造油漆和药品等产品）的桶，它们构成了当代生活的方方面面。

The trucking industry complained that it could not hire enough drivers to move this tsunami of product. Warehouses were stuffed to the rafters and short of workers. The railroads — hollowed out by years of corporate cost cutting — were buckling in the face of a surge of demand.For decades, the world had seemed compressed, the continents bridged by container ships, internet links and exuberant faith in globalization. Now, the earth again felt vast.
卡车运输业抱怨说，他们招不到足够多的司机来运送这些海啸般涌来的货物。仓库满满当当，却缺少工人。多年来由于企业削减成本而被掏空的铁路行业在需求激增的情况下陷入困境。几十年来，世界似乎被压缩了，各大洲被集装箱船、互联网和对全球化的狂热信仰连接起来。现在，人们重新感受到大地的辽阔。

The globalization to which we have become accustomed was propelled by an especially intoxicating form of efficiency, a concept known as Just in Time, or lean manufacturing.But the shortages of the pandemic have prompted some companies to recalibrate, building up inventories as they pivot from Just in Time to Just in Case.
我们已经习以为常的全球化是由一种特别令人陶醉的效率形式推动的，这种概念被称为及时制度(Just in Time)或精益制造。但疫情的短缺促使一些公司重新调整，在从“及时”转向“以防万一”的过程中增加库存。

At the end of the harrowing journey of the past four years lies one singular truth: Humanity has come to depend on a disorganized and rickety global supply chain for access to the products of our age, from lifesaving drugs and computer chips to toys and games. The system relies on myriad forms of labor exploitation, which has made it perpetually vulnerable to breakdown. And it has been constructed as a means of rewarding the investor class, often at the expense of reliability.
过去四年的艰辛历程告诉了我们一个真相：从拯救生命的药物和电脑芯片到玩具和电动游戏，人类依赖着一条混乱脆弱的全球供应链，以获取我们这个时代的产品。这个系统依赖于各种形式的劳动盘剥，这使得它永远面临着崩溃的可能性。它的建立是为了回报投资者群体，但往往以牺牲可靠性为代价。

Coalition politics are back — expect a game of musical chairs.India’s Wall Street twisted and turned.The blue-chip index lost about 6 percent, nearly wiping out its gains from the first five months of the year.This new era in Parliament is sure to begin with a few rounds of political retribution. Politicians who failed to deliver seats for their bosses will be shown the door. 
联盟政治又回来了，将会有一场抢椅子游戏。印度华尔街跌宕起伏.蓝筹股指数下跌了约6%，几乎抹平了今年前五个月的涨幅。议会的新时代必将以几轮政治报复开始。未能为他们的上司赢得席位的政治人士将被扫地出门。

They live in a parallel online universe. They know it and even joke about it.Now they are discovering that, beneath a facade bustling with short videos, livestreaming and e-commerce, their internet — and collective online memory — is disappearing in chunks.
他们生活在一个平行的网络世界里。他们知道这件事，甚至拿它来开玩笑。如今，他们发现，在短视频、直播和电子商务热闹的表象之下，他们的互联网——以及集体在线记忆——正在崩塌。

The government must thread a needle as it tries to address the collapse of an industry that accounts for a quarter of the Chinese economy. While discontent over the economy could shake social stability, so could a backlash by homeowners, many of whom are holding on to hope that their properties will build wealth for future generations.The government’s relaxation on price cuts addresses two protracted problems.
在解决占中国经济四分之一的房地产行业崩溃问题时，政府必须谨慎行事。虽然对经济的不满可能会动摇社会稳定，但房主的反弹同样如此，他们当中许多人都希望自己的房产能为子孙后代创造财富。政府对放宽降价限制解决了两个长期存在的问题。

But he has already declared that “radical change” is necessary. In his view, that means an enormous increase in joint spending, an overhaul of Europe’s higgledy-piggledy financing and regulations, and a consolidation of smaller companies.And without consolidating smaller companies, it cannot match the economies of scale available to mammoth foreign firms that are better positioned to gulp up market share and profits.
但他已经宣布，“彻底变革”是必要的。在他看来，这意味着大幅增加联合开支，彻底改革欧洲繁琐的融资和法规，以及整合小型公司。而且，如果不整合小公司，欧洲就无法与那些更有能力吞下市场份额和利润的巨型外国公司相比。

But they are wary of giving Brussels more control and financial muscle. And they are often reluctant to watch national brands merged with rivals or familiar business practices and administrative rules disappear. Creating a new morass of red tape is another worry.And some of the economic disparities with the United States are a result of choice. Half the gap in per-capita gross domestic product between Europe and the United States is a result of Europeans’ opting to work fewer hours, on average, over a lifetime.
但他们又不太愿意给予布鲁塞尔更多的控制权和财务力量。他们往往不希望看到本土品牌与竞争对手合并，或者熟悉的商业惯例和行政规则消失。另一个令人担忧的问题是繁文缛节造成的新混乱。与美国的一些经济差距是自愿的结果。欧洲和美国之间的人均国内生产总值差距，有一半是由于欧洲人选择在一生中平均工作更少的时间。

Angry farmers in France and Belgium blocked roadways and dumped truckloads of manure this year to protest the proliferation of E.U. environmental regulations that rule their use of pesticides and fertilizers, planting schedules, zoning and much more.
今年，愤怒的法国和比利时农民封锁了道路，倾倒大量粪便，以抗议欧盟环境法规的大量增加，这些法规规定了他们对农药和化肥的使用、种植时间表、区域划分等等。

“It’s between you and the higher-up,” said George K. Mullins, 99, a former staff sergeant in the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne, as he recalled the day he came ashore at Utah Beach with a folding carbine hooked to his belt and two K-rations. “We know there’s a spirit somewhere.”D-Day was not an end but a beginning. The Normandy campaign, zigzagging through the hedgerows that still divide fields today and teem in the sunlight with insect life, took a terrible toll.
99岁的乔治·K·穆林斯曾是第101空降师第327滑翔机步兵团的上士，在犹他海滩上岸的那一天，他的腰带上挂着一把折叠式卡宾枪和两份K口粮。“那是你和上苍之间的事，”他回忆起那天时说，“我们知道神灵就在某一个地方”。诺曼底登陆不是结束，而是开始。诺曼底战役造成了惨重的损失。士兵们曾在篱笆中曲折穿行，这些篱笆至今仍分割着田野，昆虫在阳光下繁衍生息。

History may not repeat itself but it does rhyme, as Mark Twain is said to have noted. In their youthful expressions, innocence and hope predominate. Roland Barthes, the French essayist, observed that in every old photograph lurks catastrophe.Certainly, with armed conflicts raging in Ukraine and Gaza, it needs no reminder of war’s perennial grip on humanity.
相传马克·吐温说过，历史也许不会重演，但它会押韵。他们年轻的脸庞充满天真和希望。而法国散文家罗兰·巴特指出，每张老照片中都潜藏着灾难。当然，在乌克兰和加沙武装冲突肆虐之际，战争如何长期笼罩着人类，也无需提醒。

Hatred gets the blood pumping in a way that reasoned compromise and civilized disagreement — foundations of any healthy society living in freedom under the rule of law — do not. Today, many politicians in Western societies do not hesitate to play on such emotions in attacking “the other.”“You realize that peace is never won for all time, it’s an eternal struggle to secure it,” he said. “We should unite to avoid war, but extreme parties are rising and represent the very contrary of what we are celebrating here.”
仇恨会让人热血沸腾，而理智的妥协和文明的分歧——任何在法治下自由生活的健康社会的基础——则不会。如今，西方社会的许多政客都毫不犹豫地利用这种情绪来攻击“他者”。“你要知道，和平永远不会一劳永逸，这是一场永恒的斗争，”他说。“我们应该团结起来避免战争，但极端政党正在崛起，他们所代表的东西与我们在这里庆祝的完全相反。”

The celebration has an extraordinary magnetism. The horrifying cratered landscape at the Pointe du Hoc, reminiscent of the still-pitted terrain of the Battle of Verdun in World War I, poses and reposes the question of how U.S. Rangers scaled that cliff. People flock to see it and wonder.
庆祝活动具有非凡的吸引力。奥克角可怕的弹坑景观让人想起第一次世界大战中的凡尔登战役，那里依然坑洼不平，同时也让人思考：美国陆军游骑兵是如何攀登这座悬崖的。人们蜂拥而至，对眼前的景象惊叹不已。

Converging from countless countries, they join in uniformed re-enactment groups. They careen around and among the hedgerows in jeeps, provoking endless traffic jams. They party and they dance and they come together on the vast wide sandy beaches in solemn contemplation of how Europe was saved from Hitler. Their children go to museums that recreate the terrain and the battle.
参观者来自无数国家，有人组成了穿制服的情景再现小组。他们开着吉普车在树篱间穿梭，引发严重的交通堵塞。他们狂欢、跳舞，聚集在广阔的沙滩上，沉思着欧洲是如何从希特勒手中被拯救出来。他们的孩子前往博物馆，那里重现了当年的地形和战争。

“It really hurt me to look at those skin-and-bone prisoners, and I knew that many were already dead,” Corporal Myers told me. “I’ve never forgotten it, but for 50 years I was silent because if I tried to talk about the war I would tear up and get embarrassed. Finally, I got the strength.”
“看着那些皮包骨头的囚犯，我真的很难过，我知道很多人已经死了，”迈尔斯告诉我。“我永远忘不了，但50年来我一直保持沉默，因为如果我想谈论那场战争，就会流泪并感到羞愧。最后，我终于鼓起了勇气。”

It has been hard to escape that feeling even in a festive Normandy, and I have found myself thinking of the last verse of Siegfried Sassoon’s “Suicide in the Trenches,” a poem of World War I: You smug-faced crowds with kindling eye Who cheer when soldier lads march by, Sneak home and pray you’ll never know The hell where youth and laughter go.
即使在欢庆的诺曼底也很难摆脱这种感觉，我想起西格夫里·萨松的《战壕中的自杀》(Suicide in the Trenches)的最后一节，这是一首关于第一次世界大战的诗：你们这些洋洋得意、眼神狂热的看客/士兵们列队经过，你们欢呼雀跃/然后溜回家里，祈祷永远不会知道/那青春和欢笑去了什么样的地方。

In India, a powerful leader wins another term but sees his party’s majority vanish. In South Africa, the governing party is humbled by voters for the first time since the end of apartheid. In Britain, a populist insurgent barges into an election that is shaping up to be a crushing defeat for the long-ruling Conservatives.If there is a common thread halfway through this global year of elections, it is a desire by voters to send a strong signal to the powers that be — if not quite a wholesale housecleaning, then a defiant shake-up of the status quo.
在印度，一位强大的领导人赢得了连任，但他所在政党在议会失去了多数席位。在南非，执政党自种族隔离制度结束以来第一次遭到选民的教训。在英国，一场民粹主义颠覆运动在选举中横冲直撞，而长期执政的保守党眼看要在这场选举中遭遇惨败。在这个全球选举年过半之际，如果说各国选举有什么共同点的话，那就是选民希望向当权者发出强烈信号——即使不是大清洗，至少也要对现状进行大举改革。

For years, populist and strongmen leaders have chipped away at democratic institutions, sowing doubts about the legitimacy of elections, while social media has swamped voters with disinformation and conspiracy theories.Yet now, Mr. Modi and Mr. Erdogan have both had their wings clipped. Soaring inflation, chronic unemployment and uneven economic growth have widened inequality in India, Turkey and elsewhere, frustrating voters who have shown a willingness to buck the establishment. They had been regarded as close to invincible, using appeals to nationalism or sectarianism to mobilize supporters and bending institutions to suit their purposes.
多年来，民粹主义和强人领导人削弱了民主制度，播下了对选举合法性的怀疑，而社交媒体则令选民被虚假信息和阴谋论淹没。然而现在，莫迪和埃尔多安双双折翼。通胀飙升、长期失业和不平衡的经济增长加剧了印度、土耳其和其他国家的不平等，引起那些不介意跟建制派翻脸的选民的不满。他们曾被视为近乎不可战胜，利用民族主义或宗派主义来动员支持者，并使制度屈从于自己的目的。

That will add to the headache for the Conservative Party, which has lagged the opposition Labour Party by double digits in polls for nearly 18 months. Reform, which is fielding candidates across the country, could siphon off Conservative votes among those who blame the party for a weak economy and rising immigration numbers since Britain left the European Union in 2020.More fundamentally, though, the Conservatives have been in power for 14 years, and they face the same pent-up dissatisfaction with the status quo that fueled the recent elections in India, South Africa and Turkey.
这将给保守党带来更多麻烦，该党在最近18个月的民调中均落后于反对党工党两位数。改革党在全国范围内提名候选人，可能会分流保守党的选票，这部分选民认为，英国于2020年脱欧后经济不景气、移民增多，该党难辞其咎。但从根本上说，保守党已经执政14年，他们面临着对现状压抑已久的不满情绪，而印度、南非和土耳其最近的选举也是如此。

South Africans flock to cities looking for work. But many end up in decrepit buildings and slapdash shack communities, often without running water or sanitary toilets. Regular power outages leave streets dark and residents of many communities vulnerable to crime.
南非人涌向城市寻找工作。但许多人最终住进了破旧的房屋和简陋的棚户区，往往没有自来水和卫生厕所。经常停电，街道一片黑暗，许多社区的居民易受犯罪的侵害。

As Americans gear up to greet pandas once again, we should remember that our infatuation with these animals requires a commitment to treating them with reverence and solicitude — because their presence improves us, and the planet, in ways that transcend the sheer joy of observing them.
当美国人再次准备迎接大熊猫时，我们应该记住，我们对这些动物的迷恋需要我们承诺以崇敬和关怀的态度去对待它们——因为它们的存在为我们和地球带来了好处，远不止观察它们所带来的纯粹欢乐。

As the great field biologist George Schaller wrote, these bears with a meat eater’s digestive system and the diet of a vegetarian are “as improbable as a carnivorous cow.” Unlike any other bear’s, their pupils are vertical, like a cat’s. And their method of mating in captivity seems anything but, well, productive. When they do conceive, their babies are born vulnerable and tiny, comparable in size to a stick of butter. (Case in point: One of the National Zoo’s most famous former resident pandas was nicknamed Butterstick.)
正如伟大的野外生物学家乔治·夏勒所写的那样，这种具有食肉动物消化系统和食草动物饮食习惯的熊类“就像食肉的牛一样不可思议”。与其他熊类不同的是，大熊猫的瞳孔是垂直的，就像猫一样。在圈养环境下，它们的交配方式似乎显得非常低效。就算能够怀孕，新生大熊猫也非常脆弱，个头很小，只有一根黄油棒那么大。（国家动物园以前最有名的一只常驻大熊猫绰号就叫黄油棒。）

“He was dashing, comfortable, even swashbuckling as a leader,” Paul Arnold, a violinist with the orchestra, said in the statement. “His playing was bold, expressive and hall-filling.” Mr. Carol “went on to personally embody the ‘Philadelphia Sound,’” he added.
“作为一名领导者，他潇洒、得体，甚至可以说雄姿英发，”乐团的小提琴手保罗·阿诺德在声明中说道。“他的演奏大胆、富有表现力、大气。”卡罗尔“后来成为了‘费城之音’的个人代表，”他补充道。

That fabled sound, which emerged under Leopold Stokowski and took shape under Ormandy, the orchestra’s longtime music director starting in the 1930s, is built on “distinctive honeyed timbre” emanating from its strings, as the journal Classical Voice North America noted in 2015, along with softer attacks from the brass section and a more blended percussion approach.
正如《北美古典之声》杂志在2015年所指出的，声名遐迩的费城之音滥觞于利奥波德·斯托科夫斯基任内，并在从20世纪30年代开始长期担任乐团音乐总监的奥曼迪的领导下逐渐形成的，它建立在弦乐部分所发出的“独特的蜜糖音色”上，同时铜管乐器的攻击更加柔和，打击乐器的演奏方法也更加融合。

By special request of Madame Mao, the Philadelphia Orchestra performed Beethoven’s Sixth Symphony, known as the Pastoral Symphony, a piece that dovetailed with the agrarian ideals of the revolution.Ormandy was not particularly fond of the symphony but relented, telling a colleague, “When in Rome, we should do as the Romans wish.”
应江青的特别要求，费城交响乐团演奏了贝多芬的《第六交响曲》，这部又名《田园交响曲》的作品与文革的农耕理想不谋而合。奥曼迪对这部作品并不是特别感冒，但最终还是同意了，他对一位同事说：“入乡随俗，就客随主便吧。”

Within hours of the verdict, President Biden traveled home, disembarked from Marine One and embraced his son. The president hugged Hunter Biden’s son and wife, as well, and bent over to kiss the head of his grandson, Beau Biden.To call the relationship between father and son battle tested is an understatement.
判决宣布仅几个小时后，拜登总统回到故乡，从海军陆战队一号上下来，拥抱了他的儿子。总统还拥抱了亨特·拜登的儿子和妻子，弯腰亲吻了孙子博·拜登的头。此情此景，仅仅说父子关系经受了考验是不够的。

People close to Mr. Biden say he still believes in his son and his ability to stay clean. Hunter Biden has maintained that he has been sober since 2019. 
He has also grown more resigned and worried than ever about what the future might hold for his son, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to relay private conversations.
与拜登关系密切的人士表示，拜登仍然相信儿子，相信他有能力不碰毒品。亨特·拜登则坚称自己自2019年以来一直保持戒毒戒酒的状态。他也变得比以往任何时候都更加听天由命，更担心儿子的未来，由于是私下里的谈话，前述相关人士都要求匿名。

Hunter Biden has faced serious legal problems for many years. Most recently he has relied on a wealthy benefactor, the Los Angeles lawyer Kevin Morris, to pay his multimillion-dollar back taxes bill and legal expenses. But as his legal problems continue, his cash crunch is only growing.
亨特·拜登多年来一直面临严重的法律问题。最近，他依靠富有的赞助人、洛杉矶律师凯文·莫里斯来支付数以百万计美元的补缴税款和法务费用。但随着他的法律问题继续，他的资金短缺只会越来越严重。

Since the beginning of the trial, Mr. Biden’s schedule has kept him physically away from the proceedings in Wilmington, Del. He honored World War II veterans in France and, shortly after the jury began deliberating on Monday, hosted a Juneteenth celebration at the White House. He is scheduled to leave for Italy on Wednesday to attend the Group of 7 summit.
自审判开始以来，拜登的日程安排使他无法亲临特拉华州威尔明顿的庭审。他在法国向“二战”老兵致敬，陪审团于周一开始审议后不久，他又在白宫主持解放黑奴纪念日庆祝活动。他还定于周三前往意大利参加七国集团峰会。

Now, those same shops have transformed into sleekly designed chains with in-store roti machines, mobile ordering apps and locations across the country — all aiming to serve the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States and the millions of others who now crave flavors like Shin Ramyun, chili crisp, chaat masala and chai.Miso, ghee, turmeric, soy sauce — their journeys to becoming widely available pantry staples all began with an Asian grocer.She lamented: When did the Indian grocery store get so corporate?
现在，这些商店已经变成了设计时尚的连锁店，店内设有印度烙饼机，开发了手机下单应用程序，门店遍布全美各地——所有这些都旨在服务于美国增长最快的族裔群体和数以百万计其他渴望辛拉面、辣酱、玛莎拉小食和印度奶茶等口味的人。味噌、酥油、姜黄、酱油——它们作为常备食品被广泛接受的过程，都是从一家亚洲杂货店开始的。她哀叹道：印度杂货店什么时候变得如此公司化了？

China decried the tariffs as lacking “factual and legal basis” that amounted to “weaponizing economic and trade issues,” said He Yadong, a spokesman for the commerce ministry.“This is not in line with the consensus reached by Chinese and European leaders on strengthening cooperation, and will affect the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade cooperation between China and Europe,”Tariffs for the other exporting companies will be based on the weighted average of the duty imposed on the three that were investigated.
中国商务部发言人何亚东表示，中国谴责这些关税缺乏“事实和法律依据”，等同于“将经贸问题武器化”。“这不符合中欧领导人就加强合作达成的共识，也会影响中欧双边经贸合作的氛围，”对其他出口公司征收的关税将基于对三家被调查公司征收关税的加权平均值。

He anticipated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and adroitly rallied NATO to stand up to it. In Asia, he shored up old alliances, built new ones and fanned China’s economic headwinds.Yet there is more to global leadership than backing friends and beating back foes. Leaders, in the full sense, don’t just remain on top; they solve problems and inspire confidence. Mr. Trump barely pretends to offer that kind of leadership on the world stage. But precisely because most U.S. officials do, it is all the more striking where American power stands today. The United States is not outmatched, exactly. But it is badly overstretched.
他预料到了俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，并巧妙地召集北约抗俄。在亚洲，他巩固了旧联盟，建立了新联盟，并削弱了中国的经济势头。然而，全球领导力不仅仅在于支持朋友和击退敌人。真正的领导者不仅能保持领先地位，还能解决问题、激发信心。向世界展示这样的领导力，特朗普连装都懒得装。然而恰恰因为大多数美国官员也是这样做的，美国今日的国力处境才格外令人震惊。说美国处于劣势倒还不至于。但的确是捉襟见肘了。

The Gaza war came at the worst possible time, and Mr. Biden responded to this calamity by plunging in. Having chosen to follow, not lead, Mr. Biden was left to tut-tut about Israel’s behavior from the self-imposed sidelines. In a defining conflict, the United States has managed to be weak and oppressive at once. 
加沙战争来得非常不是时候，拜登对这场灾难的回应是全力投入。拜登选择跟随而不是引领，只能在自我设定的旁观者位置上对以色列的行为表达不满。在一场决定性的冲突中，美国居然做到了既软弱又专横。

Despite the tough report on Microsoft’s security lapses, lawmakers at the hearing did not question Mr. Smith aggressively and instead focused on ways the government and private sector could work together.This is not a gotcha hearing, We urge stakeholders across industry, civil society and our international partners to work with us to eliminate the scourge of forced labor,
尽管有关微软安全漏洞的报告措辞严厉，但听证会上的议员们并没有对史密斯提出尖锐的质疑，而是把重点放在了政府和私营部门合作的方式上。这不是一场抓罪证的听证会.我们敦促整个行业的利益相关者、民间社会和我们的国际伙伴与我们合作，消除强迫劳动的苦难

The kind of lucrative endorsements enjoyed by foreign athletes are not usually given to Nepal’s ethnic Sherpas. For them, the profession of Himalayan guide offers a path out of deep poverty, but also a possible route — strewed with avalanches and icefalls — to a premature death.
尼泊尔的夏尔巴人通常得不到外国运动员享有的那种利润丰厚的代言合同。对他们来说，喜马拉雅向导的职业提供了一条摆脱极度贫困的道路，但也是一条到处都是雪崩和冰瀑，可能通往过早死亡的道路。

This is what a Sherpa does: He lugs heavy packs and oxygen cylinders for foreign clients. He cooks and sets up camp. He navigates through snowstorms and clears piles of trash. He wakes before dawn and spends hours driving metal pickets into the snow so a rope line can protect foreign climbers. He trudges past icefalls where bus-size slabs have buried other Sherpas in frozen graveyards. (On the mountain, he is usually a he; female Sherpas don’t tend to work as guides.)
夏尔巴人的工作如下：为外国客户搬运沉重的包裹和氧气瓶。做饭和搭帐篷。在暴风雪中穿行，清理成堆的垃圾。天不亮就起床，花几个小时在雪地上固定金属桩，拦出保护外国登山者的绳索。艰难地走过冰瀑，那些大巴车大小的板状冰体下，是夏尔巴人的坟场。(上山的夏尔巴人通常是男性；女性夏尔巴人一般不做向导。)

elevations above 26,000 feet, or 8,000 meters, where human cognition slows without supplemental oxygen and altitude sickness can quickly turn fatal.Yet their expertise earns them wages that, while high by local standards, are only a fraction of what most of their clients shell out for their expeditions.
海拔8000米以上的地方）能待的时间要长得多，在没有氧气补充的情况下，人类的认知会变迟钝，高原反应可能在短时间内导致死亡。

Mr. Lama lugged and hammered and pulled and hefted, making up for the missing half-dozen men. He was fast and efficient, with no unneeded movements in the thin air, Ms. Harila said.“Lama did all the jobs,” she said. “No one would have summited if Lama wasn’t there.”Whenever he could, after his exploits — 37 summits of the world’s tallest mountains by the time he died — Mr. Lama would return home to Walung, an isolated hamlet in northeastern Nepal. Walung sits in a high-altitude valley below barley and millet fields, where shaggy yaks graze, hunched against the cold. Mr. Lama and his brothers grew up herding livestock. They played soccer with a knot of worn socks serving as a ball.
“喇嘛”又拖又锤，又拉又扛，承担了那空缺的六人的工作。哈里拉说，他速度快，效率高，在稀薄的空气中没有任何不必要的动作。“‘喇嘛’做了所有的工作，”她说。“如果没有‘喇嘛’，没有人能登顶。”到“喇嘛”去世之前，他已经取得了登上了37座世界最高山峰的成就。一有时间，他就会回到瓦隆的家，那是尼泊尔东北部一个与世隔绝的小村庄，坐落在一个高海拔的山谷里，下面是大麦和谷田，毛茸茸的牦牛在田间吃草，弓着背抵御寒冷。“喇嘛”和兄弟们从小放牧牲畜。用破旧的袜子打结当足球踢。

Small scratches and dents are inevitable, but we have never had any major casualties,The government has not issued statistics on safety incidents involving driverless cars or advanced assisted-driving technologies, like automated lane changes and obstacle avoidance on highways. 
小刮小蹭在所难免，但没有出现过重大的人员伤亡事故。政府没有发布过涉及无人驾驶汽车或先进辅助驾驶技术的安全事故的统计数据，比如在高速公路上自动变道和躲避障碍物。

Over two days last month, I went for six rides in Baidu robot taxis in Wuhan. On one of the trips, with no safety driver ready to take over, the vehicle slowed nearly to a stop in fast-moving traffic on the upper deck of an expressway bridge high above the Yangtze River.It started beeping its horn automatically to yield the right of way, instead of accelerating to enter the adjacent lane. Both cars kept slowing until they were barely moving.A third car, moving at highway speed, whipped around both cars.
上个月的两天时间里，我在武汉乘坐了六次百度的机器人出租车。其中一次，没有配备安全驾驶员的自动驾驶出租车在一座长江大桥的上层公路桥快速行驶的车流中减速，几乎停了下来。它开始自动鸣笛以示礼让，而不是加速进入相邻车道。两辆车都在减速，直到它们几乎停下来。第三辆车以跑高速的速度绕过了我们这两辆车。

A spokeswoman said that the incident was an unusual circumstance and that drivers in Wuhan were seldom so willing to yield the right of way. She said the company would study the incident and consider whether to adjust the algorithms that control its driverless cars.Many drivers in Wuhan are indeed fairly aggressive. I saw a different robot taxi stop at a pedestrian crossing to allow people to walk across the street, only for motorists to blow their horns impatiently.
一名发言人表示，这起事件是一种不寻常的情况，武汉的司机很少如此愿意让路。她说，公司将研究这起事件，并会考虑是否调整控制无人驾驶汽车的算法。武汉的很多司机开车确实相当猛。我看到另一辆机器人出租车停在人行横道前，让行人过马路时，很多司机不耐烦地按起了喇叭。

The Chinese state media said the Philippine vessel had “ignored multiple stern warnings” and behaved “dangerously and in an unprofessional manner,” causing the boats to collide. The Philippines said that Chinese naval, coast guard and naval militia vessels had engaged in “illegal and aggressive actions,” including what it called “ramming.”
中国的官方媒体称，菲律宾船只“无视多次严厉警告”，以“不专业方式，故意危险接近中方正常航行船只”，导致双方船只相撞。菲律宾称，中国海军、海警和海上民兵的船只采取了“非法和侵略性行动”，包括所谓的“冲撞”。

Heavy rains battered southern China over the weekend and into Tuesday, setting off landslides and causing roads and homes to collapse as rivers overran their banks.Days of severe rainfall forced thousands of people to evacuate and left more than 100,000 households without power as the region was inundated.
上周末到本周二，暴雨袭击中国南方，引发山体滑坡，河流决堤导致道路塌陷，房屋倒塌。连日的强降雨迫使成千上万人撤离，由于洪水肆虐，该地区10多万户家庭停电。

The resort, where rooms start at $369 a night, features infinity pools, spas, eight restaurants, a private coastal walk and beach area, and a 4,600-meter “Water House” — an indoor pool and sauna fed by natural hot-spring water.
这个度假村的客房每晚起价369美元，设有无边泳池、水疗中心、八家餐厅、私人海滨步道和海滩区，以及一个4600米的“水屋”——一个使用天然温泉水的室内泳池和桑拿房。

 One leads a team at a financial firm and earns more than her husband. Another is pursuing her dream of becoming a civil servant. A third is a budding influencer who aspires to be the family breadwinner.
 一位女性在一家金融公司领导团队，收入超过了她的丈夫。另一位女性在追求成为公务员的梦想。还有一位女性是崭露头角的网红，希望能靠自己养家糊口。

 The American Institute office was for years in a crowded office in downtown Taipei, maintaining a diminished official presence. The operation took pains to keep a low profile, and for decades didn’t regularly fly the American flag.The U.S. flag is now a steady presence above the building.
 多年里，美国在台协会一直位于台北市中心一间拥挤的办公室里，保持着很弱的官方存在感。该机构极力保持低调，在过去几十年里一般情况下连国旗都不会悬挂。现在，美国国旗飘扬在大楼上方。

 Before he started a company 15 years ago selling the world’s smelliest fruit, Eric Chan had a well-paying job writing code for satellites and robots. His family and friends were puzzled when he made the career change.The fruit, durian, has long been a cherished part of local cultures in Southeast Asia, where it is grown in abundance.When Mr. Chan began his start-up in his native Malaysia, durians were cheap and often sold from the back of trucks.Then, China acquired a taste for durian in a very big way.
 15年前，埃里克·陈（音）创办了一家公司，销售世界上气味最强烈的水果。在此之前，他有一份为卫星和机器人编写代码的高薪工作。当他改行时，家人和朋友们都不理解。在盛产榴莲的东南亚，榴莲长期以来一直是当地文化中珍贵的一部分。当埃里克·陈在自己的祖国马来西亚开始创业时，榴莲的价格还很低廉，经常从卡车后斗出售.后来，许多中国人爱上了榴莲。

 In Vietnam, state news media reported last month that farmers were cutting down coffee plants to make room for durian. The acreage of durian orchards in Thailand has doubled over the past decade. In Malaysia, jungles in the hills outside Raub are being razed and terraced to make way for plantations that will cater to China’s lust for the fruit.
 在越南，官方新闻媒体上个月报道，农民正在砍伐咖啡树，为榴莲腾出空间。过去十年里，泰国的榴莲果园面积翻了一番。在马来西亚，劳布外山上的丛林正被夷为平地，修成梯田，为种植园让路，以满足中国对这种水果的需求。

Durian is to fruit what truffles are to mushrooms: Pound for pound, the fruit has become one of the most expensive on the planet. Depending on the variety, a single durian can sell for anywhere between $10 to hundreds of dollars.But shipping it to Guangzhou, Beijing and beyond, especially when the fruit is ripe and most flavorful, can be perilous. The fruit’s potent smell can resemble a gas leak.
榴莲在水果中的地位就像松露在蘑菇中的地位：按单位价格计算，榴莲已成为地球上最昂贵的水果之一。根据品种不同，一个榴莲的售价从10美元到数百美元不等。但是，把它运到广州、北京和其他地方可能会很危险，尤其是在水果成熟、味道最鲜美的时候。这种水果浓烈的气味就像煤气泄漏一样。

She quit her airline job and experimented with cryogenic freezing techniques in a rented warehouse, hauling her children to durian farms on weekends. She found that freezing not only mitigated the fruit’s odor but also prolonged its shelf life.
她辞掉了航空公司的工作，在租来的仓库里试验低温冷冻技术，周末带着孩子们前往榴莲果园。她发现，冷冻不仅能减轻水果的气味，还能延长保质期。

Throughout the Group of 7 summit meeting in Puglia, China has been the lurking presence: as the savior of “Russia’s war machine,” in the words of the summit’s final communiqué; as an intensifying threat in the South China Sea; and as a wayward economic actor, dumping electric cars in Western markets and threatening to withhold critical minerals needed by high-tech industries.
在普利亚举行的七国集团峰会中，中国的身影一直若隐若现：用峰会最后公报的话来说，它是“俄罗斯战争机器”的救星；在南海，它是日益加剧的威胁；作为一个任性的经济参与者，它向西方市场倾销电动汽车，并威胁要停止出口高科技行业所需的关键矿产。

Mr. Putin’s protracted war in Ukraine has led him to deepen relations with Mr. Kim. U.S. and South Korean officials say he has sought and received Soviet-grade ammunitions from Pyongyang — accusations that both Moscow and Pyongyang deny.South Korea sharply criticized the agreement, saying it was “sophistic and absurd” for North Korea and Russia — which have a history of starting war in the Korean Peninsula and in Ukraine, respectively — to pledge military cooperation under the assumption of coming under attack first.
普京在乌克兰旷日持久的战争促使他加深了与金正恩的关系。美国和韩国官员说，他从平壤寻求并获得了苏式弹药。莫斯科和平壤都否认了这一指控。韩国对这项协议表示强烈批评，称朝鲜和俄罗斯——两国分别在朝鲜半岛和乌克兰有过发动战争的历史——在自己先遭受攻击的假设下承诺进行军事合作，是“诡辩和荒谬的”。

In some respects, the meeting between the two authoritarian leaders, both desperate for outside support, provided a bit of an I-told-you-so moment for the United States and its Asian allies. Japan has vowed to increase its defense budget and pushed limits on what it could do under its pacifist Constitution, including purchasing more fighter jets and Tomahawk missiles. After years of frosty relations, Mr. Kishida and Mr. Yoon of South Korea agreed to strengthen bilateral ties between their two countries and have drawn closer in a three-way partnership with the U.S. to forge mutual security arrangements.
从某些方面来说，这两位迫切需要外界支持的威权领导人的会晤，让美国及其亚洲盟友有一种“果不其然”的感觉。日本誓言增加国防预算，并在和平宪法的限制范围内扩大行动，包括购买更多战斗机和战斧导弹。在经历了多年的冷淡关系后，岸田文雄和尹锡悦同意加强两国双边关系，并与美国建立了更紧密的三方伙伴关系，以建立共同安全安排。

The revival of a Cold War-era mutual defense pledge between North Korea and Russia in this fraught global moment spooked other countries in the region.At the very least, it shows that Russia is willing to flagrantly dismiss U.N. sanctions.I think it shows how prescient President Biden, President Kishida and President Yoon were to spend political capital,It was prescient not just from a political standpoint, but from a strategic standpoint because now Russia and North Korea” may be developing weapons together. The revival of a Cold War-era mutual defense pledge between North Korea and Russia in this fraught global moment spooked other countries in the region.
在这个充满危机的全球时刻，朝俄冷战时期共同防御承诺的复活，令该地区的其他国家感到恐慌。至少，这表明俄罗斯愿意公然无视联合国的制裁。我认为，这表明拜登总统、岸田文雄总统和尹锡悦总统在动用政治资本时非常有先见之明，不仅从政治角度来看很有先见之明，而且从战略角度来看也是如此，因为现在俄罗斯和朝鲜”可能正在共同开发武器。在这个充满危机的全球时刻，朝俄冷战时期共同防御承诺的复活，令该地区的其他国家感到恐慌。

The ravenous came for a taste of home in a dish of spicy fried beef or steamed fish head. Waiters, speaking in Mandarin, delivered plates heated with green and red chiles.It was opening night in Hong Kong at Return Home Hunan, a well-known chain from mainland China trying to wedge into the city’s competitive food scene.
饥肠辘辘的食客来这里品尝家乡的小炒黄牛肉或剁椒鱼头。服务员操着普通话，端上一盘盘少不了绿色和红色辣椒的热辣菜肴。这是来自中国内地的知名连锁餐厅“回家湘”在香港的开业之夜，它正试图打入香港竞争激烈的餐饮业。

Not far from Return Home Hunan, new restaurants offer food from three southern Chinese provinces: There’s the Guizhou rice noodles place, the Guangxi river snail noodles shop and stinky tofu from the province of Hunan.These establishments cater to locals and a growing community of mainland Chinese, some of whom have made the city their home in the past decade.
在离回家湘不远的地方新开了几家餐馆，提供来自中国南方三个省份的美食：贵州米粉、广西螺蛳粉和湖南臭豆腐。这些场所主要面向当地人和日益壮大的内地人群体，其中一些人在过去十年中来到这座城市安家。

The gripe among mainland transplants that Hong Kong food is bland has more of a sting for locals these days as they grapple with the city’s changing identity.Now, as Hong Kong is pulled closer into China’s orbit, an economic slowdown and real estate crisis on the mainland is weighing on its long-awaited recovery.
内地人抱怨香港食物太过清淡，如今这对本地人来说更加刺耳，因为他们正在努力应对这座城市身份的改变。现在，随着香港被拉近中国的轨道，内地的经济放缓和房地产危机正在拖累香港期待已久的复苏。

The Marubo people have long lived in communal huts scattered hundreds of miles along the Ituí River deep in the Amazon rainforest. They speak their own language, take ayahuasca to connect with forest spirits and trap spider monkeys to make soup or keep as pets.
马鲁博人长期居住在亚马孙雨林深处，散布在伊图伊河沿岸数百公里的共有小屋中。他们说自己的语言，服用死藤水与森林精灵沟通，捕捉蜘蛛猴做汤或当做宠物。

The Javari Valley Indigenous Territory is one of the most isolated places on Earth, a dense stretch of rainforest the size of Portugal with no roads and a maze of waterways. Nineteen of the 26 tribes in the Javari Valley live in full isolation, the highest concentration in the world.
哈瓦里河谷原住民领地是地球上最为与世隔绝的地方之一，这片茂密的雨林面积与葡萄牙相当，没有道路，只有迷宫般的水道。哈瓦里山谷有26个部落，是世界上最密集的部落群，其中有19个完全与外界隔绝。

The Marubo were once uncontacted, too, roaming the forest for hundreds of years, until rubber tappers arrived near the end of the 19th century. That led to decades of violence and disease — and the arrival of new customs and technology. The Marubo began wearing clothes. Some learned Portuguese. They swapped bows for firearms to hunt wild boar, and machetes for chain saws to clear plots for cassava.
马鲁博人也曾经与世隔绝，在丛林里游荡了几百年，直到19世纪末采集橡胶的人来到这里。由此而来的是数十年的暴力和疾病，同时也带来了新的习俗和技术。马鲁博人开始穿衣服。一些人学习葡萄牙语。他们把弓箭换成了猎枪来猎杀野猪，把砍刀换成了链锯来清理木薯地。

Allyson Reneau’s LinkedIn page describes her as a space consultant, keynote speaker, author, pilot, equestrian, humanitarian, chief executive, board director and mother of 11 biological children. In person, she says she makes most of her money coaching gymnastics and renting houses near Norman, Okla.
艾莉森·勒诺在领英页面上的描述是太空顾问、主题讲者、作家、飞行员、马术运动员、人道主义者、首席执行官、董事和11个亲生子女的母亲。她说，她本人的大部分收入都来自在俄克拉荷马州诺曼附近做体操教练和出租房屋。

The internet arrived on the backs of men. They trudged miles through the forest, barefoot or in flip-flops, carrying two antennas each. The internet was an immediate sensation. “It changed the routine so much that it was detrimental,” Enoque admitted. “In the village, if you don’t hunt, fish and plant, you don’t eat.”
互联网设备是男人们背进来的，有人光着脚，有人穿着人字拖，在丛林里跋涉数公里，每人背着两部天线。互联网的到来立刻引起了轰动。“这极大地改变了我们的日常生活，以至于产生了有害影响，”伊诺克承认。“在村里，如果你不打猎、不捕鱼、不种菜，就没有饭吃。”

Smoke in the cabin. A tire blowout. A cracked windshield. No shortage of problems can affect a flight, fueling traveler anxiety and contributing to thousands of daily delays and cancellations around the world. But for all of the frustration and alarm such events cause, it can be difficult to interpret and understand their severity.
机舱内冒烟。轮胎爆裂。挡风玻璃破裂。影响航班的问题层出不穷，让旅客焦虑不安，并导致全球每天有数千个航班延误和取消。这类事件引发了极大的不满和恐慌，要解释和理解它们的严重程度却并不容易。

Several alarming air travel incidents have made headlines in recent weeks — a sharp plunge toward an ocean, an unnerving wobble that damaged the tail of a plane and an aborted departure after an apparent engine fire. But the most common mishaps and malfunctions, even if hair-raising, are not typically severe, experts said. A hydraulic leak, for example, is a familiar occurrence that pilots take seriously, but it is not as disruptive as it may sound. 
最近几周里，几起令人担忧的航空旅行事件成了新闻头条——一次是飞机向海面急剧俯冲，一次是令人胆寒的晃动损坏了飞机的尾翼，以及引擎起火导致放弃起飞。但专家表示，那些最为常见的事故和故障即使听起来让人害怕，通常也并不严重。例如，液压泄漏是飞行员非常重视的常见故障，但它并不像听起来那样具有破坏性。

Flying is a complex, gravity-defying feat that’s repeated thousands of times each day in a wide range of conditions.Little small components will always start to burn out or break,There will always be potholes in the pavement in the taxiway that jostles something. A plane veering off a runway, in what is known as a runway excursion, makes for captivating video and a possibly terrifying experience for those on board. But it doesn’t necessarily cause significant damage to an airplane or threaten the safety of those on board.
飞行是一项复杂的、挑战重力的壮举，每天都要在各种条件下重复无数次。总会有小部件烧坏或损坏，滑行道上的路面总会有坑坑洼洼，导致一些碰撞。一架飞机偏离跑道，拍成视频看起来会很刺激，对机上的人来说可能也是一次可怕的经历。但它并不一定会给飞机造成严重损害，威胁到机上人员的安全。

Placing blame is complicated.Because aviation is complex and defined by redundancy, problems rarely have a singular cause. Instead, most serious problems — even catastrophic ones — are a result of multiple factors.There’s never a smoking gun, so to speak,
追责非常复杂。因为航空业非常复杂，而且有冗余设计的特征，所以问题很少有单一的原因。相反，大多数最严重的问题——甚至是灾难性的问题——是多种因素共同作用的结果。

The users’ profiles often made them appear to be American, though with few or even no followers. Many posts featured stilted, ungrammatical English, a signature of Spamouflage campaigns.
这些用户的个人资料往往会让人觉得他们是美国人，但关注他们的人很少，甚至根本没有。许多帖子都使用蹩脚、不合语法的英语，这是“水军伪装”活动的一个标志。

“China’s securities regulator has been traditionally draconian when it comes to letting companies list — and this plan is even tighter,” Mr. Collier said. “A lot of companies are worried about listing in China or feel they can’t squeeze themselves through the eye of the needle.”
“中国的证券监管机构向来对公司上市非常严格，而这次的计划则更为严厉，”科利尔说。“很多公司都对于在中国上市感到担心，或者觉得自己无法满足如此苛刻的条件。”

But for many people in those countries, and among the estimated two million ethnic Koreans in China, the chance to make far more money outweighs the dangers.Because ethnic Korean Chinese, known as “dongpo,” or “people from the same womb,” understand the language and culture, many managers in South Korea prefer to hire them. 
但对这些国家的许多人，以及估计达200万人的中国朝鲜族来说，赚钱的机会远比危险重要。朝鲜族中国人了解韩国的语言和文化，被称为“同胞”，韩国的许多管理人员也更愿意雇佣他们。但并不是所有人都欢迎他们

Such sentiments and the prospects of international lunar sample exchanges highlighted the hope that China’s robotic missions to the moon and Mars will serve to advance scientific understanding of the solar system. Those possibilities are contrasted by views in Washington and elsewhere that Tuesday’s achievement is the latest milestone in a 21st-century space race with geopolitical overtones.
这种情绪和国际月球样本交换的前景凸显了外界的希望，即中国的月球和火星机器人探测任务将有助于促进对太阳系的科学理解。与此形成鲜明对比的是，华盛顿等方面的观点认为，周二的成就是21世纪具有地缘政治色彩的太空竞赛的最新里程碑。

One year later, it landed Chang’e-5, which sent nearly four pounds of near-side lunar regolith to the Earth. The achievement made China only the third country — after the United States and the Soviet Union — to achieve the complex orbital choreography of collecting a sample from the moon.The Chang’e-5 sample was younger than the lunar material collected by the Americans or Soviets in the 1960s and ’70s. It is made up mainly of basalts, or cooled lava from ancient volcanic eruptions.
一年后，中国的嫦娥五号着陆月球，将1731克重的月球表面风化层样本送回地球。这一成就使中国成为继美国和苏联之后第三个实现从月球采集样本这一复杂轨道规划的国家。嫦娥五号样本比美国和苏联在20世纪60年代和70年代收集的月球物质更年轻。它主要由玄武岩或古代火山喷发的冷却熔岩组成。

Chang’e-6 launched on May 3 with even grander scientific ambitions: bringing back material from the far side of the moon. The near side of the moon is dominated by wide, dark plains where ancient lava once flowed. But the far side has fewer of those plains. It also has more craters and a thicker crust.
嫦娥六号于5月3日发射，其科学抱负更加宏大：从月球背面带回物质。月球的表面主要是广阔的黑暗平原，那里曾经流淌着古老的熔岩。但背面的平原较少。它还有更多的陨石坑和更厚的壳层。

It then stashed the material away. The mission deployed a miniature rover that snapped a picture of the lander with a small Chinese flag raised. Then, on June 3, a rocket flung the sample canister back into lunar orbit. The materials then reunited on June 6 with a spacecraft that had remained in orbit and prepared to begin the journey back to Earth.
然后，它把这些材料收起。这次任务部署了一辆微型漫游车，它拍下了着陆器升起一面小中国国旗的照片。然后，在6月3日，上升器将样本容器带回月球轨道。6月6日，这些材料与留在轨道上的飞船会合，准备开始返回地球的旅程。

Mr. Kwon — who speaks Chinese, English and some Korean — called the local police for help. For an hour, he waited while trying to fend off mosquitoes by walking around his watercraft in beige Crocs.But he didn’t let his guard down. He stuck to the routines he had developed in China: constantly checking for security cameras, and using encrypted texting apps and signal-blocking Faraday bags.
会讲中文、英语和一些韩语的权平打电话向当地警方求助。在等待的一个小时里，他穿着米色的卡骆驰洞洞鞋在摩托艇周围走来走去，试图驱赶蚊子。但他没有放松警惕。他坚持在中国养成的习惯：不断检查安全摄像头，使用加密短信应用程序和能屏蔽信号的法拉第袋。

He had only Sundays off from his job at a Chinese restaurant, Sampan Cafe. On some of those days, we watched American football, and we looked at my math textbooks, algebra or geometry or calculus. He knew numbers. I would learn later that he had studied engineering after the army.But one day, while I was visiting from graduate school and starting to ask my parents about their upbringings in southern China, Dad showed me a photograph of himself from his days in the Communist army.
他在一家名叫上坪楼的中餐馆工作，只有周日不上班。那些日子里，我们一起看橄榄球，一起看我的数学课本，代数、几何还有微积分。他数学很好。我后来才知道，他退伍后学的是工程学。但是，有一天，我从研究生院回来看望父母，询问他们在中国南方的成长经历，爸爸给我看了一张他在共产党军队服役时的照片。

It had been taken in northwest China in 1953. My father’s eyes glimmered, and his skin had none of the lines of age. He wore a plain military uniform and a cap. I ran a finger over a darkened spot in the hat’s center. A shadow there. That was where the red star had been, he said. The symbol of the People’s Liberation Army of China.He was filled with dread about what awaited him, but he was also struck by the beauty of a China he had never seen.
那是1953年在中国西北拍摄的。父亲的眼睛炯炯有神，皮肤上没有一丝岁月的痕迹。他穿着朴素的军装，戴着一顶军帽。我用手指轻轻划过帽子中间的一个黑点。那里有一个阴影。他说，那里原来有一颗红星，是中国人民解放军的标志。他对即将到来的一切充满了恐惧，但从未见过的中国美景也令他震撼。

Heading west from Xi’an, the capital of Shaanxi Province, he remembered the persimmons, plump and smooth and the color of burned copper, hanging low from the trees in the autumn light. How sweet it would be to bite into one. Dust trailed the truck as it continued down the dirt road. He was heading into a vast and sere land, a place of ancient paths and towns, many now long gone. A frontier. The warriors who came before them, also gone.
他记得当时从陕西省会西安一路向西，秋天的阳光下，柿子丰满光滑，颜色像烧红的铜，低低垂挂在树上。如果能咬一口，该有多甜啊。卡车在土路上行驶，尘土飞扬。他正驶向一片广袤而荒凉的土地，那里有许多古老的道路和城镇，其中许多现在早已不复存在。那是边疆地带。在他们之前曾经来到这里的兵将，也已经不在人世。

It is an iconic image — a black-and-white photo of a blood-splattered student being clubbed by a paratrooper medic. It was the first photo to slip through the military cordon around Gwangju, South Korea, in 1980, exposing the brutal suppression of what would be known as the Gwangju Democratization Movement.
这是一个标志性画面——一张黑白照片中，一名身上带着血迹的学生被一名伞兵军医用棍棒殴打。这是1980年第一张穿过韩国光州一带军事封锁线的照片，揭露了对后来被称为光州民主化运动的残酷镇压。

The consequences have been dire. At this year’s hajj, the Islamic pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, at least 1,300 people died as temperatures surpassed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. And in many ways, that heavy toll was just the latest sign that crowd control and heat waves fueled by climate change are on a dangerous collision course.Even as heat kills more people today than any other extreme weather event, there is still a dangerous cultural lag. 
后果是可怕的。在今年沙特阿拉伯的圣地朝觐中，至少有1300人在超过摄氏37度的气温之下死亡。人群控制和气候变化引发的热浪正在汇合成一股危险的力量，此次惨重的伤亡只是这一趋势的最新例证。如今酷暑造成的死亡人数超过了其他任何极端天气事件，但仍存在一种危险的文化滞后。

The hardest fix of all may be one that is also in some ways the simplest: educating ordinary people about the risks of heat, including those who are accustomed to living in hot places. Often, they are unaware of the early symptoms of heat stress or how high temperatures are especially dangerous for people with pre-existing health conditions, like kidney disease or hypertension. Even medicines, such as anticholinergic drugs, that treat allergies or asthma can accelerate problems by restricting sweat.
最困难的解决办法可能也是最简单的：教育普通人了解炎热的危害，包括那些习惯于在炎热地区生活的人。通常，他们不知道热应激的早期症状，也不知道高温对已经患有肾病或高血压等疾病的人来说是多么危险。即使是治疗过敏或哮喘的药物，如抗胆碱能药物，也会因排汗受限而加速问题的出现。

Health officials in India have had to prepare. Inside heatstroke units in Delhi hospitals, patients were immediately immersed in an ice-filled submersion tub to bring down their temperatures. In a ward equipped with an ice-making refrigerator, ice boxes and ventilators, critical patients were immediately placed on slabs of ice and injected with cold fluids.
印度卫生官员被迫应对。在德里医院的中暑病房里，病人被立即浸泡在装满冰的浴缸里，以降低体温。在一个配备了制冰机、冰盒和呼吸机的病房里，危重患者被立即放在冰块上，并浇灌冷水。

Such presidential debate moments — missteps, one-liners, flops and various “Oops” moments — can even land in the history books.In the first televised presidential debate, in 1960, a confident Senator John F. Kennedy dominated Vice President Richard Nixon, who appeared sweaty and disheveled as he recovered from an illness. President Ronald Reagan used a joke to deflate concerns about his age in 1984.
这样的总统辩论时刻——失误、金句、失败和各种让人惊呼糟糕的时刻——甚至可以载入史册。在1960年的第一次电视总统辩论中，自信的参议员约翰·F·肯尼迪压倒了副总统尼克松，后者大病初愈，汗流满面，整个人显得一团糟。里根总统用一个笑话来缓解人们对他年龄的担忧

President Biden struggled through his first debate of the 2024 campaign against Donald J. Trump, meandering and mumbling through answers as the former president pressed his case for a second term with limited resistance from his rival.They disagreed on abortion, inflation, climate change, foreign affairs and immigration. But the sharpest contrast was in their presentation.
拜登总统在与特朗普进行2024年总统竞选的第一场辩论中举步维艰，回答问题时迂回不清，口齿含糊，对前总统争取第二任期造成的阻力非常有限。双方在堕胎、通货膨胀、气候变化、外交事务和移民问题上存在分歧。但最鲜明的对比在于他们的样子。

Mr. Trump was confident and forceful, even as he let loose a stream of misleading attacks and falsehoods. Mr. Biden spoke with a hoarse and halting voice, closing his eyes occasionally to gather thoughts that sometimes couldn’t be corralled. Democratic anxiety rose by the minute. About halfway through, people close to Mr. Biden put out word that he had a cold.Mr. Trump relentlessly hammered Mr. Biden on areas of vulnerability, sending exaggerations and embellishments — he was the “greatest” and his opponent the “worst” — flying unchecked through the audience-free CNN studio in Atlanta.
特朗普自信而有力，尽管他发表了一连串误导性的攻击和谎言。拜登声音沙哑、结结巴巴，偶尔会闭上眼睛整理思路，但有时无法集中思绪。民主党人的焦虑每时每刻都在加剧。大约在辩论进行到一半时，拜登身边的人放出消息说，他感冒了。特朗普无情地抨击拜登的弱点，未经核实的各种夸张和修饰——他本人是“最伟大的”，而他的对手是“最差劲的”——这些都在没有观众的亚特兰大CNN演播室里漫天横飞。

President Biden hoped to build fresh momentum for his re-election bid by agreeing to debate two months before he is formally nominated. Instead, his halting and disjointed performance on Thursday night prompted a wave of panic among Democrats and reopened discussion of whether he should be the nominee at all.
拜登总统同意在得到正式提名前两个月进行辩论，希望以此为连任竞选造势。然而，他在周四晚上磕磕绊绊、语不连贯的表现在民主党人中引发了一波恐慌，并促使他们再次开始讨论他是否应该成为提名人。

Over the course of 90 minutes, a raspy-voiced Mr. Biden struggled to deliver his lines and counter a sharp though deeply dishonest former President Donald J. Trump, raising doubts about the incumbent president’s ability to wage a vigorous and competitive campaign four months before the election. Rather than dispel concerns about his age, Mr. Biden, 81, made it the central issue.
在90分钟的时间里，声音沙哑的拜登艰难地做出自己的表达，与尽管谎话连篇但口齿伶俐的前总统特朗普抗衡，让人怀疑现任总统是否有能力在大选前四个月前开展一场激烈而有竞争力的竞选活动。81岁的拜登没有消除人们对他年龄的担忧，而是令这一点成为核心问题。

Biden is about to face a crescendo of calls to step aside,Joe had a deep well of affection among Democrats. It has run dry.Parties exist to win,The man on the stage with Trump cannot win. The fear of Trump stifled criticism of Biden. Now that same fear is going to fuel calls for him to step down.
拜登将面临越来越多要求他让位的呼声，民主党人对乔有着深厚的感情。现在这感情已经干涸。政党的存在就是为了获胜，那个和特朗普同台的人不可能赢。对特朗普的恐惧压制了对拜登的批评。现在，同样的恐惧将助长要求他让位的呼声。

Mr. Biden left the CNN studio in Atlanta instead facing a referendum on himself and his capacity that will reverberate for days if not longer.Mr. Trump, 78, appeared to coast through the debate with little trouble, even as he rattled off one falsehood after another without being effectively challenged. He appeared confident while avoiding the same excessively overbearing demeanor that damaged him during his first debate with Mr. Biden in 2020, seemingly content to let his opponent stew in his own difficulties.
然而，当拜登离开亚特兰大的CNN演播室时，却面临着一场关于他本人及其能力的公投，这场公投的影响将持续数日甚至更久。78岁的特朗普在辩论中似乎游刃有余，尽管他滔滔不绝地说出一个又一个谎言，却没有受到任何有效的质疑。他显得信心十足，同时避免了在2020年与拜登的第一次辩论中损害他的那种过分霸道的举止，似乎认为让对手深陷在自己的困境之中就足够了。

Both generals had been members of the commission. General Li “betrayed the party’s founding aspirations and party principles, and his actions betrayed the trust of the party’s Central Committee and the Central Military Commission,” the party said. General Wei was further accused of a “collapse in faith” in the party.Mr. Xi underscored his determination to root out misconduct and perceived disloyalty in the Chinese military earlier this month, when he met with commanders in Yan’an, an officially hallowed area of northwest China where Mao Zedong gathered forces during the revolution and war against Japan.
这两人都曾是中共中央政治局的成员。公告写道，李尚福“背弃初心使命、丧失党性原则，其行为辜负了党中央、中央军委信任重托”。魏凤和还被指控对党“信仰坍塌”。本月早些时候，习近平在延安接见指挥官时强调，他决心根除中国军队中的不当行为和被视为不忠的行为。延安是位于中国西北部的一个官方红色圣地，毛泽东在革命和抗日战争期间曾在此集结部队。
