In a social media post, he compared Mr. Biden to Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor who “screwed up his succession by passing the baton to his feckless son Commodus, whose disastrous rule started Rome’s decline.”“It’s important to manage one’s ride into the sunset,” Mr. Sikorski added.
他在社交媒体上发帖，将拜登与罗马皇帝马可·奥勒留相提并论，他写道，奥勒留“把接力棒交给了无能的儿子康茂德，搞砸了自己的权力交接，康茂德的灾难性统治开启了罗马的衰落”。“安排好暮年的最后一段工作，这非常重要，”西科尔斯基写道。

With cash for clunkers, the government pushes consumers to buy from big manufacturing industries. But in cities like Jingdezhen, a pottery-making hub for more than 1,000 years, there are hints that China’s consumers would spend more if the government gave them cash instead and let them choose how to spend it.
政府通过以旧换新鼓励消费者购买大型制造业的产品。但在景德镇这样的城市，已有迹象表明，如果政府直接把现金交给消费者，让他们选择如何花钱的话，中国消费者们花钱的意愿会更高。景德镇是有1000多年历史的陶瓷制造中心。

In broader terms, however, Russia’s participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is largely a rear-guard action to counterbalance the region’s seemingly inexorable shift toward China. Instead, the Kremlin has sought to maintain a measure of leverage in its former satellites on issues that remain vital to its national interests, including by attending largely symbolic events like the Astana summit. 
然而，从更广泛的角度来看，俄罗斯加入上海合作组织在很大程度上是一种防卫行动，以制衡该地区似乎不可阻挡地向中国倾斜的趋势。相反，克里姆林宫试图在对其国家利益至关重要的问题上，对俄罗斯的前卫星国保持一定程度的影响力，包括参加阿斯塔纳峰会等主要是象征性的活动。

Censors have meticulously scrubbed and limited online discussions of the dispute — a level of censorship experts say is rare outside the most politically sensitive topics.
审查人员细致地过滤和限制了网上对这一争议的讨论——专家们表示，这种程度的审查很少见于最敏感的政治话题之外。

The bigger news, though, might be what officials were wearing at the meeting in Pyongyang, the capital: chest pins bearing Mr. Kim’s image, according to photos released through state media.By introducing a pin of his own image, Mr. Kim is elevating his idolization and the personality cult surrounding him to match the level reserved, until now, only for his grandfather
但更大的新闻也许是出席这个在首都平壤召开的会议的官员们佩戴的东西：据朝鲜官媒发布的照片​​，他们胸前都佩戴着金正恩像章。韩国官员和分析人士称，金正恩推出自己的像章，是将对他的个人崇拜和迷信提升到了此前保留给金日成和金正日的水平。

Under Mr. Kim, North Korea has conducted four underground nuclear tests and developed a fleet of missiles, including long-range rockets able to reach the continental United States. Mr. Kim has tried to reinvent his family’s rule, casting himself as a young, energetic and even transformative leader. He has emphasized his family lineage by dressing like his grandfather, but has also appeared to distance himself from his forebears in an effort to move out of their long shadows and show that he is a worthy leader in his own right.
在金正恩的领导下，朝鲜已经进行了四次地下核试验，研发出一系列的导弹，包括能够打击美国本土的远程导弹。金正恩试图以新形式展现金氏统治，将自己塑造为一名年轻、精力充沛，甚至具有变革精神的领导人。他用祖父风格的穿着来强调自己的家族血统，但同时似乎也想与先辈保持距离，努力摆脱他们长长的影子，让自己看起来是一名值得尊敬的领导人。

Russia’s state-owned Channel One covered the debate in depth, describing President Biden and Donald Trump as “small children from the nursery.” As Russian viewers were treated to replays of the candidates bickering over who was the better golfer, the presenter predicted that life itself in America would become “one never-ending game of golf,” with the United States lurching “from one big hole to the next.”
作为俄罗斯的国家电视台，第一频道深入报道了这场辩论，将拜登和特朗普描述为“托儿所里的小孩”。随着电视台将两名候选人争论谁的高尔夫打得更好的片段重放给俄罗斯观众，主持人预言，随着美国“从一个大洞滚向另一个大洞”，美国人的生活将变成“一场没完没了的高尔夫球运动”。

They have tried to plant the idea among their own people and their sympathizers in the West and developing nations that the United States is not a democracy at all but a dysfunctional oligarchy in terminal decline.
他们试图在本国人民，以及他们在西方和发展中国家的同情者当中灌输一个观念：美国根本就不民主，而是机能失调的寡头政治，正在无可挽回地走向衰落。

Their tactics may be effective in the short term. Prophecies of America’s implosion have already fed anxiety among U.S. partners and allies. European leaders live in dread of a potential Trump-led American undermining of NATO, trying desperately to Trump-proof Europe against such an unfortunate eventuality by developing an E.U.-wide defense industrial strategy and considering whether to appoint an E.U. defense commissioner. 
策略也许在短期内有效。美国崩溃的预言已在美国的伙伴和盟友中加剧了焦虑感。欧洲领导人们整天提心吊胆，生怕美国可能在特朗普领导下削弱北约，他们正在迫不及待地试图防止欧洲在美国大选出现不幸结局的情况下遭受特朗普上台的影响，做法包括发展欧盟范围的国防工业战略，以及考虑是否任命一名欧盟国防专员。

A deeper question is embedded in the doubts America’s adversaries are sowing. If the two leading presidential candidates have nothing better to do than to spar over who is the better golfer, where does this leave America’s vision for the world? Is America still the shining city upon a hill, or is its prolonged political malaise a sign that something is burning down?
一个更深层次的问题镶嵌在美国的对手们正在散布的疑虑中。如果这两名主要的总统候选人除了争论谁的高尔夫打得更好之外无事可做的话，这对美国的世界视野来说意味着什么？美国仍是耀眼的山巅之城吗？还是其长期的政治问题预示着内部已有将其焚毁的火苗？

At the time, the Kremlin was certain that the world was going its way and sought to extend power and influence to far-flung corners of the world. The Soviets were all too keen to take advantage of America’s problems by advertising America’s high crime rates and rampant drug addiction. In the words of one Politburo document from 1971, the Soviet policy was to discredit the United States, “thus undermining the U.S. position as the leader of the bourgeois world.”
克里姆林宫当时曾确信，世界正在朝着它希望的方向发展，并试图将权力和影响力扩大到世界各个角落。苏联政府非常热衷于通过大肆宣扬美国的高犯罪率和吸毒泛滥来利用美国的问题。用1971年的一份政治局文件中的话说，苏联的政策是败坏美国的名声，“从而破坏美国作为资产阶级世界领袖的地位。”

Yes, America is at a low moment. And there may be darker days still ahead, with no promise of a quick resolution or even a smooth election this fall.But history has shown that resilience is built into the American system — through its institutional constraints, accountability and genuine, meaningful debate about the country’s direction. Amid all this turmoil, an American comeback still feels possible, even plausible. America in decline is America on the road to renewal.
是的，美国正处于低谷。美国未来也许还有更黑暗的日子，没有快速的解决方案，甚至不会有一场顺利的秋季大选。但历史已表明，通过其制度约束、问责制，以及对国家方向的真正的、有意义的辩论，美国的体制里嵌入了迅速恢复的能力。在面临所有这些动荡的时候，美国的复苏仍有可能，甚至合理。走向衰落的美国是正走在复兴之路上的美国。

If the backbone of a society is completely submerged by the tide of nationalism, the future fate of the country is predictable. In this grand drama that plays out every day, some are directors, some are actors, some set the stage while the others are the audience, He has become too deeply immersed in the play, finding it difficult to extricate himself
如果中流砥柱被民族主义大潮彻底淹没，那么这个国家的未来命运也可想而知, 这场天天都在上演的大戏中，有人是导演，有人是演员，有人是搭台的，有人是看戏的，而他，入戏太深，难以自拔。

That dizzying reversal of political fortunes speaks to the turmoil that has engulfed Britain since it voted to leave the European Union in 2016. Brexit fractured the Conservative Party, leaving it increasingly erratic and extreme, as it confronted the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic and a cost-of-living crisis. With Labour on the threshold of power, it faces hard trade-offs that reflect the fallout from those years: a country depleted, exhausted and desperate for change.
这种令人眼花缭乱的政治命运的逆转表明，自2016年投票退出欧盟以来，英国一直处于动荡之中。英国脱欧使保守党分裂，使其在面对新冠大流行和生活成本危机的挑战时变得越来越不稳定和极端。即将执政之际，工党面临着艰难的权衡，反映了那些年带来的影响和后果：一个资源枯竭、精疲力竭、迫切需要改变的国家。

Labour said it would also hire 8,500 health workers to treat patients with mental health issues, as well as doubling the number of C.T. scanners and M.R.I. machines in hospitals. It would finance this by closing a loophole for people who claim non-domiciled status in Britain, allowing them to avoid paying some taxes. But its immediate challenge would be to resolve a long-festering wage dispute with junior doctors.
工党表示，它还将雇用8500名医疗保健从业人员来治疗有精神健康问题的患者，并将医院的CT扫描仪和核磁共振仪的数量增加一倍。它将通过堵住非定居者逃税漏洞来为此筹集资金。但眼下的挑战将是解决与初级医生之间旷日持久的工资纠纷。

In the 1980s, a French punk rock band coined a rallying cry against the country’s far right that retained its punch over decades. The chant, still shouted at protests by the left, is “La jeunesse emmerde le Front National,” which cannot be translated well without curse words, but essentially tells the far right to get lost.
上世纪80年代，一支法国朋克摇滚乐队创造了反对该国极右翼的战斗口号，几十年来一直保持着冲击力。这句“La jeunesse emmerde le Front National”如今仍然是左翼人士在抗议时喊出的口号，如果不用脏话，就无法翻译出它的精髓，实际上，它的意思是让极右翼人士滚开。

Some people were openly hostile, crumpling the leaflets and angrily referring to the party’s antisemitic and racist past. “This, to me, is fascism,” one older man said in broken French, pointing to a leaflet featuring a beaming Mr. Bardella. “I don’t feel at home anymore,” Mr. Ludon said, referring to an influx of migrants. “Finding a French butcher has become hard.” Asked to elaborate, he said he meant a butcher that was not halal.
一些人公开表示敌意，把传单揉成一团，愤怒地提到该党的反犹和种族主义历史。“对我来说，这就是法西斯主义，”一名年长的男子指着一份印有笑容满面的巴尔德拉的传单，用蹩脚的法语说。“我再也没有家的感觉了，”卢东在谈到移民潮的时候说。“找一个法国屠夫都变得很难。”当被要求详细说明时，他说他指的是非清真的屠夫。

It is just that chumminess, and the far-right agenda he is working to humanize, that frightens many young people from immigrant backgrounds or who belong to ethnic minorities.“Even before these results, people were attacked, insulted and spit on,” said Mariam Touré, 22, a law student and community activist who was at the event. Her family fled civil war in Ivory Coast in 2003 and arrived in France in 2009.“At the same time,” she added, her voice cracking, “I am very scared.”
正是这种和蔼可亲的态度，以及他正在努力使之人性化的极右翼议程，让许多有移民背景或属于少数族裔的年轻人感到害怕。“甚至在这些结果出来之前，人们就遭到了攻击、侮辱和唾骂，”在场的22岁的法律系学生、社区活动人士玛丽亚姆·图雷说。她的家人于2003年逃离科特迪瓦内战，于2009年来到了法国。“与此同时，”她声音沙哑地补充道，“我非常害怕。”

Influential voices in his own party have called for him to step aside. Polls indicate that many voters hope he will. Yet so far, he is staying the course.There’s a formal name for this trap: escalation of commitment to a losing course of action. In the face of impending failure, extensive evidence shows, instead of rethinking our plans, we often double down on our decisions. It feels better to be a fighter than a quitter.
党内有影响力的声音要求他让位。民意调查显示，许多选民也希望他会这样做。然而到目前为止，他仍在坚持。这样的陷阱有一个正式的名字：对正在失败的行为做出承诺升级。大量的证据表明，面对即将到来的失败，我们往往不是重新考虑计划，而是为这个计划加倍努力。做斗士比做放弃者感觉更好。

One of the tragedies of the human condition is that we use our big brains not to make rational decisions but rather to rationalize the decisions we’ve already made. We stick around too long in dead-end jobs. We stay in unhappy marriages even after friends have counseled us to leave. We stand by candidates even after they violate our principles.
人类的悲剧之一在于，我们的大脑不是用来做出理性的决定，而是用来把已经做出的决定合理化。我们在没有前途的职位上苦苦坚持。即使朋友劝告，我们也会维持不幸福的婚姻。即使候选人违反了我们的原则，我们也会支持他们。

Mr. Morimoto said the lesson learned by Japan from recent currency fluctuations was that military spending could no longer be fixed to a precise number. Rather, he said, the focus needs to be on building military capabilities in terms of substance.
森本说，日本从最近的汇率波动中吸取的教训是，军费开支不能再固定在一个精确的数字上。相反，他说，重点应该放在建设实质性的军事能力上。

Middle-class “success,” however, offers no respite: Exhaustion is palpable as these young women continue to hustle and grind just to stay afloat. As Yang explains, this is the omnipresent Chinese fear of “falling off the ladder.” And over the last 30 years, as massive socioeconomic inequality has taken root, “the ladder has grown very tall.”
然而，中产阶级的“成功”并没有带来喘息的机会：为了维持生计，这些年轻女性继续奔波劳碌，疲惫显而易见。杨缘解释道，这就是中国人无处不在的对于“从梯子上掉下来”的恐惧。而在过去的30年里，随着巨大的社会经济不平等变得根深蒂固，“梯子越来越高了。”

The social milieu that Yang’s subjects inhabit, hovering between rural pasts and urban futures, is riddled with uncertainty. Lives and destinies can change overnight, with one pen stroke — and an ensuing new government policy.
杨缘笔下的主人公所处的社会环境徘徊在农村的过去与城市的未来之间，充满着不确定性。生活和命运可以在一夜之间发生改变，只需大笔一挥——还有随之而来的新的国家政策。

Leiya’s careful navigation of a byzantine points system to ensure that her daughter has a chance at entering a desirable school in Shenzhen is derailed when the school district map is redrawn. These setbacks offer no time for self-pity or reflection: Pivot they must, and they do, in order to survive.
为了确保女儿有机会在深圳进入一所理想的学校，蕾雅在繁琐复杂的积分系统中小心摸索，却因学区重新划分而功亏一篑。对于这些挫折，她们没有时间自怜或反思：为了生存，她们必须做出调整，而且也确实做到了。

Ms. Koike’s victory provided a much-needed shot in the arm for the governing Liberal Democratic Party, which had backed her in the race. Approval ratings have been falling for the party, and the Tokyo governor’s election was viewed in part as a referendum on the national government’s popularity.
小池的胜利为支持她参选的执政党自民党注入了一剂急需的强心针。自民党的支持率一直在下降，东京都知事的选举在一定程度上被视为对日本政府民望的全民公决。

The proliferation of candidates could reflect fatigue with politics as usual, but many of the hopefuls were also unserious attention seekers, creating a farcical, circuslike atmosphere and putting real change further out of reach.
候选人的激增可能反映出人们对政治一如既往的厌倦，但许多只为了获得关注的参选者并不是真心竞选，这就制造了一种闹剧般的气氛，使得真正的变革更加遥不可及。

Other candidates took swings at the national government. Yusuke Kawai, who appeared in a campaign video on NHK, the public broadcaster, with stringy hair, face whitened and lips smeared red in a caricature of the Joker from the Batman franchise, lambasted Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for his plans to raise taxes.During a campaign broadcast on NHK, Airi Uchino, the young entrepreneur, removed a striped, button-down shirt to reveal her cleavage in a cream-colored tube top. 
其他候选人也对国家政府进行了抨击。河合悠佑在公共广播公司NHK的竞选视频中出现，头发蓬乱，脸涂成白色，嘴唇涂成红色，模仿《蝙蝠侠》系列中的小丑，猛烈抨击日本首相岸田文雄的增税计划。在NHK播出的一场竞选活动中，年轻的企业家内野爱里脱下条纹纽扣衬衫，露出乳白色背心下的乳沟。

Such candidates represent Japan’s breed of populism, said Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo, adding that many of the “frivolouscandidates” don’t expect to win.“This is a day where notoriety is business,” Mr. Nakano said. “Having fame of any kind is going to lead to more business opportunities.”
东京上智大学的政治学家中野晃一说，这样的候选人代表了日本的民粹主义。他还说，许多“不正经候选人”并不指望获胜。“在这个时代，名声就是生意，”中野晃一说。“拥有任何形式的名气都会带来更多商机。”

The economic anxieties are adding to divisions between rural and urban dwellers, unskilled and college educated workers, religious traditionalists and secularists. In France, Italy, Germany and Sweden, far-right politicians have seized on this dissatisfaction to promote nationalist, anti-immigrant agendas.Protests have erupted in Greece, Portugal, Belgium and Germany this year. Outside Berlin in March, farmers spread manure on a highway, causing several crashes. In France, they burned hay, dumped manure in Nice’s City Hall and hung the carcass of a wild boar outside a labor inspection office in Agen.
经济焦虑加剧了农村和城市居民、非技术工人和受过大学教育的工人、宗教传统主义者和世俗主义者之间的分歧。在法国、意大利、德国和瑞典，极右翼政客利用这种不满情绪来推动民族主义、反移民议程。希腊、葡萄牙、比利时和德国今年都爆发了抗议活动。今年3月，农民将粪肥撒在柏林郊外的高速公路上，引发了几起车祸。法国的农民焚烧干草，在尼斯市政厅外倾倒粪肥，在阿让的一家劳动监察办公室外悬挂一头野猪尸体。

A special prosecutor appointed by the antidoping agency, known as WADA, to review its decision said he had found that the agency made an “indisputably reasonable” decision not to impose penalties on the swimmers, and concluded that the agency had not shown preferential treatment to China.But in an annex to his report, the prosecutor noted that two top scientists at the agency said they had difficulty believing China’s claim that the swimmers had been unwittingly contaminated.
世界反兴奋剂机构任命的一名特别检察官负责审查其决定，他表示，他认为该机构令这些游泳运动员免受处罚是一个“无可争议的合理”决定，并得出结论，认为该机构没有偏袒中国。但在其报告的附件中，检察官指出，该机构的两名顶级科学家表示，他们很难相信中国声称游泳运动员是在无意中受到污染的说法。

Mr. Biden will greet the leaders in the vast Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium a few blocks from the White House on Tuesday night — the same room where the treaty creating NATO was signed in 1949, in a ceremony presided over by President Harry S. Truman. Mr. Biden was 6 years old at the time, and the Cold War was in its infancy.He is now 81 and perhaps the most vocal advocate in Washington for an alliance that has grown from 12 members in 1949 to 32 today as the era of superpower conflict has roared back. 
周二晚，拜登将在距离白宫几个街区的巨大的安德鲁·梅隆礼堂欢迎各国领导人。创建北约的条约就是1949年在这个礼堂签署的，主持签约仪式的是杜鲁门总统。拜登当时只有六岁，冷战才刚刚开始。拜登现已81岁，他也许是美国政府中最为坚定的北约倡导者，随着超级大国冲突的时代回归，该组织已从1949年的12个成员国增加到今天的32个。

They hugged and strolled under the trees. They sipped tea and exchanged thoughts for hours. They petted horses together at the stables.At the Kremlin on Tuesday, Mr. Putin awarded Mr. Modi the Order of St. Andrew, the Russian government’s highest civilian honor, expressing “sincere gratitude” for his contribution to relations between their states.That’s a really sad commentary on Russia’s continued geopolitical weight.Would you rather be completely dependent on the United States or Russia, or have a position of maneuverability between the two?
他们拥抱在一起，在树下散步。他们喝着茶交流思想，一聊就是几个小时。他们一起在马厩里抚摸着马匹。 周二，普京将俄罗斯政府的最高民事荣誉圣安德列勋章授予莫迪，对他为两国关系做出的贡献表示“衷心感谢”。这是俄罗斯持续地缘政治影响力的一个令人痛心的注解。你愿意完全依赖美国或俄罗斯，还是在两者之间找一个灵活机动的位置？

Chinese investment has proved critical since support from the United States tapered off after the war in neighboring Afghanistan ended in 2021.Already, the security situation appears to have dampened Beijing’s confidence in investing in Pakistan. 
中国的投资对巴基斯坦至关重要，因为自美国2021年从邻国阿富汗撤军以来，美国对巴基斯坦的援助已逐渐减少。这种安全局面似乎已削弱了中国政府对在巴基斯坦投资的信心。

The 2,100-mile border separating India and China passes through some of the world’s most inhospitable terrain. In the west, it runs along India’s Ladakh region, at an altitude of 13,000 to 20,000 feet. During the months when the area isn’t covered in snow, the ground resembles a moonscape. The earth is sandy, strewn with rocks and pebbles; not a blade of grass grows anywhere; there are no visible signs of animal life. In winter, temperatures can drop to –40 degrees. The bleak conditions and barren vistas can induce despair in those who set foot on the land. 
印度与中国之间长约3300公里的边界线穿越世界上一些最荒凉的地带。西部边界延伸在印度的拉达克地区，海拔在4000至6000多米之间，在没有积雪的月份，那里的地貌看上去与月球表面差不多。土地是沙质的，遍布着岩石和砾石，寸草不生，看不到有任何动物生活在这里的迹象。冬天的气温能降到零下40度。荒凉和贫瘠的景观，让踏上那片土地的人感到绝望。

The Chinese government said it would start a food-safety investigation after public outrage followed a news report that a tanker truck carried liquefied coal and was then immediately used to transport cooking oil.In the past two decades, China has repeatedly dealt with food safety concerns, including infant formula laced with melamine and cooking oil being recycled for continued use, a practice commonly known as using “gutter oil.”
中国政府表示将启动一项食品安全调查，此前有媒体报道称，一辆刚卸完煤制油的罐车立即被用来运输食用油，引起了公众的愤怒。在过去的二十年里，中国多次出现食品安全问题，包括含三聚氰胺的婴儿配方奶粉，以及食用油被回收继续使用，俗称“地沟油”。

We must consistently adhere to the strictest standards, the strictest supervision, the harshest penalties, and the most serious accountability, without any slackening or complacency at any time.
要一以贯之坚持最严谨的标准、最严格的监督、最严厉的处罚、最严肃的问责，丝毫不可懈怠、时刻不能放松

China has repeatedly rejected accusations from Washington and other Western governments that its trade with Russia amounts to backing Mr. Putin’s war in Ukraine.It’s brimming with prejudice, smears and provocation, It is a major departure for NATO, which until 2019 never officially mentioned China as a concern, and then only in the blandest of language.
中国一再否认来自华盛顿和其他西方政府的指控，即中俄贸易等同于支持普京的乌克兰战争。涉华内容充满偏见、抹黑和挑衅，这对北约来说是一个重大的转变，直到2019年，北约才正式提到中国是一个担忧，而且仅用最为温和的措辞。

The Biden administration took steps on Wednesday to prevent China from circumventing American tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum by routing those imports through Mexico.The administration said it would impose tariffs on imports of Mexican metals that are partially made in China. American officials said the move would close a trade loophole that has allowed cheap, state-subsidized Chinese metals to circumvent existing U.S. tariffs.
拜登政府周三采取措施，防止中国通过向墨西哥出口钢铝来规避美国对中国征收的关税。政府表示，将对部分在中国制造的墨西哥金属进口征收关税。美国官员表示，此举将填补得到国家补贴的廉价中国金属绕过美国现有关税这一贸易漏洞。

Mexican aluminum coming into the United States will face a tariff of 10 percent if it contains metal that has been smelted or cast in China, Belarus, Iran or Russia.The United States will now impose a 25 percent tariff on Mexican steel that is melted or poured outside of North America before being turned into a finished product. Previously, that steel would have entered the country duty free.
进入美国的墨西哥铝材中如含有在中国、白俄罗斯、伊朗或俄罗斯冶炼或铸造的金属，将面临10%的关税。现在，美国将对在北美以外地区熔化或浇铸后变为成品的墨西哥钢铁征收25%的关税。在此之前，这些钢材是免税进入美国的。

In today’s interconnected economy, such overcapacity can also lead to the concentration of supply chains in ways that ultimately reduce economic resilience,While periodic surpluses can occur within natural business cycles, we are concerned about structural overcapacity, which stems from persistent patterns of overinvestment and is facilitated by extensive state support.
在当今互联互通的经济中，这种产能过剩也可能导致供应链的集中，最终削弱经济韧性，虽然周期性盈余可能出现在自然的商业周期中，但我们担心的是结构性产能过剩，这源于持续的过度投资模式，并得到了政府的广泛支持。

Days after President Biden said only the “Lord Almighty” could drive him from the race, he laid out a far more earthly scenario at his closely watched news conference on Thursday night: His advisers would have to prove to him that he was headed for certain defeat.But leaning into the microphone and whispering to dramatize his defiance, Mr. Biden made clear that he did not foresee this happening.
几天前，拜登总统刚刚说过只有“全能天主”能让他退出竞选，周四晚的一场受到密切关注的新闻发布会上，他勾勒出了一个没那么虚无缥缈的场景：他的顾问们需要向他证明此次必输无疑才行。但当他俯身靠近话筒，用低语来强调他拒不服从的姿态时，拜登明确表示，他不认为他们能做到。

The high-stakes, mostly unscripted hour — Mr. Biden’s longest since the debate that sent his candidacy into a tailspin — came as some of those around him have talked about how to persuade him to drop out
这场持续一小时的新闻发布会事关重大，基本上没有经过事先的编排——这是在因辩论会表现不佳导致竞选形势急剧恶化后拜登第一次有这样的露面。此前他身边的人纷纷开始谈论如何说服他退出

On Thursday, Mr. Biden at times flashed his rising frustration with those paid to help him, blaming staff members directly for his overstuffed schedule and obliquely for some of the recent reporting on his candidacy.They have a sitting president who is no longer capable of winning re-election or even proving to the public he can do the job effectively
周四，拜登屡次表达他对那些受雇于他的助手越来越强烈的不满，他直言幕僚把日程表排得过满，并隐晦地说近来一些有关他的竞选的报道也难辞其咎。他们现在有一个在任总统，但无法取得连任，甚至无法向公众证明他可以有效地完成工作

By the time Mr. Biden finished his first solo news conference this year, Republicans seemed more pleased with his steady showing — hoping a wounded Mr. Biden would soldier on — than Democrats were. Many in the party now worry that every unscripted Biden appearance through November will be a hold-your-breath moment.
这是拜登本年度的第一场独自进行的新闻发布会，到了发布会结束之时，对于他的稳定表现，似乎共和党人比民主党人还要满意，他们希望拜登能咬牙挺过去。民主党内许多人担心，从现在起一直到11月，拜登的每一次未经事先安排的露面，都将令人神经紧绷。

The post-debate problem is how closely everyone is paying attention, magnifying every mumble and mistake.And the news conference was far from flawless. Mr. Biden flubbed the very first answer, referring to “Vice President Trump” instead of Vice President Kamala Harris. He cut himself off more than once.How can I say this without sounding too self-serving?
辩论后产生的问题是，现在每个人都在密切关注，放大他的每一次口齿不清和错误。这次新闻发布会远非完美无瑕。拜登的第一个回答就出现了失误，他说“特朗普副总统”，而不是卡玛拉·哈里斯副总统。他不止一次说话磕磕绊绊。我该怎么说才不会听起来显得对自己太有利呢？

The news conference resulted in a bizarre and bipartisan symmetry on social media, where Republicans and White House aides were both celebrating Mr. Biden’s performance — albeit for wildly different reasons.“Joe Biden is crushing it. Build Back Better,” Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist who hopes to become secretary of state, wrote in a post dripping with sarcasm.“Tonight President Biden was knowledgeable, engaging, and capable,”
新闻发布会在社交媒体上形成了一种奇怪的两党一致，共和党人和白宫助手都在欢庆拜登的表现——尽管原因截然不同。“乔·拜登表现出众。卷土重来。”希望成为国务卿的特朗普忠实支持者理查德·格雷内尔在一篇充满讽刺的帖子中写道。“今晚，拜登总统表现出了博学多才，他引人瞩目、能力出众，”

Germany, which accounts for roughly a quarter of mobile customers in the European Union, is highly dependent on the Chinese export market and has long delayed taking such a drastic step against Chinese firms. Instead it has chosen to certify components based on a case-by-case security check.In presenting the arrangement, Ms. Faeser reiterated that it was based on negotiations with German telecom providers. Those providers had long argued that switching from Huawei and ZTE components too quickly would be complicated and expensive.
德国约占欧盟移动用户的四分之一，它的出口高度依赖中国市场，长期以来一直推迟对中国公司采取如此激烈的措施，而是选择根据个案情况进行安全检查，对零部件进行认证。在介绍相关安排时，费泽重申，这是基于与德国电信供应商的谈判达成的协议。这些供应商长期以来一直提出过快地从华为和中兴通讯零部件切换过来会很复杂，而且成本高昂。
