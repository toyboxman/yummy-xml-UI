In a social media post, he compared Mr. Biden to Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor who “screwed up his succession by passing the baton to his feckless son Commodus, whose disastrous rule started Rome’s decline.”“It’s important to manage one’s ride into the sunset,” Mr. Sikorski added.
他在社交媒体上发帖，将拜登与罗马皇帝马可·奥勒留相提并论，他写道，奥勒留“把接力棒交给了无能的儿子康茂德，搞砸了自己的权力交接，康茂德的灾难性统治开启了罗马的衰落”。“安排好暮年的最后一段工作，这非常重要，”西科尔斯基写道。

With cash for clunkers, the government pushes consumers to buy from big manufacturing industries. But in cities like Jingdezhen, a pottery-making hub for more than 1,000 years, there are hints that China’s consumers would spend more if the government gave them cash instead and let them choose how to spend it.
政府通过以旧换新鼓励消费者购买大型制造业的产品。但在景德镇这样的城市，已有迹象表明，如果政府直接把现金交给消费者，让他们选择如何花钱的话，中国消费者们花钱的意愿会更高。景德镇是有1000多年历史的陶瓷制造中心。

In broader terms, however, Russia’s participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is largely a rear-guard action to counterbalance the region’s seemingly inexorable shift toward China. Instead, the Kremlin has sought to maintain a measure of leverage in its former satellites on issues that remain vital to its national interests, including by attending largely symbolic events like the Astana summit. 
然而，从更广泛的角度来看，俄罗斯加入上海合作组织在很大程度上是一种防卫行动，以制衡该地区似乎不可阻挡地向中国倾斜的趋势。相反，克里姆林宫试图在对其国家利益至关重要的问题上，对俄罗斯的前卫星国保持一定程度的影响力，包括参加阿斯塔纳峰会等主要是象征性的活动。

Censors have meticulously scrubbed and limited online discussions of the dispute — a level of censorship experts say is rare outside the most politically sensitive topics.
审查人员细致地过滤和限制了网上对这一争议的讨论——专家们表示，这种程度的审查很少见于最敏感的政治话题之外。

The bigger news, though, might be what officials were wearing at the meeting in Pyongyang, the capital: chest pins bearing Mr. Kim’s image, according to photos released through state media.By introducing a pin of his own image, Mr. Kim is elevating his idolization and the personality cult surrounding him to match the level reserved, until now, only for his grandfather
但更大的新闻也许是出席这个在首都平壤召开的会议的官员们佩戴的东西：据朝鲜官媒发布的照片​​，他们胸前都佩戴着金正恩像章。韩国官员和分析人士称，金正恩推出自己的像章，是将对他的个人崇拜和迷信提升到了此前保留给金日成和金正日的水平。

Under Mr. Kim, North Korea has conducted four underground nuclear tests and developed a fleet of missiles, including long-range rockets able to reach the continental United States. Mr. Kim has tried to reinvent his family’s rule, casting himself as a young, energetic and even transformative leader. He has emphasized his family lineage by dressing like his grandfather, but has also appeared to distance himself from his forebears in an effort to move out of their long shadows and show that he is a worthy leader in his own right.
在金正恩的领导下，朝鲜已经进行了四次地下核试验，研发出一系列的导弹，包括能够打击美国本土的远程导弹。金正恩试图以新形式展现金氏统治，将自己塑造为一名年轻、精力充沛，甚至具有变革精神的领导人。他用祖父风格的穿着来强调自己的家族血统，但同时似乎也想与先辈保持距离，努力摆脱他们长长的影子，让自己看起来是一名值得尊敬的领导人。

Russia’s state-owned Channel One covered the debate in depth, describing President Biden and Donald Trump as “small children from the nursery.” As Russian viewers were treated to replays of the candidates bickering over who was the better golfer, the presenter predicted that life itself in America would become “one never-ending game of golf,” with the United States lurching “from one big hole to the next.”
作为俄罗斯的国家电视台，第一频道深入报道了这场辩论，将拜登和特朗普描述为“托儿所里的小孩”。随着电视台将两名候选人争论谁的高尔夫打得更好的片段重放给俄罗斯观众，主持人预言，随着美国“从一个大洞滚向另一个大洞”，美国人的生活将变成“一场没完没了的高尔夫球运动”。

They have tried to plant the idea among their own people and their sympathizers in the West and developing nations that the United States is not a democracy at all but a dysfunctional oligarchy in terminal decline.
他们试图在本国人民，以及他们在西方和发展中国家的同情者当中灌输一个观念：美国根本就不民主，而是机能失调的寡头政治，正在无可挽回地走向衰落。

Their tactics may be effective in the short term. Prophecies of America’s implosion have already fed anxiety among U.S. partners and allies. European leaders live in dread of a potential Trump-led American undermining of NATO, trying desperately to Trump-proof Europe against such an unfortunate eventuality by developing an E.U.-wide defense industrial strategy and considering whether to appoint an E.U. defense commissioner. 
策略也许在短期内有效。美国崩溃的预言已在美国的伙伴和盟友中加剧了焦虑感。欧洲领导人们整天提心吊胆，生怕美国可能在特朗普领导下削弱北约，他们正在迫不及待地试图防止欧洲在美国大选出现不幸结局的情况下遭受特朗普上台的影响，做法包括发展欧盟范围的国防工业战略，以及考虑是否任命一名欧盟国防专员。

A deeper question is embedded in the doubts America’s adversaries are sowing. If the two leading presidential candidates have nothing better to do than to spar over who is the better golfer, where does this leave America’s vision for the world? Is America still the shining city upon a hill, or is its prolonged political malaise a sign that something is burning down?
一个更深层次的问题镶嵌在美国的对手们正在散布的疑虑中。如果这两名主要的总统候选人除了争论谁的高尔夫打得更好之外无事可做的话，这对美国的世界视野来说意味着什么？美国仍是耀眼的山巅之城吗？还是其长期的政治问题预示着内部已有将其焚毁的火苗？

At the time, the Kremlin was certain that the world was going its way and sought to extend power and influence to far-flung corners of the world. The Soviets were all too keen to take advantage of America’s problems by advertising America’s high crime rates and rampant drug addiction. In the words of one Politburo document from 1971, the Soviet policy was to discredit the United States, “thus undermining the U.S. position as the leader of the bourgeois world.”
克里姆林宫当时曾确信，世界正在朝着它希望的方向发展，并试图将权力和影响力扩大到世界各个角落。苏联政府非常热衷于通过大肆宣扬美国的高犯罪率和吸毒泛滥来利用美国的问题。用1971年的一份政治局文件中的话说，苏联的政策是败坏美国的名声，“从而破坏美国作为资产阶级世界领袖的地位。”

Yes, America is at a low moment. And there may be darker days still ahead, with no promise of a quick resolution or even a smooth election this fall.But history has shown that resilience is built into the American system — through its institutional constraints, accountability and genuine, meaningful debate about the country’s direction. Amid all this turmoil, an American comeback still feels possible, even plausible. America in decline is America on the road to renewal.
是的，美国正处于低谷。美国未来也许还有更黑暗的日子，没有快速的解决方案，甚至不会有一场顺利的秋季大选。但历史已表明，通过其制度约束、问责制，以及对国家方向的真正的、有意义的辩论，美国的体制里嵌入了迅速恢复的能力。在面临所有这些动荡的时候，美国的复苏仍有可能，甚至合理。走向衰落的美国是正走在复兴之路上的美国。

If the backbone of a society is completely submerged by the tide of nationalism, the future fate of the country is predictable. In this grand drama that plays out every day, some are directors, some are actors, some set the stage while the others are the audience, He has become too deeply immersed in the play, finding it difficult to extricate himself
如果中流砥柱被民族主义大潮彻底淹没，那么这个国家的未来命运也可想而知, 这场天天都在上演的大戏中，有人是导演，有人是演员，有人是搭台的，有人是看戏的，而他，入戏太深，难以自拔。

That dizzying reversal of political fortunes speaks to the turmoil that has engulfed Britain since it voted to leave the European Union in 2016. Brexit fractured the Conservative Party, leaving it increasingly erratic and extreme, as it confronted the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic and a cost-of-living crisis. With Labour on the threshold of power, it faces hard trade-offs that reflect the fallout from those years: a country depleted, exhausted and desperate for change.
这种令人眼花缭乱的政治命运的逆转表明，自2016年投票退出欧盟以来，英国一直处于动荡之中。英国脱欧使保守党分裂，使其在面对新冠大流行和生活成本危机的挑战时变得越来越不稳定和极端。即将执政之际，工党面临着艰难的权衡，反映了那些年带来的影响和后果：一个资源枯竭、精疲力竭、迫切需要改变的国家。

Labour said it would also hire 8,500 health workers to treat patients with mental health issues, as well as doubling the number of C.T. scanners and M.R.I. machines in hospitals. It would finance this by closing a loophole for people who claim non-domiciled status in Britain, allowing them to avoid paying some taxes. But its immediate challenge would be to resolve a long-festering wage dispute with junior doctors.
工党表示，它还将雇用8500名医疗保健从业人员来治疗有精神健康问题的患者，并将医院的CT扫描仪和核磁共振仪的数量增加一倍。它将通过堵住非定居者逃税漏洞来为此筹集资金。但眼下的挑战将是解决与初级医生之间旷日持久的工资纠纷。

In the 1980s, a French punk rock band coined a rallying cry against the country’s far right that retained its punch over decades. The chant, still shouted at protests by the left, is “La jeunesse emmerde le Front National,” which cannot be translated well without curse words, but essentially tells the far right to get lost.
上世纪80年代，一支法国朋克摇滚乐队创造了反对该国极右翼的战斗口号，几十年来一直保持着冲击力。这句“La jeunesse emmerde le Front National”如今仍然是左翼人士在抗议时喊出的口号，如果不用脏话，就无法翻译出它的精髓，实际上，它的意思是让极右翼人士滚开。

Some people were openly hostile, crumpling the leaflets and angrily referring to the party’s antisemitic and racist past. “This, to me, is fascism,” one older man said in broken French, pointing to a leaflet featuring a beaming Mr. Bardella. “I don’t feel at home anymore,” Mr. Ludon said, referring to an influx of migrants. “Finding a French butcher has become hard.” Asked to elaborate, he said he meant a butcher that was not halal.
一些人公开表示敌意，把传单揉成一团，愤怒地提到该党的反犹和种族主义历史。“对我来说，这就是法西斯主义，”一名年长的男子指着一份印有笑容满面的巴尔德拉的传单，用蹩脚的法语说。“我再也没有家的感觉了，”卢东在谈到移民潮的时候说。“找一个法国屠夫都变得很难。”当被要求详细说明时，他说他指的是非清真的屠夫。

It is just that chumminess, and the far-right agenda he is working to humanize, that frightens many young people from immigrant backgrounds or who belong to ethnic minorities.“Even before these results, people were attacked, insulted and spit on,” said Mariam Touré, 22, a law student and community activist who was at the event. Her family fled civil war in Ivory Coast in 2003 and arrived in France in 2009.“At the same time,” she added, her voice cracking, “I am very scared.”
正是这种和蔼可亲的态度，以及他正在努力使之人性化的极右翼议程，让许多有移民背景或属于少数族裔的年轻人感到害怕。“甚至在这些结果出来之前，人们就遭到了攻击、侮辱和唾骂，”在场的22岁的法律系学生、社区活动人士玛丽亚姆·图雷说。她的家人于2003年逃离科特迪瓦内战，于2009年来到了法国。“与此同时，”她声音沙哑地补充道，“我非常害怕。”

Influential voices in his own party have called for him to step aside. Polls indicate that many voters hope he will. Yet so far, he is staying the course.There’s a formal name for this trap: escalation of commitment to a losing course of action. In the face of impending failure, extensive evidence shows, instead of rethinking our plans, we often double down on our decisions. It feels better to be a fighter than a quitter.
党内有影响力的声音要求他让位。民意调查显示，许多选民也希望他会这样做。然而到目前为止，他仍在坚持。这样的陷阱有一个正式的名字：对正在失败的行为做出承诺升级。大量的证据表明，面对即将到来的失败，我们往往不是重新考虑计划，而是为这个计划加倍努力。做斗士比做放弃者感觉更好。

One of the tragedies of the human condition is that we use our big brains not to make rational decisions but rather to rationalize the decisions we’ve already made. We stick around too long in dead-end jobs. We stay in unhappy marriages even after friends have counseled us to leave. We stand by candidates even after they violate our principles.
人类的悲剧之一在于，我们的大脑不是用来做出理性的决定，而是用来把已经做出的决定合理化。我们在没有前途的职位上苦苦坚持。即使朋友劝告，我们也会维持不幸福的婚姻。即使候选人违反了我们的原则，我们也会支持他们。
