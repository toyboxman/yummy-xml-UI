It is possible, however, that the actual attack was not filmed, as drooping tree branches appear to block any view of the site from nearby surveillance cameras.
但一个可能性是，并未拍到实际的袭击过程，因为现场附近的监控摄像头被下垂的树枝阻挡住了。

It’s a veritable Hollywood movie. Women are scripting what will happen to Trump, who has treated women with such cruelty and contempt.And Trump will have to build an annex, maybe to his frontal or occipital lobe, to accommodate the sorority.
这是一部名副其实的好莱坞电影。女人们正在构思特朗普的下场，他曾如此残忍和轻蔑地对待女性。特朗普得盖一座附属建筑，才能装得下这个姐妹会，可能是在他的额叶或是枕叶里。

Who do you suppose was tasked with taking on that male vanity? Women! Jill Biden was exhorted to make everything right. Or it was Valerie Biden’s job. Or Pelosi’s. Hunter Biden was reportedly hunkered down with Dad, but did anyone demand that he tame the paterfamilias? Not that I heard or read. Women were given the heaping measure of responsibility, though they often get only a soupçon of credit.
你觉得是谁承担了应对男人虚荣心的任务？女人！人们劝吉尔·拜登来解决这个难题。或者，这项工作要由瓦莱丽·拜登来做。要由佩洛西来做。据报道，亨特·拜登一直和父亲在一起，但是有人要求他说服“老爷子”吗？我没有听说过，也没有读到过。女人承担了大量的责任，尽管她们往往分不到什么功劳。

These tests would include blood cell counts, basic bodily chemistries (such as sodium and potassium levels) and electrocardiograms. These results are helpful because they can suggest major diseases that have not yet been identified.
这类检验包括血细胞计数、基础生化（例如钠和钾的水平）和心电图指标。这些检验的结果可以揭示一些尚未发现的重大疾病，因此是有帮助的。

There are talented politicians, there are untalented politicians, and then there’s JD Vance — I mean, he tried to calm the furor over his “childless cat ladies” remarks by feebly deadpanning that he’s “got nothing against cats.”
这世上的政治人物，有的才华横溢，有的平庸无能，还有第三种，叫JD·万斯——怎么说呢，当初“不养孩子只养猫的女人”的言论引发众怒，他为了打圆场，弱弱地说了个冷笑话，说他“对猫没意见”。

Mr. Hu’s post soon disappeared from Weibo, but not before it set off a kerfuffle.Market-oriented reform is simply less of a priority for the leadership now compared to 2013 against the rising importance of self-reliance, national security and state control
胡锡进的帖子很快就从微博上消失了，但引发了一场轩然大波。与2013年相比，在自力更生、国家安全和国家控制的重要性日益上升的背景下，以市场为导向的改革对领导层来说并不是优先事项。

The wild swings in markets recently are a case study in how seemingly distinct pillars around the globe are connected through the financial system — and the domino effect that can follow if one of them falls.
最近市场的剧烈波动可谓一个活生生的例子，说明了全球各地看起来截然不同的支柱是如何通过金融体系联系在一起的，以及如果其中一个支柱倒下，可能随之而来的多米诺骨牌效应。

Factors like a slow buildup of risky bets, the sudden undoing of a popular way to fund such trades and diverging decisions by global policymakers are each playing a role. Some of these forces can be traced back years, while others emerged only recently.
高风险押注的缓慢积累、为此类交易融资的一种常用方式的突然崩塌，以及全球政策制定者的决策分歧等因素都起到了作用。其中一些因素可以追溯到几年前，还有一些则是最近才出现的。

While it was under construction, the company sent American engineers to Tainan for training and to shadow their Taiwanese counterparts, observing TSMC’s all-hands-on-deck way of working up close.
在建设期间，该公司派美国工程师到台南接受培训，让他们跟随台湾同行近距离观察台积电全员齐心协力的工作方式。

The hiccups getting the livestream going renewed questions about X’s ability to handle high-profile events. Without providing evidence, Mr. Musk blamed the snafu on a “massive” distributed denial of service attack, a type of cyberattack that uses floods of malicious web traffic to overwhelm sites and knock them offline.
直播过程中出现的小问题再次令人们质疑X处理受到高度关注活动的能力。马斯克在没有提供证据的情况下将这次混乱归咎于“大规模的”分布式拒绝服务攻击，这是一种利用大量恶意网络流量令网站过载并使其下线的网络攻击。

The slice of the Himalayas where many Chinese villages have sprung up has been largely uninhabited for good reason. Its rocky, icy terrain is particularly forbidding in winter, with roads buried many months of the year by deep snow. The air is thin and cold. The land is barren, making farming difficult.
喜马拉雅山脉的这片地区涌现出了许多中国村庄，但此前这里大部分地区无人居住，这是有原因的。这里多岩石和冰雪覆盖的地形在冬季尤其险峻，一年中有好几个月道路都被厚厚的积雪覆盖。空气稀薄而寒冷。土地贫瘠，难以耕种。

Lilibet speaks good English. Her coach is British and amply tattooed. She competed on Tuesday in park skateboarding, an insurgent sport in which the point among the sisterhood of athletes is not just winning a medal but embodying a mantra of female empowerment.
莉莉白能说一口流利的英语。她的教练是一个身上有很多文身的英国人。周二，她参加了公园滑板项目的比赛，这是一项新兴的运动，运动员之间姐妹情谊的意义不仅在于赢得奖牌，还体现了女性赋权的口号。

For now though, life is mostly peaceful and slow on the island. Small wooden fishing boats line a white sand beach on the eastern shore. Rough houses pieced together from plywood, scrap lumber and tarps are the main form of shelter. On a recent evening, a few people gathered near the beach to debone fish, while others waded into tide pools with fishing spears.
不过，目前岛上的生活基本是平静而又缓慢的。小型木制渔船沿着东岸的白色沙滩停靠。用胶合板、废木料和防水布拼凑起来的简陋房屋是主要的居所。不久前的一个晚上，几个人聚集在海滩附近剔鱼骨，还有人拿着鱼叉涉入潮池

They have disrupted oil-and-gas prospecting, destroyed coral reefs to build artificial islands and chased Southeast Asian civilian fleets from traditional fishing grounds.
他们中断了油气勘探，为建造人工岛破坏了珊瑚礁，还把在传统渔场打渔的东南亚国家民用船队驱赶出去

The school is in one of Foshan’s oldest neighborhoods, where thick banyan trees dangle aerial roots over sidewalks and streets.Mr. Walz soon settled into the cocoon of daily life on a small-town campus
佛山一中位于该市一个历史最悠久的社区，繁茂的榕树垂下气生根，将那里的人行道和街头覆盖。沃尔兹很快适应了小镇校园的日常生活

The students, most of whom had never traveled abroad, barely spent any time in the classroom. In addition to sightseeing, they met with tai chi masters, practiced their chopstick skills at family-style meals and tried Chinese calligraphy.
这些学生中的大多数从未出过国，在中国的时候，他们把时间几乎都花在了课堂之外。除了观光，他们还去见了太极拳师傅，在中国家宴式的场合练习用筷子，还尝试写毛笔字。

That Olympic spirit is supposed to float somehow in a bubble above the cut-and-thrust of global politics.We should not make the mistake to raise ourselves to referees of political disputes because we will be crushed by these political powers.
奥林匹克精神本应像一个气泡，以某种方式漂浮在全球政治的刀光剑影之上。我们不应该错误地把自己当作政治争端的裁判，因为我们会被这些政治力量压垮

It’s a fallacy, of course, that politics and sports exist in separate spheres, and even the I.O.C. admits it. How could they not be conjoined when the Games depend on nationhood as an organizing principle of competition? Patriotism is only a punch or a paddle away from jingoism.
当然，认为政治和体育存在于不同的领域，这是一种谬论，甚至国际奥委会也承认这一点。既然运动会以国家身份作为竞赛的组织原则，它们怎么可能不被结合在一起呢？爱国主义与好战主义只差一拳或是一桨。

A gold medalist diver’s mother said she was afraid for her daughter to come home after their hometown was swarmed with her supporters. A champion swimmer whose hotel was staked out by admirers disbanded his official fan group and told an interviewer he would rather have performed worse if it meant he would be left alone.
一名获得金牌的跳水运动员的母亲说，她不敢让女儿回家，因为老家挤满了女儿的粉丝。一名游泳冠军住的酒店被崇拜者长时间包围后，他解散了自己的官方粉丝团，并在接受采访时说，如果能清净一点，宁愿这次成绩没有那么优秀。
