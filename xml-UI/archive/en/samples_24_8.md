Who do you suppose was tasked with taking on that male vanity? Women! Jill Biden was exhorted to make everything right. Or it was Valerie Biden’s job. Or Pelosi’s. Hunter Biden was reportedly hunkered down with Dad, but did anyone demand that he tame the paterfamilias? Not that I heard or read. Women were given the heaping measure of responsibility, though they often get only a soupçon of credit.
你觉得是谁承担了应对男人虚荣心的任务？女人！人们劝吉尔·拜登来解决这个难题。或者，这项工作要由瓦莱丽·拜登来做。要由佩洛西来做。据报道，亨特·拜登一直和父亲在一起，但是有人要求他说服“老爷子”吗？我没有听说过，也没有读到过。女人承担了大量的责任，尽管她们往往分不到什么功劳。

It is possible, however, that the actual attack was not filmed, as drooping tree branches appear to block any view of the site from nearby surveillance cameras.
但一个可能性是，并未拍到实际的袭击过程，因为现场附近的监控摄像头被下垂的树枝阻挡住了。

It’s a veritable Hollywood movie. Women are scripting what will happen to Trump, who has treated women with such cruelty and contempt.And Trump will have to build an annex, maybe to his frontal or occipital lobe, to accommodate the sorority.
这是一部名副其实的好莱坞电影。女人们正在构思特朗普的下场，他曾如此残忍和轻蔑地对待女性。特朗普得盖一座附属建筑，才能装得下这个姐妹会，可能是在他的额叶或是枕叶里。

These tests would include blood cell counts, basic bodily chemistries (such as sodium and potassium levels) and electrocardiograms. These results are helpful because they can suggest major diseases that have not yet been identified.
这类检验包括血细胞计数、基础生化（例如钠和钾的水平）和心电图指标。这些检验的结果可以揭示一些尚未发现的重大疾病，因此是有帮助的。

There are talented politicians, there are untalented politicians, and then there’s JD Vance — I mean, he tried to calm the furor over his “childless cat ladies” remarks by feebly deadpanning that he’s “got nothing against cats.”
这世上的政治人物，有的才华横溢，有的平庸无能，还有第三种，叫JD·万斯——怎么说呢，当初“不养孩子只养猫的女人”的言论引发众怒，他为了打圆场，弱弱地说了个冷笑话，说他“对猫没意见”。

Mr. Hu’s post soon disappeared from Weibo, but not before it set off a kerfuffle.Market-oriented reform is simply less of a priority for the leadership now compared to 2013 against the rising importance of self-reliance, national security and state control
胡锡进的帖子很快就从微博上消失了，但引发了一场轩然大波。与2013年相比，在自力更生、国家安全和国家控制的重要性日益上升的背景下，以市场为导向的改革对领导层来说并不是优先事项。

The wild swings in markets recently are a case study in how seemingly distinct pillars around the globe are connected through the financial system — and the domino effect that can follow if one of them falls.
最近市场的剧烈波动可谓一个活生生的例子，说明了全球各地看起来截然不同的支柱是如何通过金融体系联系在一起的，以及如果其中一个支柱倒下，可能随之而来的多米诺骨牌效应。

Factors like a slow buildup of risky bets, the sudden undoing of a popular way to fund such trades and diverging decisions by global policymakers are each playing a role. Some of these forces can be traced back years, while others emerged only recently.
高风险押注的缓慢积累、为此类交易融资的一种常用方式的突然崩塌，以及全球政策制定者的决策分歧等因素都起到了作用。其中一些因素可以追溯到几年前，还有一些则是最近才出现的。

While it was under construction, the company sent American engineers to Tainan for training and to shadow their Taiwanese counterparts, observing TSMC’s all-hands-on-deck way of working up close.
在建设期间，该公司派美国工程师到台南接受培训，让他们跟随台湾同行近距离观察台积电全员齐心协力的工作方式。

The hiccups getting the livestream going renewed questions about X’s ability to handle high-profile events. Without providing evidence, Mr. Musk blamed the snafu on a “massive” distributed denial of service attack, a type of cyberattack that uses floods of malicious web traffic to overwhelm sites and knock them offline.
直播过程中出现的小问题再次令人们质疑X处理受到高度关注活动的能力。马斯克在没有提供证据的情况下将这次混乱归咎于“大规模的”分布式拒绝服务攻击，这是一种利用大量恶意网络流量令网站过载并使其下线的网络攻击。

The slice of the Himalayas where many Chinese villages have sprung up has been largely uninhabited for good reason. Its rocky, icy terrain is particularly forbidding in winter, with roads buried many months of the year by deep snow. The air is thin and cold. The land is barren, making farming difficult.
喜马拉雅山脉的这片地区涌现出了许多中国村庄，但此前这里大部分地区无人居住，这是有原因的。这里多岩石和冰雪覆盖的地形在冬季尤其险峻，一年中有好几个月道路都被厚厚的积雪覆盖。空气稀薄而寒冷。土地贫瘠，难以耕种。

Lilibet speaks good English. Her coach is British and amply tattooed. She competed on Tuesday in park skateboarding, an insurgent sport in which the point among the sisterhood of athletes is not just winning a medal but embodying a mantra of female empowerment.
莉莉白能说一口流利的英语。她的教练是一个身上有很多文身的英国人。周二，她参加了公园滑板项目的比赛，这是一项新兴的运动，运动员之间姐妹情谊的意义不仅在于赢得奖牌，还体现了女性赋权的口号。

For now though, life is mostly peaceful and slow on the island. Small wooden fishing boats line a white sand beach on the eastern shore. Rough houses pieced together from plywood, scrap lumber and tarps are the main form of shelter. On a recent evening, a few people gathered near the beach to debone fish, while others waded into tide pools with fishing spears.
不过，目前岛上的生活基本是平静而又缓慢的。小型木制渔船沿着东岸的白色沙滩停靠。用胶合板、废木料和防水布拼凑起来的简陋房屋是主要的居所。不久前的一个晚上，几个人聚集在海滩附近剔鱼骨，还有人拿着鱼叉涉入潮池

They have disrupted oil-and-gas prospecting, destroyed coral reefs to build artificial islands and chased Southeast Asian civilian fleets from traditional fishing grounds.
他们中断了油气勘探，为建造人工岛破坏了珊瑚礁，还把在传统渔场打渔的东南亚国家民用船队驱赶出去

The school is in one of Foshan’s oldest neighborhoods, where thick banyan trees dangle aerial roots over sidewalks and streets.Mr. Walz soon settled into the cocoon of daily life on a small-town campus
佛山一中位于该市一个历史最悠久的社区，繁茂的榕树垂下气生根，将那里的人行道和街头覆盖。沃尔兹很快适应了小镇校园的日常生活

The students, most of whom had never traveled abroad, barely spent any time in the classroom. In addition to sightseeing, they met with tai chi masters, practiced their chopstick skills at family-style meals and tried Chinese calligraphy.
这些学生中的大多数从未出过国，在中国的时候，他们把时间几乎都花在了课堂之外。除了观光，他们还去见了太极拳师傅，在中国家宴式的场合练习用筷子，还尝试写毛笔字。

That Olympic spirit is supposed to float somehow in a bubble above the cut-and-thrust of global politics.We should not make the mistake to raise ourselves to referees of political disputes because we will be crushed by these political powers.
奥林匹克精神本应像一个气泡，以某种方式漂浮在全球政治的刀光剑影之上。我们不应该错误地把自己当作政治争端的裁判，因为我们会被这些政治力量压垮

It’s a fallacy, of course, that politics and sports exist in separate spheres, and even the I.O.C. admits it. How could they not be conjoined when the Games depend on nationhood as an organizing principle of competition? Patriotism is only a punch or a paddle away from jingoism.
当然，认为政治和体育存在于不同的领域，这是一种谬论，甚至国际奥委会也承认这一点。既然运动会以国家身份作为竞赛的组织原则，它们怎么可能不被结合在一起呢？爱国主义与好战主义只差一拳或是一桨。

A gold medalist diver’s mother said she was afraid for her daughter to come home after their hometown was swarmed with her supporters. A champion swimmer whose hotel was staked out by admirers disbanded his official fan group and told an interviewer he would rather have performed worse if it meant he would be left alone.
一名获得金牌的跳水运动员的母亲说，她不敢让女儿回家，因为老家挤满了女儿的粉丝。一名游泳冠军住的酒店被崇拜者长时间包围后，他解散了自己的官方粉丝团，并在接受采访时说，如果能清净一点，宁愿这次成绩没有那么优秀。

Over the past decade, during which China doled out more lending than the Paris Club — a grouping of 22 of the world’s largest creditor nations — the total value of interest payments of the 75 poorest countries in the world have quadrupled and will outstrip their total annual spending on health, education and infrastructure combined, according to the World Bank.
据世界银行的数据，中国在过去十年发放的贷款超过了由22个世界上最大的债权国组成的巴黎俱乐部发放的贷款总额，而世界上75个最贫穷国家为中国贷款支付的利息总额在这十年中已增长至以前的四倍，并将超过这些国家在医疗、教育和基础设施方面的年度总支出。

Ms. Su began vlogging after she set out from her home in Zhengzhou, a city in central China, in September 2020. In between shots of turquoise lakes and rolling fields, she explained why she, a retired factory worker with a high school education, had finally struck out on her own. She was tired of living for others, bearing her husband’s demands and shouldering housework. For decades, she had believed that was just how life was for women, but now she was finally ready for a change.
2020年9月，苏敏从郑州的家中出发后，开始用视频博客记录旅程。视频中除了碧绿的湖泊和连绵起伏的田野外，还有她对自己为什么自驾游的解释。这名有高中文化程度的退休工人终于决定要自己独立出去。她厌倦了为他人活着，忍受丈夫的要求，承担家务劳动。几十年来，她曾一直认为那就是女性的生活，但现在她终于决定要摆脱那种生活。

Black Myth: Wukong is one of the most highly anticipated Chinese video games ever, a premium title with a blockbuster-worthy budget that underscores the country’s push to become a global cultural power.
《黑神话：悟空》是中国有史以来最受期待的电子游戏之一，这是一款拥有大片级预算的优质游戏，凸显了中国成为全球文化大国的努力。

The game’s release is a landmark moment for China’s gaming industry. It is considered China’s first “AAA” title, a big-budget, global game with sophisticated gameplay and advanced graphics. Chinese news media has reported it is one of the most expensive games ever developed there, with a budget exceeding $50 million.
对中国的游戏行业来说，这款游戏的发布是一个具有里程碑意义的时刻。它被视为中国的第一款3A游戏，也就是一款拥有复杂玩法和先进视觉效果的大预算全球游戏。据中国新闻媒体报道，这是中国有史以来开发成本最高的游戏之一，预算超过4亿元。

Black Myth: Wukong is based on a classic 16th-century Chinese novel called “Journey to the West.” The game’s protagonist is inspired by Sun Wukong, also known as the Monkey King, who fights opponents with a staff. Game Science also has the backing of Tencent Holdings
《黑神话：悟空》改编自16世纪的中国经典小说《西游记》。游戏主角的灵感来自孙悟空，也被称为美猴王，使用一根棍子与对手战斗。游戏科学还得到了腾讯控股的支持

India is now pursuing an aggressive campaign to catch up, readying plans for new ports while expanding existing docks. Whether those designs come to fruition and how quickly could shape the results of one of India’s grandest aspirations: swelling into a full-fledged manufacturing and export colossus.Dredging has to be done at Indian ports,China definitely has an edge over India.
印度目前正在采取措施积极赶上，在准备建设新港的同时扩建现有的码头。这些计划能否实现、实现的速度如何，将影响到印度最宏伟的抱负之一：将国家发展为一个成熟的制造业和出口巨头。印度港口必须进行疏浚，中国肯定比印度有优势

Like port overseers on every shore, Mr. Wagh, who runs the port authority in Navi Mumbai, is frustrated by the parts of his business that he does not control: congested and bumpy highways that slow the movement of cargo, for instance, and a train system that has traditionally prioritized the moving of passengers.
和各地的港口监管者一样，管理新孟买港务局的瓦格对那些自己无能为力的事感到沮丧：比如，拥挤颠簸的高速公路减缓了货物的流动，以及传统上优先考虑乘客运输的火车系统。

Rail authorities are nearing completion of a dedicated rail corridor to move freight between Mumbai and New Delhi. That will allow the double-stacking of containers, while permitting trains to double their speed, effectively quadrupling the system’s capacity.
铁路部门即将完成孟买和新德里之间的货运专用铁路走廊。这将允许集装箱双层堆叠，同时使列车的速度提高一倍，从而将系统的实际容量提高三倍。

When it opened in 1984, the Costco on West Dimond Boulevard in Anchorage did not seem like the future of food. A glorified shed the color of stale coffee, the warehouse offered the sort of products and deals Alaskans go crazy for: mammoth quantities of staples like peanut butter and tomato sauce, along with local favorites such as caribou sausage. The state’s extreme environment and the need to travel hours or even days for groceries made it a hit right off the bat.
1984年开业时，安克雷奇市西戴蒙德大道上的Costco似乎并不代表食品的未来。这座仓库本质上就是个棚屋，颜色像不新鲜的咖啡，它提供的是阿拉斯加人为之疯狂的那种产品和折扣：大份量的日常食物，比如花生酱和番茄酱，以及驯鹿香肠等当地人的最爱。阿拉斯加的环境极为恶劣，人们需要花费数小时甚至数天的时间出行购买食品杂货，这使得Costco一经推出就大受欢迎

In the midst of that bleak Midwestern winter, Ms. Harris was there to knock on doors for Barack Obama, the junior senator from Illinois mounting a long-shot bid for the presidency.
在阴冷的中西部冬日里，贺锦丽要去挨家挨户上门给贝拉克·奥巴马拉票，后者当时是伊利诺伊州的一位资浅参议员，正在进行一场希望渺茫的总统竞选

In 1958, a young graduate student moved to the United States from her native India because she wanted to find a cure for breast cancer. She fell in love, got married and had two daughters. She named her eldest Kamala, a Sanskrit name meaning lotus flower.
1958年，一名年轻的研究生从她的祖国印度搬到美国，因为她想找到治疗乳腺癌的方法。她坠入了爱河，结婚并生下两个女儿。她给长女取名卡玛拉，梵语“莲花”的意思

Politicians — and recent Democratic presidential nominees, especially — have leaned on their life stories, their parents and their childhoods as a way to explain themselves and their values to the American public, often holding out a humble background or a difficult childhood as a way to connect with millions of others who did not have the elusive white-picket-fence American upbringing.
政界人士——尤其是近些年的民主党总统候选人——把他们的生活故事、父母和童年作为向美国公众解释自己及其价值观的一种方式，通常是通过卑微的背景或艰难的童年，从而与那些并非在白篱笆式美国中产阶级环境下长大的人们建立联系

As he kicked off the exhibition this month, John Lee, the Beijing-backed leader of Hong Kong, made clear that its overarching purpose was to be a warning to the city. “Safeguarding national security is always a continuous effort.
北京支持的香港领导人李家超在本月为展览揭幕时明确表示，展览的首要目的是为香港敲响警钟。“维护国家安全只有进行时，没有完成时，”他说

Both sides said they had agreed to a video call between their top military commanders in the region. The United States said that such a call would be held in the “near future,” but China was more noncommittal, saying that it would take place “at an appropriate time.” This theater-command-level dialogue is essential for crisis prevention
双方都表示同意双方的战区领导举行视频通话。美国表示，这样的电话会议将在“不久的将来”举行，但中国的态度更为含糊，称将“适时”举行。这种战区司令级别的对话对于预防危机至关重要

According to a ministry official, a Chinese reconnaissance aircraft briefly entered Japanese territory near Nagasaki Prefecture around 11:30 a.m. on Monday. In response, Japan’s Self-Defense Force put fighter jets on high alert and issued a warning to the Chinese aircraft.
据防卫省官员说，一架中国侦察机周一上午11点30分左右短暂进入长崎县附近的日本领空。作为回应，日本自卫队战斗机处于高度戒备状态，并向中国飞机发出了警告

China also temporarily blocked imports of canola, an oil seed, from Canada. While the step was ostensibly taken because of insects in the grain, Canada viewed it as further retaliation.
当时中国还暂时禁止从加拿大进口油菜籽。虽然这一措施表面上是由于作物中的昆虫，但加拿大认为这是进一步的报复之举。

Hong Kong teenagers find it all pretty amusing. A few said on social media that the officials behind the policy have their “heads in the clouds.” Others have worked it into sexual slang, talking about “friends with badminton” instead of “friends with benefits.”
香港青少年觉得这一切都很有趣。一些人在社交媒体上表示，该政策背后的官员“头脑不清”。还有人把它变成了性俚语，用“羽毛球友”来代替“炮友”。

Nepal’s economy, heavily reliant on overseas remittances and tourism, has struggled to recover since the pandemic. The international airport in Pokhara, a picturesque city in the foothills of the Himalayas, was seen as a way to bolster tourism and breathe new life into the economy.
尼泊尔经济严重依赖海外汇款和旅游业，新冠疫情后一直难以复苏。位于喜马拉雅山麓风景如画的城市博卡拉的国际机场曾被视为有助于促进旅游业，为经济注入新活力

More than a decade ago, when Russia pushed Pavel Durov to shut down the pages of opposition politicians on a Facebook-like site he had created, the tech entrepreneur responded online by posting a cheeky picture of a hoodie-wearing dog with its tongue out.Thirteen years later, Mr. Durov’s anti-establishment streak appears to have gotten him into a fresh round of trouble with the authorities.
十多年前，当俄罗斯敦促帕维尔·杜罗夫在他创建的类似Facebook的网站上关闭反对派政治人士的页面时，这位科技企业家在网上发布了一张放肆的照片，上面是一只穿着连帽衫、吐着舌头的狗。13年后，杜罗夫的反体制倾向似乎又给他带来了与当局的新一轮麻烦。

Mr. Durov’s arrest has caused a firestorm, turning him into a folk hero among those concerned about free speech and government censorship, especially as scrutiny of online content has increased globally. 
杜罗夫的被捕引发了轩然大波，在关注言论自由和政府审查的人当中，他成了民间英雄，尤其是考虑到全球范围内对网络内容的审查正变得越来越严格。

Born in 1984 in the Soviet Union, Mr. Durov moved with his family when he was 4 to northern Italy. His brother, Nikolai, a math whiz who became Telegram’s chief technology officer, was featured on Italian television solving cubic equations. In the early 1990s, after the Soviet Union collapsed, the Durovs returned to St. Petersburg, where Pavel and Nikolai participated in youth math competitions and coded on an IBM computer the family had brought back from Italy.
杜罗夫1984年出生于苏联，四岁时随家人移居意大利北部。他的哥哥尼古拉是数学天才，曾在意大利电视上表演解三次方程，后来成为Telegram的首席技术官。上世纪90年代初苏联解体后，杜罗夫一家回到圣彼得堡，帕维尔和尼古拉在那里参加青少年数学竞赛，并用他们从意大利带回来的一台IBM电脑编程。

Mr. Durov has citizenship for the United Arab Emirates and France, according to Telegram. Though he travels by private jet, he has said he eschews buying things, keeping hundreds of millions of dollars in his bank account and Bitcoin to ensure he can be free. Bloomberg has estimated his net worth at more than $9 billion.
Telegram称，杜罗夫拥有阿联酋和法国国籍。虽然他乘坐私人飞机旅行，但他说自己总是避免购物，用存在银行里的数亿美元和比特币来确保自己可以自由自在。彭博社估计他的净资产超过90亿美元

For years, internet company executives rarely faced personal liability in Western democracies for what took place on their platforms. But as law enforcement agencies, regulators and policymakers ramp up scrutiny of online platforms and exchanges, they are increasingly considering when to hold company leaders directly responsible.
多年来，在西方民主国家，互联网公司的高管很少因平台上发生的事情而承担个人责任。但随着执法机构、监管部门和政策制定者加强对在线平台和平台上交流的审查，他们正在越来越多地考虑是否让公司领导人承担直接责任的问题。

That shift was punctuated by Mr. Durov’s arrest over the weekend, raising questions over whether tech executives like Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg also risk being arrested when they next set foot on European soil.
杜罗夫上周末的被捕表明了这个转变已经发生，同时也提出了像Meta的扎克伯格等科技公司高管下次踏上欧洲土地时是否也会面临被捕风险的问题。

Historically, companies have been held responsible for a platform’s transgressions, rather than individuals. And legally, the bar is high in the United States and Europe to prosecute individuals for activities at their companies, especially with U.S. laws like Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet platforms from being responsible for harmful speech.
从历史上看，平台违规行为的责任者是公司，而不是个人。从法律上看，美国和欧洲国家因公司活动对拥有公司的个人提起诉讼的门槛很高，尤其是在美国，因为美国有保护互联网平台免于对平台上的有害言论负法律责任的《通信规范法》第230条等法律。

While French authorities have provided few specifics, he faces a raft of potential charges related to activities on Telegram, including child sexual abuse material, drug trafficking, fraud, money laundering, abetting criminal transactions and refusing to cooperate with law enforcement.
虽然法国当局没有提供具体细节，但他面临一系列与Telegram平台上的活动有关的潜在指控，包括儿童遭受性虐待的内容、贩毒、欺诈、洗钱、怂恿犯罪交易，以及拒绝与执法部门合作等。

If I was a betting person, I would say that there will be a day that Elon Musk is on trial or be in prison in some country because of his refusal and his thumbing the nose at the rule of law
如果我是个爱打赌的人，我会说，有朝一日，埃隆·马斯克会因为拒绝监管、蔑视法律而在某个国家受审或入狱

China will hold live-fire military drills near its border with Myanmar starting on Tuesday, fortifying its boundaries with a southern neighbor that has been engulfed in a civil war for more than three years.
中国将于周二开始在靠近缅甸的边境地区举行实弹军事演习，以加强与这个南部邻国的边界安全。缅甸陷入内战已逾三年。

China’s People’s Liberation Army’s Southern Theater Command said on Monday that it would conduct both land and air exercises in the southwestern province of Yunnan to test the “joint strike capabilities of theater troops and maintain security and stability in the border areas.” China conducted two similar drills in April.
中国人民解放军南部战区周一宣布，将在西南省份云南开展空地联合演习，以“检验战区部队联合打击能力，维护边境地区安全稳定”。中国在今年4月进行了两次类似演习

The string of economic shocks produced by the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine helped to supercharge the debt crisis. Food and energy prices soared as government coffers dwindled. The moves by central banks in wealthy countries to fight inflation with higher interest rates caused borrowing costs to rapidly climb.
新冠病毒大流行和俄罗斯入侵乌克兰造成的一系列经济冲击加剧了债务危机。食品和能源价格飙升，而政府金库里的钱却在减少。富裕国家的央行通过提高利率对抗通胀的举措导致借贷成本迅速攀升

“But,” he added with a sigh, “I can’t find true love.” Others share his frustrations, but downplay any yearning to find love. More than a few say they have lost hope.
但他叹了口气补充道，“我找不到真正的爱情。”其他人也有与他一样的沮丧，但对爱情的渴望则轻描淡写。不少人说他们已经不抱希望了

The gatherings are social events — people bring karaoke machines and speakers to the park to dance and sing. They bring thermoses to Ikea to fill with free coffee, and sit around birch and plastic white tables swapping stories about their childhoods.
这些聚会是社交活动。人们带着卡拉OK机和扬声器来公园唱歌跳舞。他们带着保温杯来到宜家餐厅，装满免费的咖啡，坐在桦木和白色塑料桌子旁，聊起各自的童年往事

For a few hours in the afternoon, the Swedish furniture retailer has the feel of a social club. The second floor of the store has some of the usual weekday traffic — shoppers who amble through the cafeteria’s metal stanchions picking out the famous meatballs, almond cakes and lingonberry juice. But many more have come for something other than Swedish fare, some bringing their own food and loitering from table to table, pulling chairs up to where friends and acquaintances are seated.
在下午的几个小时里，这家瑞典家具零售商给人一种社交俱乐部的感觉。商店二楼有一部分是平日里的那种客流——购物者在自助餐厅的金属架间穿行，挑选著名的肉丸、杏仁蛋糕和越橘汁。但更多的人来到这里不是为了瑞典美食，有些人自带食物，从一张桌子走到另一张桌子，把椅子拉到朋友和熟人坐的地方

There’s no doubt that these people belong to the privileged class. To meet with them, I visited quite a few fancy mansions. One home sat atop the Los Gatos hills; my Uber driver whistled in awe when he turned onto the long driveway. Then he chuckled when he stopped his modest S.U.V. in front of a red Ferrari, a Tesla Cybertruck and a few Audis and BMWs. And there was Mr. Wei’s party, which one partygoer described to me as Gatsbyesque.That might be better than nothing.
毫无疑问，这些人属于特权阶层。为了与他们见面，我参观了不少豪宅。一所房子坐落在洛斯加托斯的山顶上；我的优步司机在驶入长长的私人车道时吹了一声口哨表示惊叹。然后，在把自己那辆不起眼的SUV停在一辆红色法拉利、一辆特斯拉Cybertruck以及几辆奥迪和宝马前面时，他轻声笑了起来。还有卫哲的派对，一位参加派对的人对我说，那是盖茨比式的. 总归是聊胜于无

He has since equivocated on TikTok, saying that, if elected, he would “save TikTok.” And despite his anti-China views, as president Mr. Trump welcomed U.S. investment by Taiwan’s Foxconn, which derives much of its revenue from its Chinese factories.
此后，他对TikTok的态度变得模棱两可，称如果当选的话，他将“拯救TikTok”。尽管持反华观点，特朗普在担任总统期间还是欢迎台湾的富士康到美国投资，富士康的大部分收入都来自它在中国的工厂。

At the 2018 groundbreaking for Foxconn’s $10 billion plant in Wisconsin to make flat-screen televisions, Mr. Trump called the project the “eighth wonder of the world.” Plans for the factory later sputtered amid changing market dynamics and much of the planned site remains undeveloped.
在2018年，在为富士康在威斯康星州投资100亿美元建设液晶面板厂举行的奠基仪式上，特朗普称该项目为“世界第八大奇迹”。然而，由于市场形势的变化，建厂计划后来搁浅，大部分规划用地依旧处于未开发状态

Speaking last month in Grand Rapids, former President Trump supported the onshoring of electrification manufacturing in our state and the United States by Chinese-affiliated companies，Trump wants the people of Michigan and our local economy to thrive from these types of jobs, and so do we.
前总统特朗普上个月在大急流城发表讲话时，支持中资企业将电气化制造业回流到本州和美国，特朗普希望密歇根人民和我们当地的经济能够从这些类型的工作中获利，我们也希望如此

Capping, rather than banning, Chinese imports could preserve access to Chinese innovation while making sure that protected domestic companies don’t get lazy, he said.
他说，限制而非禁止从中国进口产品，既能保留获取中国创新的机会，同时也能确保受保护的国内企业不会变得懒惰。

A potential objection to Friedberg’s trade defense coalition is that it’s overkill — that it would needlessly antagonize China, heightening the risk that a trade war would spill into a shooting war, or at least depriving the world of the benefits of cross-border trade and investment. Another objection is that it simply wouldn’t work: Coalition members would squabble and defect. Countries outside China and its sphere of influence would not have the energy, patience or skill to rebuild production capacity in long-lost industries that have strategic value.
对弗里德伯格的贸易防御联盟的一个潜在反对意见是，它有点矫枉过正——它会不必要地激怒中国，增加贸易战蔓延成真刀真枪的战争的风险，或者至少剥夺了世界从跨境贸易和投资中获益的机会。另一个反对意见是，它根本行不通：联盟成员会争吵和叛逃。中国及其势力范围以外的国家将没有精力、耐心或技能来重建早已失去的那些战略性行业产能

Finally, we need to talk about our common Western values. Isn’t the one major difference between us and authoritarian or dictatorial regimes our commitment to human rights, to the rule of law, to decency in this age of impunity, as David Miliband, the former British foreign secretary, once called the current global disorder? We can and we should be proud of this commitment. The problem is that the Western world — and in particular the United States — is being accused of applying double standards in dealing with wars, conflicts, and human rights abuses.
最后，我们需要谈谈共同的西方价值观。英国前外交大臣戴维·米利班德曾将当前的全球混乱称为有罪不罚的时代，我们与专制或独裁政权之间的一个主要区别，不就是我们对人权、法治和礼度的承诺吗？我们能够而且应该为这一承诺感到自豪。问题是，西方世界——尤其是美国——被指责在处理战争、冲突和侵犯人权问题上采用双重标准
