It is possible, however, that the actual attack was not filmed, as drooping tree branches appear to block any view of the site from nearby surveillance cameras.
但一个可能性是，并未拍到实际的袭击过程，因为现场附近的监控摄像头被下垂的树枝阻挡住了。

It’s a veritable Hollywood movie. Women are scripting what will happen to Trump, who has treated women with such cruelty and contempt.And Trump will have to build an annex, maybe to his frontal or occipital lobe, to accommodate the sorority.
这是一部名副其实的好莱坞电影。女人们正在构思特朗普的下场，他曾如此残忍和轻蔑地对待女性。特朗普得盖一座附属建筑，才能装得下这个姐妹会，可能是在他的额叶或是枕叶里。

Who do you suppose was tasked with taking on that male vanity? Women! Jill Biden was exhorted to make everything right. Or it was Valerie Biden’s job. Or Pelosi’s. Hunter Biden was reportedly hunkered down with Dad, but did anyone demand that he tame the paterfamilias? Not that I heard or read. Women were given the heaping measure of responsibility, though they often get only a soupçon of credit.
你觉得是谁承担了应对男人虚荣心的任务？女人！人们劝吉尔·拜登来解决这个难题。或者，这项工作要由瓦莱丽·拜登来做。要由佩洛西来做。据报道，亨特·拜登一直和父亲在一起，但是有人要求他说服“老爷子”吗？我没有听说过，也没有读到过。女人承担了大量的责任，尽管她们往往分不到什么功劳。

These tests would include blood cell counts, basic bodily chemistries (such as sodium and potassium levels) and electrocardiograms. These results are helpful because they can suggest major diseases that have not yet been identified.
这类检验包括血细胞计数、基础生化（例如钠和钾的水平）和心电图指标。这些检验的结果可以揭示一些尚未发现的重大疾病，因此是有帮助的。

There are talented politicians, there are untalented politicians, and then there’s JD Vance — I mean, he tried to calm the furor over his “childless cat ladies” remarks by feebly deadpanning that he’s “got nothing against cats.”
这世上的政治人物，有的才华横溢，有的平庸无能，还有第三种，叫JD·万斯——怎么说呢，当初“不养孩子只养猫的女人”的言论引发众怒，他为了打圆场，弱弱地说了个冷笑话，说他“对猫没意见”。

Mr. Hu’s post soon disappeared from Weibo, but not before it set off a kerfuffle.Market-oriented reform is simply less of a priority for the leadership now compared to 2013 against the rising importance of self-reliance, national security and state control
胡锡进的帖子很快就从微博上消失了，但引发了一场轩然大波。与2013年相比，在自力更生、国家安全和国家控制的重要性日益上升的背景下，以市场为导向的改革对领导层来说并不是优先事项。

The wild swings in markets recently are a case study in how seemingly distinct pillars around the globe are connected through the financial system — and the domino effect that can follow if one of them falls.
最近市场的剧烈波动可谓一个活生生的例子，说明了全球各地看起来截然不同的支柱是如何通过金融体系联系在一起的，以及如果其中一个支柱倒下，可能随之而来的多米诺骨牌效应。

Factors like a slow buildup of risky bets, the sudden undoing of a popular way to fund such trades and diverging decisions by global policymakers are each playing a role. Some of these forces can be traced back years, while others emerged only recently.
高风险押注的缓慢积累、为此类交易融资的一种常用方式的突然崩塌，以及全球政策制定者的决策分歧等因素都起到了作用。其中一些因素可以追溯到几年前，还有一些则是最近才出现的。

While it was under construction, the company sent American engineers to Tainan for training and to shadow their Taiwanese counterparts, observing TSMC’s all-hands-on-deck way of working up close.
在建设期间，该公司派美国工程师到台南接受培训，让他们跟随台湾同行近距离观察台积电全员齐心协力的工作方式。

The hiccups getting the livestream going renewed questions about X’s ability to handle high-profile events. Without providing evidence, Mr. Musk blamed the snafu on a “massive” distributed denial of service attack, a type of cyberattack that uses floods of malicious web traffic to overwhelm sites and knock them offline.
直播过程中出现的小问题再次令人们质疑X处理受到高度关注活动的能力。马斯克在没有提供证据的情况下将这次混乱归咎于“大规模的”分布式拒绝服务攻击，这是一种利用大量恶意网络流量令网站过载并使其下线的网络攻击。

The slice of the Himalayas where many Chinese villages have sprung up has been largely uninhabited for good reason. Its rocky, icy terrain is particularly forbidding in winter, with roads buried many months of the year by deep snow. The air is thin and cold. The land is barren, making farming difficult.
喜马拉雅山脉的这片地区涌现出了许多中国村庄，但此前这里大部分地区无人居住，这是有原因的。这里多岩石和冰雪覆盖的地形在冬季尤其险峻，一年中有好几个月道路都被厚厚的积雪覆盖。空气稀薄而寒冷。土地贫瘠，难以耕种。

Lilibet speaks good English. Her coach is British and amply tattooed. She competed on Tuesday in park skateboarding, an insurgent sport in which the point among the sisterhood of athletes is not just winning a medal but embodying a mantra of female empowerment.
莉莉白能说一口流利的英语。她的教练是一个身上有很多文身的英国人。周二，她参加了公园滑板项目的比赛，这是一项新兴的运动，运动员之间姐妹情谊的意义不仅在于赢得奖牌，还体现了女性赋权的口号。

For now though, life is mostly peaceful and slow on the island. Small wooden fishing boats line a white sand beach on the eastern shore. Rough houses pieced together from plywood, scrap lumber and tarps are the main form of shelter. On a recent evening, a few people gathered near the beach to debone fish, while others waded into tide pools with fishing spears.
不过，目前岛上的生活基本是平静而又缓慢的。小型木制渔船沿着东岸的白色沙滩停靠。用胶合板、废木料和防水布拼凑起来的简陋房屋是主要的居所。不久前的一个晚上，几个人聚集在海滩附近剔鱼骨，还有人拿着鱼叉涉入潮池

They have disrupted oil-and-gas prospecting, destroyed coral reefs to build artificial islands and chased Southeast Asian civilian fleets from traditional fishing grounds.
他们中断了油气勘探，为建造人工岛破坏了珊瑚礁，还把在传统渔场打渔的东南亚国家民用船队驱赶出去

The school is in one of Foshan’s oldest neighborhoods, where thick banyan trees dangle aerial roots over sidewalks and streets.Mr. Walz soon settled into the cocoon of daily life on a small-town campus
佛山一中位于该市一个历史最悠久的社区，繁茂的榕树垂下气生根，将那里的人行道和街头覆盖。沃尔兹很快适应了小镇校园的日常生活

The students, most of whom had never traveled abroad, barely spent any time in the classroom. In addition to sightseeing, they met with tai chi masters, practiced their chopstick skills at family-style meals and tried Chinese calligraphy.
这些学生中的大多数从未出过国，在中国的时候，他们把时间几乎都花在了课堂之外。除了观光，他们还去见了太极拳师傅，在中国家宴式的场合练习用筷子，还尝试写毛笔字。

That Olympic spirit is supposed to float somehow in a bubble above the cut-and-thrust of global politics.We should not make the mistake to raise ourselves to referees of political disputes because we will be crushed by these political powers.
奥林匹克精神本应像一个气泡，以某种方式漂浮在全球政治的刀光剑影之上。我们不应该错误地把自己当作政治争端的裁判，因为我们会被这些政治力量压垮

It’s a fallacy, of course, that politics and sports exist in separate spheres, and even the I.O.C. admits it. How could they not be conjoined when the Games depend on nationhood as an organizing principle of competition? Patriotism is only a punch or a paddle away from jingoism.
当然，认为政治和体育存在于不同的领域，这是一种谬论，甚至国际奥委会也承认这一点。既然运动会以国家身份作为竞赛的组织原则，它们怎么可能不被结合在一起呢？爱国主义与好战主义只差一拳或是一桨。

A gold medalist diver’s mother said she was afraid for her daughter to come home after their hometown was swarmed with her supporters. A champion swimmer whose hotel was staked out by admirers disbanded his official fan group and told an interviewer he would rather have performed worse if it meant he would be left alone.
一名获得金牌的跳水运动员的母亲说，她不敢让女儿回家，因为老家挤满了女儿的粉丝。一名游泳冠军住的酒店被崇拜者长时间包围后，他解散了自己的官方粉丝团，并在接受采访时说，如果能清净一点，宁愿这次成绩没有那么优秀。

Over the past decade, during which China doled out more lending than the Paris Club — a grouping of 22 of the world’s largest creditor nations — the total value of interest payments of the 75 poorest countries in the world have quadrupled and will outstrip their total annual spending on health, education and infrastructure combined, according to the World Bank.
据世界银行的数据，中国在过去十年发放的贷款超过了由22个世界上最大的债权国组成的巴黎俱乐部发放的贷款总额，而世界上75个最贫穷国家为中国贷款支付的利息总额在这十年中已增长至以前的四倍，并将超过这些国家在医疗、教育和基础设施方面的年度总支出。

Ms. Su began vlogging after she set out from her home in Zhengzhou, a city in central China, in September 2020. In between shots of turquoise lakes and rolling fields, she explained why she, a retired factory worker with a high school education, had finally struck out on her own. She was tired of living for others, bearing her husband’s demands and shouldering housework. For decades, she had believed that was just how life was for women, but now she was finally ready for a change.
2020年9月，苏敏从郑州的家中出发后，开始用视频博客记录旅程。视频中除了碧绿的湖泊和连绵起伏的田野外，还有她对自己为什么自驾游的解释。这名有高中文化程度的退休工人终于决定要自己独立出去。她厌倦了为他人活着，忍受丈夫的要求，承担家务劳动。几十年来，她曾一直认为那就是女性的生活，但现在她终于决定要摆脱那种生活。

India is now pursuing an aggressive campaign to catch up, readying plans for new ports while expanding existing docks. Whether those designs come to fruition and how quickly could shape the results of one of India’s grandest aspirations: swelling into a full-fledged manufacturing and export colossus.Dredging has to be done at Indian ports,China definitely has an edge over India.
印度目前正在采取措施积极赶上，在准备建设新港的同时扩建现有的码头。这些计划能否实现、实现的速度如何，将影响到印度最宏伟的抱负之一：将国家发展为一个成熟的制造业和出口巨头。印度港口必须进行疏浚，中国肯定比印度有优势

Like port overseers on every shore, Mr. Wagh, who runs the port authority in Navi Mumbai, is frustrated by the parts of his business that he does not control: congested and bumpy highways that slow the movement of cargo, for instance, and a train system that has traditionally prioritized the moving of passengers.
和各地的港口监管者一样，管理新孟买港务局的瓦格对那些自己无能为力的事感到沮丧：比如，拥挤颠簸的高速公路减缓了货物的流动，以及传统上优先考虑乘客运输的火车系统。

Rail authorities are nearing completion of a dedicated rail corridor to move freight between Mumbai and New Delhi. That will allow the double-stacking of containers, while permitting trains to double their speed, effectively quadrupling the system’s capacity.
铁路部门即将完成孟买和新德里之间的货运专用铁路走廊。这将允许集装箱双层堆叠，同时使列车的速度提高一倍，从而将系统的实际容量提高三倍。

When it opened in 1984, the Costco on West Dimond Boulevard in Anchorage did not seem like the future of food. A glorified shed the color of stale coffee, the warehouse offered the sort of products and deals Alaskans go crazy for: mammoth quantities of staples like peanut butter and tomato sauce, along with local favorites such as caribou sausage. The state’s extreme environment and the need to travel hours or even days for groceries made it a hit right off the bat.
1984年开业时，安克雷奇市西戴蒙德大道上的Costco似乎并不代表食品的未来。这座仓库本质上就是个棚屋，颜色像不新鲜的咖啡，它提供的是阿拉斯加人为之疯狂的那种产品和折扣：大份量的日常食物，比如花生酱和番茄酱，以及驯鹿香肠等当地人的最爱。阿拉斯加的环境极为恶劣，人们需要花费数小时甚至数天的时间出行购买食品杂货，这使得Costco一经推出就大受欢迎

In the midst of that bleak Midwestern winter, Ms. Harris was there to knock on doors for Barack Obama, the junior senator from Illinois mounting a long-shot bid for the presidency.

1958年，一名年轻的研究生从她的祖国印度搬到美国，因为她想找到治疗乳腺癌的方法。她坠入了爱河，结婚并生下两个女儿。她给长女取名卡玛拉，梵语“莲花”的意思

Politicians — and recent Democratic presidential nominees, especially — have leaned on their life stories, their parents and their childhoods as a way to explain themselves and their values to the American public, often holding out a humble background or a difficult childhood as a way to connect with millions of others who did not have the elusive white-picket-fence American upbringing.
政界人士——尤其是近些年的民主党总统候选人——把他们的生活故事、父母和童年作为向美国公众解释自己及其价值观的一种方式，通常是通过卑微的背景或艰难的童年，从而与那些并非在白篱笆式美国中产阶级环境下长大的人们建立联系
