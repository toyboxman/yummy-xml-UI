Through its powerful link to economic growth, international trade has long been a scourge of global poverty. Developing countries that liberalized their trade regimes and integrated with the world economy — call them globalizers — have vastly outperformed the nonglobalizers over the past four decades. The globalizers have also grown much faster than rich countries, allowing them to gradually reduce the still yawning per capita income gap with the West.
国际贸易与经济增长紧密相连，长期以来一直是全球贫困的天敌。过去40年里，使其贸易制度自由化并融入世界经济的发展中国家——我们称其为全球化国家——表现大大超过了非全球化国家。全球化国家的发展速度也比富裕国家快得多，这使它们能够逐渐缩小与西方国家之间仍在扩大的人均收入差距

Higher tariffs designed to protect jobs in affluent countries have been amply documented as simultaneously regressive and futile. They are regressive because low-income households disproportionately consume goods that are traded, such as televisions and groceries, which tariffs make more expensive, while more affluent consumers tend to purchase a higher share of nontradable services, such as therapy and restaurant meals. They are futile because the jobs they save, if any, are generally outnumbered by the job losses they cause in other sectors of the economy.
旨在保护富裕国家就业的高关税已被大量实际证据证明是倒退和徒劳的。它们的效果是递减的，因为低收入家庭消费大量电视和杂货等贸易商品，关税会使其变得更贵；而更富裕的消费者往往会更多购买医疗和餐馆餐饮等非贸易服务。而说关税徒劳无益是因为，即使能挽救工作岗位，通常也会被关税造成的其他经济部门的就业岗位损失所抵消

This would diminish the material prospects of the world’s poorest people and slow the rate at which generations of children can expect to escape the kind of life-stunting deprivation that is no more than a fading memory in the West. If international trade were to shrivel under the assault of populist passions and muddled analysis, that would be unfortunate indeed for rich countries. For the vastly more populous remainder of the world, it would be a tragedy.
这将削弱世界上最贫困人口的物质前景，并减缓一代又一代儿童摆脱匮乏生活的速度，而在西方，这样的贫困已经成为一种逐渐消失的记忆。如果国际贸易在民粹主义激情和混乱分析的冲击下萎缩，这对富裕国家来说确实是一种不幸。但对于世界上人口多得多的其他国家来说，将会是一场悲剧。

First, he warned against hubris: “We’ve seen more than one election slip away from us when we thought it couldn’t happen, when people got distracted by phony issues or overconfident.” That’s something that any Clinton understands in his — or her — gut.
首先，他告诫不要傲慢：“我们不止一次见过，在我们认为十拿九稳的时候，我们被虚假问题分散注意力或过度自信，丢掉了选举。”两位克林顿对此都有切肤感受

“I urge you to meet people where they are,” said Clinton, who knows something about winning votes outside of solid blue states. “I urge you not to demean them, but not to pretend you don’t disagree with them if you do. Treat them with respect — just the way you’d like them to treat you.”
“我敦促你们从他们的角度去了解他们，”对争取非蓝州选民有些心得的克林顿说。“我敦促你们不要贬低他们，当你们和他们有分歧时，不要装作不存在分歧。尊重他们，你希望他们怎么对待你，你就怎么对待他们。”

• Pretty much anything: Pens can contain hidden cameras. Lighters can be bugged with listening devices. That dragonfly? Actually a tiny aerial drone. And beware the tissue box, which a guest may bring to a dinner party where major infrastructure projects are being discussed. A recorder may be hidden inside. “Some unassuming daily objects may contain mysteries,” the post said, above a hotline for reporting spies.
• 几乎所有的东西：钢笔里可能藏着摄像头。打火机里可能装着窃听器。那只蜻蜓？其实是一个微型无人机。还要当心纸巾盒，客人可能会把一个纸巾盒带到讨论主要基础设施项目的饭桌上来。纸巾盒里也许藏着录音机。“一些不起眼的日常用品里也可能暗藏玄机，”该帖写道，并提供了举报这些东西的热线。

Farmers in the city of Shijiazhuang, 180 miles from Beijing, showed in a video posted to social media in late August how days of downpours and an overflowing reservoir had turned soil into sludge unfit for growing plants. Across the country, a shift in weather patterns has caught people off guard, with floods arriving two months earlier than usual in the south and then extending to northern and eastern provinces that are more accustomed to summer drought
在距北京290公里的石家庄，农民在8月下旬把一段视频发到了社交媒体上，视频中可以看到，连日暴雨加上水库溢水，将土地变成不适宜种植的烂泥田。全国各地天气模式的变化让人措手不及，洪水比往常早了两个月来到南方，然后蔓延到夏季往往干旱的北方和东部省份

The distribution of water is historically uneven in the country, leaving the south prone to floods and the north vulnerable to drought in the heat of summer. The government invested heavily in nearly 8,000 water conservancy projects across the country, including diverting excess water from large rivers in the south to the northern part of the country.
中国历来就有水资源分布不均的问题。在夏季的高温期，南方易遭受洪水，北方易遭受旱灾。政府已对全国近8000个水利项目投入巨额资金，其中包括把南方大河多余的水引到北方的“南水北调”工程

Flood control in cities has sometimes come at the expense of rural residents. Last summer, nearly a million residents of the northern province of Hebei and villages neighboring Beijing had to evacuate after their towns were flooded when officials opened the floodgates to low-lying land surrounding the capital.
城市的防洪有时要牺牲农村居民的利益。去年夏天，官员们为了保护首都，打开闸门向首都附近的低洼地带泄洪，导致河北省北部和北京周边的村庄被淹，村里近百万居民被迫撤离

Officials will face more strategic choices about where floodwater is discharged as floods become more frequent in coming years, experts said.Teams of experts were dispatched to drain fields and teach farmers how to clean leaves of sludge. Farmers whose harvests have been ruined were given emergency relief seeds of hardier crops.
专家们说，随着洪水在未来几年变得更加频繁，官员们将在向哪里排洪的问题上面临更多的战略选择。政府已派专家组去指导田间排水工作，教农民如何清除叶子上的污泥。收成已被毁掉的农民得到了耐寒作物的紧急救援种子。

In 2004, as China’s economy was emerging as a global force, a group of researchers started conducting nationwide surveys asking Chinese people if they were better off financially than they were five years earlier.The post-Covid rebound that was supposed to bring the economy roaring back to life was more like a whimper.
2004年，随着中国经济逐渐成为一股全球力量，一组研究人员开始在全国范围内进行调查，询问中国人的财务状况是否比五年前更好。新冠疫情后的反弹本应使经济恢复生机，但看起来更像是雷声大雨点小。

By contrast, Hamas has a low threshold: It seeks to survive the war intact, a modest goal that allows it to weather a level of devastation that might have caused other groups to surrender.
相比之下，哈马斯的目标很低：挺过这场战争，如此简单的目标使其能够经受住惨重的损失，而放在别的组织，这样的损失可能已经促使它们投降。

Hamas’s extensive subterranean tunnel network also makes it hard for Israel to win. Some of the group’s leaders are thought to be deep beneath the ground, surrounded in some cases by Israeli hostages, making it challenging for Israel to find the leaders, let alone attack them without harming its own kidnapped citizens.
哈马斯庞大的地下隧道网络也使以色列难以取胜。据信，该组织的一些领导人藏身地下深处，某些情况下与以色列人质在一起，这使得以色列难以找到这些领导人，更不用说在不伤害本国遭绑架公民的情况下对他们发起袭击了。

Ever since, Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging rocket and missile fire across the Israel-Lebanon border, while trying to avoid an all-out ground war that would most likely devastate both countries. Israel’s fighter jets could cripple Beirut, the Lebanese capital, while Hezbollah has thousands of precision-guided missiles that could wreck Israeli cities.
自那以后，以色列和真主党一直在以黎边境交火，向对方发射火箭弹和导弹，同时试图避免一场极有可能摧毁两国的全面地面战争。以色列的战斗机可以摧毁黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特，而真主党拥有数千枚精确制导导弹，可以摧毁以色列的城市

“I don’t anticipate that we will collectively become less conspiratorial,” said Adam Enders, an associate professor of political science at the University of Louisville. “If anything, the closer we get to Election Day, the more it’ll increase.”
“我不指望大家都会减少阴谋论的倾向，”路易斯维尔大学政治学系副教授亚当·恩德斯说。“依我看，我们离大选日越近，阴谋论就会越多。”

Hunter Biden pleaded guilty on Thursday to nine federal tax charges in Los Angeles after telling his legal team that he refused to subject his family to another round of anguish and humiliation after a gut-wrenching gun trial in Delaware three months ago.
周四，亨特·拜登在洛杉矶对九项联邦税收指控认罪，此前他告诉他的法律团队，在三个月前特拉华州那场令人痛苦的涉枪案审判后，他不想让家人再遭受一轮痛苦和羞辱

“There was only one path left for me,” he added. “I will not subject my family to more pain, more invasions of privacy and needless embarrassment. For all I have put them through over the years, I can spare them this, and so I have decided to plead guilty.”
“我只有一条路可走，”他还说。“我不会让我的家人遭受更多的痛苦，更多的隐私侵犯和不必要的羞辱。尽管这些年来我让他们经历了这么多，但我可以不让他们承受这些，所以我决定认罪。”

As technology has made it easier than ever to spread information, attention became a scarce resource, and the ensuing battle for attention resulted in a deluge of toxic information. But the battle lines are now shifting from attention to intimacy. The new generative artificial intelligence is capable of not only producing texts, images and videos, but also conversing with us directly, pretending to be human.
随着技术使信息传播变得比以往任何时候都更容易，注意力成了一种稀缺资源，随之而来的注意力争夺战导致了有害信息泛滥。但战线正从注意力转向亲密。新的生成式人工智能不仅能生成文本、图像和视频，还能与我们直接交谈，假装人类

African flags have been flown over Tiananmen Square. Leaders of African nations have been greeted by dancers, honor guards and children waving flags. They have been escorted in extensive motorcades past banners celebrating “A Shared Future for China and Africa” and giant, elaborate flower arrangements.
天安门广场上飘扬着非洲国家的国旗。非洲国家的领导人受到了舞者、仪仗队和挥舞旗帜的儿童的欢迎。在浩浩荡荡的车队护送下，他们经过街道两侧悬挂的“中非共命运合作启新程”的道旗，以及精心布置的巨型花坛

President William Ruto of Kenya, for instance, hopes to get funding to finish a railway line from the Rift Valley to Malaba town on Kenya’s western border with Uganda. He is also looking for more investment to build roads and dams and set up an industrial park for pharmaceutical companies.
比如，肯尼亚总统鲁托希望获得资金，修建一条从非洲大裂谷到肯尼亚西部与乌干达接壤的城镇马拉巴的铁路。他还在寻求更多投资，以修建公路和大坝，并为制药企业建立一个工业园。

In the run-up to the summit, Chinese state media outlets have highlighted projects backed by Chinese lenders in African villages, like solar panel installations and soybean-planting techniques, as bringing direct benefits to communities.It has this aspect of making sure that the China-Africa relationship, at least on a global scale, doesn’t look predatory
在峰会召开前夕，中国的官方媒体在报道中强调中国的贷款机构在非洲农村所支持的项目，如太阳能电池板安装和大豆种植技术，称其为社区带来了直接的好处。这样做的目的是要确保中非关系，至少在全球范围内，不会看起来像是掠夺性的关系

Ms. Brautigam said that the summit follows months of behind-the-scenes diplomacy between Chinese and African officials. “You can contrast this with how we do things in the U.S., where engagement is far more ad hoc,” she said.
布劳蒂加姆表示，这次峰会是中非官员数月幕后外交的结果。“这与我们在美国的做法形成了鲜明对比，我们之间的接触更加零散，”她说。

China has also won support on the African continent for the position it has taken on Israel’s war in Gaza. Beijing has brought rival Palestinian factions together for talks as it has sought a bigger diplomatic role in the Middle East. It has asserted its longstanding support of Palestinian statehood and criticized Israel’s bombardment of the region.
中国对以色列在加沙的战争所采取的立场也赢得了非洲国家的支持。中国政府希望在中东地区发挥更大的外交作用，已将巴勒斯坦敌对派系召集到一起进行谈判。它坚持对巴勒斯坦建国的长期支持，并批评以色列对该地区的轰炸。

That position aligns China with countries like South Africa, which has called Israel’s policies toward Palestinians an “extreme form of apartheid.” “China’s full embrace of the Palestinian cause has fully aligned it with almost the entire global south,” said Mr. Olander. For many Africans, he added, the war “closely resembles the colonial wars that ravaged their countries.”
中国的这一立场与南非等国一致。南非称以色列对巴勒斯坦人的政策是“极端形式的种族隔离”。奥兰德表示，“中国对巴勒斯坦事业的全面支持，与几乎整个全球南方是完全一致的。”他还说，对许多非洲人来说，这场战争“与摧毁他们国家的殖民战争非常相似”。
