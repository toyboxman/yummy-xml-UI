Through its powerful link to economic growth, international trade has long been a scourge of global poverty. Developing countries that liberalized their trade regimes and integrated with the world economy — call them globalizers — have vastly outperformed the nonglobalizers over the past four decades. The globalizers have also grown much faster than rich countries, allowing them to gradually reduce the still yawning per capita income gap with the West.
国际贸易与经济增长紧密相连，长期以来一直是全球贫困的天敌。过去40年里，使其贸易制度自由化并融入世界经济的发展中国家——我们称其为全球化国家——表现大大超过了非全球化国家。全球化国家的发展速度也比富裕国家快得多，这使它们能够逐渐缩小与西方国家之间仍在扩大的人均收入差距

Higher tariffs designed to protect jobs in affluent countries have been amply documented as simultaneously regressive and futile. They are regressive because low-income households disproportionately consume goods that are traded, such as televisions and groceries, which tariffs make more expensive, while more affluent consumers tend to purchase a higher share of nontradable services, such as therapy and restaurant meals. They are futile because the jobs they save, if any, are generally outnumbered by the job losses they cause in other sectors of the economy.
旨在保护富裕国家就业的高关税已被大量实际证据证明是倒退和徒劳的。它们的效果是递减的，因为低收入家庭消费大量电视和杂货等贸易商品，关税会使其变得更贵；而更富裕的消费者往往会更多购买医疗和餐馆餐饮等非贸易服务。而说关税徒劳无益是因为，即使能挽救工作岗位，通常也会被关税造成的其他经济部门的就业岗位损失所抵消

This would diminish the material prospects of the world’s poorest people and slow the rate at which generations of children can expect to escape the kind of life-stunting deprivation that is no more than a fading memory in the West. If international trade were to shrivel under the assault of populist passions and muddled analysis, that would be unfortunate indeed for rich countries. For the vastly more populous remainder of the world, it would be a tragedy.
这将削弱世界上最贫困人口的物质前景，并减缓一代又一代儿童摆脱匮乏生活的速度，而在西方，这样的贫困已经成为一种逐渐消失的记忆。如果国际贸易在民粹主义激情和混乱分析的冲击下萎缩，这对富裕国家来说确实是一种不幸。但对于世界上人口多得多的其他国家来说，将会是一场悲剧。

First, he warned against hubris: “We’ve seen more than one election slip away from us when we thought it couldn’t happen, when people got distracted by phony issues or overconfident.” That’s something that any Clinton understands in his — or her — gut.
首先，他告诫不要傲慢：“我们不止一次见过，在我们认为十拿九稳的时候，我们被虚假问题分散注意力或过度自信，丢掉了选举。”两位克林顿对此都有切肤感受

“I urge you to meet people where they are,” said Clinton, who knows something about winning votes outside of solid blue states. “I urge you not to demean them, but not to pretend you don’t disagree with them if you do. Treat them with respect — just the way you’d like them to treat you.”
“我敦促你们从他们的角度去了解他们，”对争取非蓝州选民有些心得的克林顿说。“我敦促你们不要贬低他们，当你们和他们有分歧时，不要装作不存在分歧。尊重他们，你希望他们怎么对待你，你就怎么对待他们。”

• Pretty much anything: Pens can contain hidden cameras. Lighters can be bugged with listening devices. That dragonfly? Actually a tiny aerial drone. And beware the tissue box, which a guest may bring to a dinner party where major infrastructure projects are being discussed. A recorder may be hidden inside. “Some unassuming daily objects may contain mysteries,” the post said, above a hotline for reporting spies.
• 几乎所有的东西：钢笔里可能藏着摄像头。打火机里可能装着窃听器。那只蜻蜓？其实是一个微型无人机。还要当心纸巾盒，客人可能会把一个纸巾盒带到讨论主要基础设施项目的饭桌上来。纸巾盒里也许藏着录音机。“一些不起眼的日常用品里也可能暗藏玄机，”该帖写道，并提供了举报这些东西的热线。

Farmers in the city of Shijiazhuang, 180 miles from Beijing, showed in a video posted to social media in late August how days of downpours and an overflowing reservoir had turned soil into sludge unfit for growing plants. Across the country, a shift in weather patterns has caught people off guard, with floods arriving two months earlier than usual in the south and then extending to northern and eastern provinces that are more accustomed to summer drought
在距北京290公里的石家庄，农民在8月下旬把一段视频发到了社交媒体上，视频中可以看到，连日暴雨加上水库溢水，将土地变成不适宜种植的烂泥田。全国各地天气模式的变化让人措手不及，洪水比往常早了两个月来到南方，然后蔓延到夏季往往干旱的北方和东部省份

The distribution of water is historically uneven in the country, leaving the south prone to floods and the north vulnerable to drought in the heat of summer. The government invested heavily in nearly 8,000 water conservancy projects across the country, including diverting excess water from large rivers in the south to the northern part of the country.
中国历来就有水资源分布不均的问题。在夏季的高温期，南方易遭受洪水，北方易遭受旱灾。政府已对全国近8000个水利项目投入巨额资金，其中包括把南方大河多余的水引到北方的“南水北调”工程

Flood control in cities has sometimes come at the expense of rural residents. Last summer, nearly a million residents of the northern province of Hebei and villages neighboring Beijing had to evacuate after their towns were flooded when officials opened the floodgates to low-lying land surrounding the capital.
城市的防洪有时要牺牲农村居民的利益。去年夏天，官员们为了保护首都，打开闸门向首都附近的低洼地带泄洪，导致河北省北部和北京周边的村庄被淹，村里近百万居民被迫撤离

Officials will face more strategic choices about where floodwater is discharged as floods become more frequent in coming years, experts said.Teams of experts were dispatched to drain fields and teach farmers how to clean leaves of sludge. Farmers whose harvests have been ruined were given emergency relief seeds of hardier crops.
专家们说，随着洪水在未来几年变得更加频繁，官员们将在向哪里排洪的问题上面临更多的战略选择。政府已派专家组去指导田间排水工作，教农民如何清除叶子上的污泥。收成已被毁掉的农民得到了耐寒作物的紧急救援种子。

In 2004, as China’s economy was emerging as a global force, a group of researchers started conducting nationwide surveys asking Chinese people if they were better off financially than they were five years earlier.The post-Covid rebound that was supposed to bring the economy roaring back to life was more like a whimper.
2004年，随着中国经济逐渐成为一股全球力量，一组研究人员开始在全国范围内进行调查，询问中国人的财务状况是否比五年前更好。新冠疫情后的反弹本应使经济恢复生机，但看起来更像是雷声大雨点小。

By contrast, Hamas has a low threshold: It seeks to survive the war intact, a modest goal that allows it to weather a level of devastation that might have caused other groups to surrender.
相比之下，哈马斯的目标很低：挺过这场战争，如此简单的目标使其能够经受住惨重的损失，而放在别的组织，这样的损失可能已经促使它们投降。

Hamas’s extensive subterranean tunnel network also makes it hard for Israel to win. Some of the group’s leaders are thought to be deep beneath the ground, surrounded in some cases by Israeli hostages, making it challenging for Israel to find the leaders, let alone attack them without harming its own kidnapped citizens.
哈马斯庞大的地下隧道网络也使以色列难以取胜。据信，该组织的一些领导人藏身地下深处，某些情况下与以色列人质在一起，这使得以色列难以找到这些领导人，更不用说在不伤害本国遭绑架公民的情况下对他们发起袭击了。

Ever since, Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging rocket and missile fire across the Israel-Lebanon border, while trying to avoid an all-out ground war that would most likely devastate both countries. Israel’s fighter jets could cripple Beirut, the Lebanese capital, while Hezbollah has thousands of precision-guided missiles that could wreck Israeli cities.
自那以后，以色列和真主党一直在以黎边境交火，向对方发射火箭弹和导弹，同时试图避免一场极有可能摧毁两国的全面地面战争。以色列的战斗机可以摧毁黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特，而真主党拥有数千枚精确制导导弹，可以摧毁以色列的城市

“I don’t anticipate that we will collectively become less conspiratorial,” said Adam Enders, an associate professor of political science at the University of Louisville. “If anything, the closer we get to Election Day, the more it’ll increase.”
“我不指望大家都会减少阴谋论的倾向，”路易斯维尔大学政治学系副教授亚当·恩德斯说。“依我看，我们离大选日越近，阴谋论就会越多。”

Hunter Biden pleaded guilty on Thursday to nine federal tax charges in Los Angeles after telling his legal team that he refused to subject his family to another round of anguish and humiliation after a gut-wrenching gun trial in Delaware three months ago.
周四，亨特·拜登在洛杉矶对九项联邦税收指控认罪，此前他告诉他的法律团队，在三个月前特拉华州那场令人痛苦的涉枪案审判后，他不想让家人再遭受一轮痛苦和羞辱

“There was only one path left for me,” he added. “I will not subject my family to more pain, more invasions of privacy and needless embarrassment. For all I have put them through over the years, I can spare them this, and so I have decided to plead guilty.”
“我只有一条路可走，”他还说。“我不会让我的家人遭受更多的痛苦，更多的隐私侵犯和不必要的羞辱。尽管这些年来我让他们经历了这么多，但我可以不让他们承受这些，所以我决定认罪。”

As technology has made it easier than ever to spread information, attention became a scarce resource, and the ensuing battle for attention resulted in a deluge of toxic information. But the battle lines are now shifting from attention to intimacy. The new generative artificial intelligence is capable of not only producing texts, images and videos, but also conversing with us directly, pretending to be human.
随着技术使信息传播变得比以往任何时候都更容易，注意力成了一种稀缺资源，随之而来的注意力争夺战导致了有害信息泛滥。但战线正从注意力转向亲密。新的生成式人工智能不仅能生成文本、图像和视频，还能与我们直接交谈，假装人类

African flags have been flown over Tiananmen Square. Leaders of African nations have been greeted by dancers, honor guards and children waving flags. They have been escorted in extensive motorcades past banners celebrating “A Shared Future for China and Africa” and giant, elaborate flower arrangements.
天安门广场上飘扬着非洲国家的国旗。非洲国家的领导人受到了舞者、仪仗队和挥舞旗帜的儿童的欢迎。在浩浩荡荡的车队护送下，他们经过街道两侧悬挂的“中非共命运合作启新程”的道旗，以及精心布置的巨型花坛

President William Ruto of Kenya, for instance, hopes to get funding to finish a railway line from the Rift Valley to Malaba town on Kenya’s western border with Uganda. He is also looking for more investment to build roads and dams and set up an industrial park for pharmaceutical companies.
比如，肯尼亚总统鲁托希望获得资金，修建一条从非洲大裂谷到肯尼亚西部与乌干达接壤的城镇马拉巴的铁路。他还在寻求更多投资，以修建公路和大坝，并为制药企业建立一个工业园。

In the run-up to the summit, Chinese state media outlets have highlighted projects backed by Chinese lenders in African villages, like solar panel installations and soybean-planting techniques, as bringing direct benefits to communities.It has this aspect of making sure that the China-Africa relationship, at least on a global scale, doesn’t look predatory
在峰会召开前夕，中国的官方媒体在报道中强调中国的贷款机构在非洲农村所支持的项目，如太阳能电池板安装和大豆种植技术，称其为社区带来了直接的好处。这样做的目的是要确保中非关系，至少在全球范围内，不会看起来像是掠夺性的关系

Ms. Brautigam said that the summit follows months of behind-the-scenes diplomacy between Chinese and African officials. “You can contrast this with how we do things in the U.S., where engagement is far more ad hoc,” she said.
布劳蒂加姆表示，这次峰会是中非官员数月幕后外交的结果。“这与我们在美国的做法形成了鲜明对比，我们之间的接触更加零散，”她说。

China has also won support on the African continent for the position it has taken on Israel’s war in Gaza. Beijing has brought rival Palestinian factions together for talks as it has sought a bigger diplomatic role in the Middle East. It has asserted its longstanding support of Palestinian statehood and criticized Israel’s bombardment of the region.
中国对以色列在加沙的战争所采取的立场也赢得了非洲国家的支持。中国政府希望在中东地区发挥更大的外交作用，已将巴勒斯坦敌对派系召集到一起进行谈判。它坚持对巴勒斯坦建国的长期支持，并批评以色列对该地区的轰炸。

That position aligns China with countries like South Africa, which has called Israel’s policies toward Palestinians an “extreme form of apartheid.” “China’s full embrace of the Palestinian cause has fully aligned it with almost the entire global south,” said Mr. Olander. For many Africans, he added, the war “closely resembles the colonial wars that ravaged their countries.”
中国的这一立场与南非等国一致。南非称以色列对巴勒斯坦人的政策是“极端形式的种族隔离”。奥兰德表示，“中国对巴勒斯坦事业的全面支持，与几乎整个全球南方是完全一致的。”他还说，对许多非洲人来说，这场战争“与摧毁他们国家的殖民战争非常相似”。

For all his ludicrous boasting about his past debate performances, many of them have been laughable — some combination of puerile taunting, nonpareil lying, sulking, steaming, glaring and gloating. You know those cartoonish dances that football players do when they’ve breached the end zone in the fourth quarter of a close game? That’s Trump at the debate lectern, only he hasn’t scored a touchdown. Or even moved the ball so much as a millimeter downfield.
尽管他对自己过去的辩论表现进行了荒唐的吹嘘，但其中许多都是可笑的——幼稚的嘲弄、无与伦比的谎言、愠怒、发火、目露凶光和幸灾乐祸的结合。你知道橄榄球员在一场势均力敌的比赛的第四节达阵得分时跳的那种卡通式的舞蹈吗？那就是辩论台上的特朗普，唯一区别是他没达阵。他的球甚至根本没有往前推进。

It’s easy to find examples of Vice President Kamala Harris answering questions in a vacuous, speciously thoughtful manner that borders on caricature, and it’s easy to conclude from that oratorical oatmeal that she has delayed a one-on-one sit-down with a serious journalist because she’s not nimble in unscripted situations or fluent in the necessary facts. Those are the Republican talking points, anyway.
贺锦丽副总统以一种空洞无物、似是而非、几乎像讽刺漫画一般的方式回答问题，这样的例子很多，从她那些平淡乏味的演讲中很容易得出这样的结论：她之所以迟迟没有同一位严肃记者进行一对一的面谈，是因为她在没有脚本的情况下不够灵活，也没有熟练掌握必要的事实。反正共和党整天这么说。

Ms. Ma had no experience with the law and didn’t know whom to ask for help. Other villagers accused her of trying to claim what didn’t belong to her. Her brothers told her not to make a fuss.She bought a copy of China’s civil code to educate herself. She repeatedly called and visited government offices, though they refused to accept her case. “If I waited until others came forward, I wouldn’t have anything,” she said.
马女士没有法律经验，也不知道该向谁求助。其他村民指责她索取不属于她的东西。她的兄弟们叫她不要小题大做。她买了一本中国民法典自学。她多次致电并拜访政府部门，但他们拒绝受理她的案件。“等人家出头你啥都没有，”她说。

Dawn Michelle Hunt loved sweepstakes. A 42-year-old temp worker in Chicago, she entered almost every contest she encountered. So when she got an email from someone who described himself as a British lawyer saying she had won a trip to Australia, she was elated.
道恩·米歇尔·亨特热衷参加抽奖活动。作为芝加哥的一名42岁的临时工，她几乎不会错过自己遇到的每一个抽奖活动。因此，当她收到一个自称英国律师的人发来的电子邮件，说她赢得了去澳大利亚旅行的机会时，她欣喜若狂。

“Regions are becoming more Balkanized,” said Patrick Moorhead, the founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, a tech research firm. “It is slowing down the pace of output for Apple, as each region becomes more bespoke.”
“各地区正变得更加巴尔干化，”科技研究公司摩尔视界与战略的创始人帕特里克·穆尔黑德说。“随着每个地区的定制化程度越来越高，苹果的产出速度也在放缓。”

The Huawei phone, called the Mate 60 Pro, was heralded in China as the triumph of a national champion over American constraints. It sold out within minutes on Chinese e-commerce platforms. Many shoppers chose to pair their purchase with a phone case emblazoned with a photo of Ms. Raimondo’s face.The Mate XT, with a screen that measures 10.2 inches diagonally, is equipped with artificial intelligence-enabled translation, messaging and photo editing features.
中国将那款名为Mate 60 Pro的华为手机誉为本国企业冠军打破美国技术限制取得的胜利。该款手机在中国电子商务平台上几分钟就销售一空。许多购物者还为购来的手机选择了背后印有雷蒙多头像的手机壳。Mate XT三屏态时屏幕的对角线长10.2英寸，配有人工智能翻译工具、短信应用，以及照片编辑功能。

At times, he has seemed to lose his cool with women in these settings. When, during their third debate in 2016, Mrs. Clinton accused him of being a puppet of Vladimir Putin, he practically barked that he was rubber and she was glue. But he is still reaching for caustic and belittling attacks when it comes to Ms. Harris.
在这种情形下，他有时会在女性面前失态。2016年，在他们的第三次辩论中，希拉里指责他是普京的傀儡，他几乎咆哮着说自己是橡皮，而她是胶水（橡皮和胶水是儿童斗嘴时的一句话，意思是你骂我的话全部反弹回去粘到你身上。——译注）但当涉及贺锦丽时，他仍然采用尖刻和贬低的攻击。

A glowering Mr. Trump often took the bait, responding to Ms. Harris’s critiques with a hail of misinformation and personal attacks during the debate broadcast from Philadelphia by ABC News. Roughly an hour after it ended, he made his way to the so-called spin room — an unusual appearance by a candidate in the space where campaign surrogates speak.
在ABC新闻于费城转播的这场辩论中，怒气冲冲的特朗普经常上钩，用大量错误信息和人身攻击来回应贺锦丽的批评。辩论结束约一小时后，他来到了采访室——候选人出现在竞选代言人发言的地方，是很不寻常的

At points, Ms. Harris put her hand under her chin as she watched Mr. Trump’s answers with skeptical amazement, laughing out loud when he repeated false and outlandish claims that immigrants were stealing and eating their neighbors’ pets in an Ohio town.
贺锦丽有时会用手撑着下巴，用怀疑的眼光惊讶地看着特朗普的回答，当他一再提起俄亥俄州一个小镇的移民把邻居宠物偷来吃掉的虚假离奇说法时，她笑出了声

Will and Rose met online 10 years ago. His screen name was professorparsley, and he looked the part — tall and thin, with glasses, features that Rose found attractive.Rose was drawn to how stable Will seemed — so unlike the other men she had dated, who dreaded commitment. Will is gone during the day, teaching, and at night they cuddle in bed and watch television.As much as Will grounds her, Rose feels that the familiar calm of their relationship also shuts her down sexually.
威尔和罗丝是十年前在网上认识的。他的网名是“欧芹教授”，看上去很合适——又高又瘦，戴着眼镜，这些都很吸引罗丝。罗丝喜欢威尔的稳重——和她约会过的其他男人不同，他们害怕承诺。威尔白天出去教书，晚上他们依偎在床上看电视。虽然威尔让她感觉踏实，但罗丝觉得他们习惯的平静关系也让她在性方面感到压抑。

They savored their extra time together. Rose used to spend hours driving in traffic to different workout studios, They talked constantly. They started taking online yoga classes together, a hobby that stuck. Will appreciates these smaller opportunities to connect. Rose thinks she’s not the nurturing type, but Will disagrees. “She’s not stingy in spirit or time,” he says.
他们很享受有更多在一起的时间。罗丝过去常常花几个小时开车去不同的健身房，不停地交谈。他们开始一起上在线瑜伽课，这个爱好一直延续了下来。威尔很欣赏这些小小的交流机会。罗丝认为她不是那种会照顾人的人，但威尔不这么认为。“她在精神上和时间上都不吝啬，”他说。

The question is who has a better read on the American psyche eight weeks before the final ballots are cast. For the past two decades, most Americans have told pollsters that they believe the country is on the wrong track, a prolonged period of national disenchantment that Mr. Trump has successfully channeled throughout his tumultuous political career. But Ms. Harris argues that Mr. Trump is the one who wants to take the nation back down a path to nowhere.
问题是，在最终投票前的八周，谁能更好地解读美国人的心理。在过去的二十年里，大多数美国人告诉民调机构，他们认为美国走在错误的轨道上，特朗普在他动荡的政治生涯里成功地引导了这一长期的国民失望情绪。但贺锦丽认为，特朗普才是那个想把美国带回一条死路上的人。

Mr. Trump has always been about extremes, articulating an all-or-nothing Manichaean worldview in which the country is a virtual paradise on earth when he is in charge and going to hell when he is not. Ms. Harris offers subtlety and nuance in a political environment that does not always value either. She boasts of progress not perfection, promises seriousness not self-absorption. 
特朗普一直走极端，他阐述了一种非此即彼的摩尼教世界观，在这种世界观里，当他掌权时，这个国家几乎就是人间天堂，当他不掌权时，这个国家就会下地狱。贺锦丽在一个并不总是重视微妙表达和细微差别的政治环境中提供了这些特质。她赞美进步而不是完美，承诺认真而不是自我陶醉。

Most head-snapping was Mr. Trump’s decision to latch onto a bizarre tale of Haitian immigrants supposedly snatching and devouring pets in Springfield, Ohio, an internet rumor debunked by incredulous local authorities. It is not a new shtick, although it seems more pronounced than ever. 
最让人大跌眼镜的是，特朗普决定抓住一个离奇的故事不放，据说海地移民在俄亥俄州斯普林菲尔德抢走人们的宠物并将它们吃掉，这是一个被较真的地方当局澄清的网络谣言.这并非什么新手法，尽管它似乎比以往任何时候都更加明显。

Ms. Harris, who ducked some questions, gave vague answers to others and at times stretched the truth herself, though not as brazenly as her opponent, kept the focus on Mr. Trump.Ms. Harris got under his skin repeatedly, needling him and putting him on the defensive. Indeed, while judges have scolded him and prosecutors have accused him, no one in years has trolled Mr. Trump to his face on a public stage quite like she did. 
贺锦丽回避了一些问题，对一些问题给出了模糊的回答，有时也会夸大事实——尽管不像她的对手那样肆无忌惮，但她还是把焦点放在特朗普身上。贺锦丽一再激怒他，让他陷入被动。的确，尽管法官斥责过他，检察官也指控过他，但多年来，没有人像她那样在公开场合当面奚落特朗普。

The United States, a country built by immigrants, has become a daunting — and expensive — destination for everybody who aspires to be part of what it represents: freedom, opportunity and even wealth, a place where people are largely left to be whomever they want to be.In an attempt to beat the long odds, some Chinese H-1B applicants pray to Buddha.
美国是一个由移民建立起来的国家，它代表着自由、机会甚至财富，是一个人们可以成就理想的地方，但是对于那些渴望成为它的一部分人来说，它已经成为一个令人生畏且代价高昂的目的地.为了这渺茫的机会，一些中国H-1B申请人求神拜佛

But to many women, these deepfakes are just the latest online expression of a deep-rooted misogyny in their country — a culture that has now produced young men who consider it fun to share sexually humiliating images of women​ online.
但对许多女性来说，这些深度伪造只是她们国家根深蒂固的厌女文化在网上的最新表现，这种文化现在培养出了认为在网上分享羞辱女性的色情图片很有趣的年轻男性。

It’s easy to find examples of Vice President Kamala Harris answering questions in a vacuous, speciously thoughtful manner that borders on caricature, and it’s easy to conclude from that oratorical oatmeal that she has delayed a one-on-one sit-down with a serious journalist because she’s not nimble in unscripted situations or fluent in the necessary facts.

Harris is catching Trump at the perfect moment — for her — because he at times seems to be flaming out. He’s certainly committing odd flubs and making strange choices. Which gives her a debating edge over him, assuming she can maintain the discipline and poise that she has demonstrated during her crash-course presidential campaign so far. The more she keeps her cool, the more he’ll lose his.And he’s harrumphing toward a humbling. Should be a riveting moment in an election year with no shortage of those.
贺锦丽正好赶上了对她来说最佳的时机与特朗普对阵——因为他屡屡显露低迷的样子。他确实在犯奇怪的错误，做出奇怪的选择。这让她在辩论中比他更有优势，前提是她能保持迄今为止在这个总统竞选速成班中表现出的自律和沉着。她越是保持冷静，他就越会失去冷静。他正在咆哮着走向威风扫地的结局。在这个充满精彩的大选年，这应该是一个格外精彩的时刻。

G.M. has also struggled to get its electric vehicle unit off the ground. And the big, bloated cars on America’s roads have created a profound safety crisis — America’s roads are, by one measure, more dangerous than Russia’s in part because of our gargantuan gas-guzzling vehicles.More important, batteries are the kind of technology that will ripple across the economy and society, much like lasers, satellites and semiconductors. 
通用汽车也一直在让其电动汽车部门起步上困难重重。美国道路上大型、臃肿的汽车已制造了一种严重的安全危机，在某种程度上，美国的道路比俄罗斯的还危险，部分原因是我们的道路上行驶着耗油量大的庞然大物。更重要的是，电池将像激光、卫星和半导体那样，成为一种对经济和社会产生连锁影响的技术。

Donald Trump was talking about what he couldn’t stop talking about — the millions of migrants who, he insisted, were depraved criminals being dumped on us by cackling foreign leaders — and in his indiscriminate zest to describe an American hellscape, he repeated debunked stories that in Springfield, Ohio, these desperate newcomers were noshing on Fido and Whiskers.
唐纳德·特朗普在说一个让他停不下来的话题——他坚称那些外国领导人狞笑着把成百上千万的移民扔到我们头上，这些人都是道德败坏的罪犯，他用指天骂地的激情描绘了一个地狱般的美国，他转述了发生在俄亥俄州斯普林菲尔德的一个已经被辟谣的故事，说这些初来乍到的恶人正在把你家的喵星人汪星人当点心吃掉

Some dark fantasies need immediate dispelling. And some deranged fantasists need to be tugged back into reality before they wander so far from it that there’s no returning.Trump made a raving, rambling fool of himself on Tuesday night, and while Harris by no means did everything right, she had the good sense to alternately call him out on that and simply watch him unravel.He looked livid.She looked amused.He scowled.She smiled.
有些阴暗的幻想，需要立即驱散。而有些精神错乱的幻想者，需要被拉回到现实里来，否则他们会越飘越远，再也回不来。对狂乱而恍惚的特朗普来说，这是个丢人现眼的夜晚，贺锦丽远远谈不上完备，但她只需要戳穿他，然后看着他自己曝露自己，就可以了。他看上去怒不可遏。她看上去意兴盎然。他绷着脸。她在微笑。

After a slightly rocky start, she projected confidence.After a somewhat confident start, he staggered down the rockiest of roads. Trump’s vocabulary disintegrated entirely by night’s end. He was a broken record with lyrics as redundant as they were incoherent.Will that performance hurt him on Nov. 5? Impossible to say, because at this point the battiness is old hat. But he was a particularly unattractive version of his titanically arrogant, spectacularly dishonest and shockingly ill-informed self, claiming that Democrats were slaughtering newborns,
虽然开头有些踉跄，她还是展现了自信心。虽然开头显得好像有些自信，他接下来一路跌跌撞撞。特朗普到最后已经彻底词穷。他就像一张破唱片，而且歌词显得既冗赘又语无伦次。这次的表现，会影响他在11月5日的成绩吗？这是无法确定的，毕竟错乱癫狂对我们来说都已经习以为常。但他那无与伦比的自大，他的谎话连篇，他那骇人的无知，这一次以格外难看的方式呈现了出来，他声称民主党人在杀害新生儿
