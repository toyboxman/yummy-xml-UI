The JSON format
There are just a few rules that you need to remember:
Objects are encapsulated within opening and closing brackets { }
An empty object can be represented by { }
Arrays are encapsulated within opening and closing square brackets [ ]
An empty array can be represented by [ ]
A member is represented by a key-value pair
The key of a member should be contained in double quotes. (JavaScript does not require this. JavaScript and some parsers will tolerate single-quotes)
Each member should have a unique key within an object structure
The value of a member must be contained in double quotes if it's a string (JavaScript and some parsers will tolerates single-quotes)
Boolean values are represented using the true or false literals in lower case
Number values are represented using double-precision floating-point format. Scientific notation is supported
Numbers should not have leading zeroes
"Offensive"" characters in a string need to be escaped using the backslash character
Null values are represented by the null literal in lower case
Other object types, such as dates, are not properly supported and should be converted to strings. It becomes the responsability of the parser/client to manage this.
Each member of an object or each array value must be followed by a comma if it's not the last one
The common extension for json files is '.json'
The mime type for json files is 'application/json'
